        "content": "\n\nLet's see what's so special about JavaScript, what we can achieve with it, and which other technologies play well with it.\n\n## What is JavaScript?\n\n*JavaScript* was initially created to \"make web pages alive\".\n\nThe programs in this language are called *scripts*. They can be written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads.\n\nScripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don't need special preparation or compilation to run.\n\nIn this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)).\n\n```smart header=\"Why is it called <u>Java</u>Script?\"\nWhen JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: \"LiveScript\". But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a \"younger brother\" of Java would help.\n\nBut as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called [ECMAScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript), and now it has no relation to Java at all.\n```\n\nToday, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called [the JavaScript engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine).\n\nThe browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a \"JavaScript virtual machine\".\n\nDifferent engines have different \"codenames\". For example:\n\n- [V8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)) -- in Chrome and Opera.\n- [SpiderMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey) -- in Firefox.\n- ...There are other codenames like \"Trident\" and \"Chakra\" for different versions of IE, \"ChakraCore\" for Microsoft Edge, \"Nitro\" and \"SquirrelFish\" for Safari, etc.\n\nThe terms above are good to remember because they are used in developer articles on the internet. We'll use them too. For instance, if \"a feature X is supported by V8\", then it probably works in Chrome and Opera.\n\n```smart header=\"How do engines work?\"\n\nEngines are complicated. But the basics are easy.\n\n1. The engine (embedded if it's a browser) reads (\"parses\") the script.\n2. Then it converts (\"compiles\") the script to the machine language.\n3. And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.\n\nThe engine applies optimizations at each step of the process. It even watches the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the data that flows through it, and further optimizes the machine code based on that knowledge.\n```\n\n## What can in-browser JavaScript do?\n\nModern JavaScript is a \"safe\" programming language. It does not provide low-level access to memory or CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it.\n\nJavaScript's capabilities greatly depend on the environment it's running in. For instance, [Node.js](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) supports functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests, etc.\n\nIn-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.\n\nFor instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to:\n\n- Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.\n- React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.\n- Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) and [COMET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)) technologies).\n- Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.\n- Remember the data on the client-side (\"local storage\").\n\n## What CAN'T in-browser JavaScript do?\n\nJavaScript's abilities in the browser are limited for the sake of the user's safety. The aim is to prevent an evil webpage from accessing private information or harming the user's data.\n\nExamples of such restrictions include:\n\n- JavaScript on a webpage may not read/write arbitrary files on the hard disk, copy them or execute programs. It has no direct access to OS functions.\n\n    Modern browsers allow it to work with files, but the access is limited and only provided if the user does certain actions, like \"dropping\" a file into a browser window or selecting it via an `<input>` tag.\n\n    There are ways to interact with camera/microphone and other devices, but they require a user's explicit permission. So a JavaScript-enabled page may not sneakily enable a web-camera, observe the surroundings and send the information to the [NSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency).\n- Different tabs/windows generally do not know about each other. Sometimes they do, for example when one window uses JavaScript to open the other one. But even in this case, JavaScript from one page may not access the other if they come from different sites (from a different domain, protocol or port).\n\n    This is called the \"Same Origin Policy\". To work around that, *both pages* must agree for data exchange and contain a special JavaScript code that handles it. We'll cover that in the tutorial.\n\n    This limitation is, again, for the user's safety. A page from `http://anysite.com` which a user has opened must not be able to access another browser tab with the URL `http://gmail.com` and steal information from there.\n- JavaScript can easily communicate over the net to the server where the current page came from. But its ability to receive data from other sites/domains is crippled. Though possible, it requires explicit agreement (expressed in HTTP headers) from the remote side. Once again, that's a safety limitation.\n\n![](limitations.svg)\n\nSuch limits do not exist if JavaScript is used outside of the browser, for example on a server. Modern browsers also allow plugin/extensions which may ask for extended permissions.\n\n## What makes JavaScript unique?\n\nThere are at least *three* great things about JavaScript:\n\n```compare\n+ Full integration with HTML/CSS.\n+ Simple things are done simply.\n+ Support by all major browsers and enabled by default.\n```\nJavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these three things.\n\nThat's what makes JavaScript unique. That's why it's the most widespread tool for creating browser interfaces.\n\nThat said, JavaScript also allows to create servers, mobile applications, etc.\n\n## Languages \"over\" JavaScript\n\nThe syntax of JavaScript does not suit everyone's needs. Different people want different features.\n\nThat's to be expected, because projects and requirements are different for everyone.\n\nSo recently a plethora of new languages appeared, which are *transpiled* (converted) to JavaScript before they run in the browser.\n\nModern tools make the transpilation very fast and transparent, actually allowing developers to code in another language and auto-converting it \"under the hood\".\n\nExamples of such languages:\n\n- [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) is a \"syntactic sugar\" for JavaScript. It introduces shorter syntax, allowing us to write clearer and more precise code. Usually, Ruby devs like it.\n- [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) is concentrated on adding \"strict data typing\" to simplify the development and support of complex systems. It is developed by Microsoft.\n- [Flow](http://flow.org/) also adds data typing, but in a different way. Developed by Facebook.\n- [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) is a standalone language that has its own engine that runs in non-browser environments (like mobile apps), but also can be transpiled to JavaScript. Developed by Google.\n\nThere are more. Of course, even if we use one of transpiled languages, we should also know JavaScript to really understand what we're doing.\n\n## Summary\n\n- JavaScript was initially created as a browser-only language, but is now used in many other environments as well.\n- Today, JavaScript has a unique position as the most widely-adopted browser language with full integration with HTML/CSS.\n- There are many languages that get \"transpiled\" to JavaScript and provide certain features. It is recommended to take a look at them, at least briefly, after mastering JavaScript.",

But once you're familiar with the basics, you'll need other sources.\n\n## Specification\n\n[The ECMA-262 specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) contains the most in-depth, detailed and formalized information about JavaScript. It defines the language.\n\nBut being that formalized, it's difficult to understand at first. So if you need the most trustworthy source of information about the language details, the specification is the right place. But it's not for everyday use.\n\nA new specification version is released every year. In-between these releases, the latest specification draft is at <https://tc39.es/ecma262/>.\n\nTo read about new bleeding-edge features, including those that are \"almost standard\" (so-called \"stage 3\"), see proposals at <https://github.com/tc39/proposals>.\n\nAlso, if you're in developing for the browser, then there are other specs covered in the [second part](info:browser-environment) of the tutorial.\n\n## Manuals\n\n- **MDN (Mozilla) JavaScript Reference** is a manual with examples and other information. It's great to get in-depth information about individual language functions, methods etc.\n\n    One can find it at <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference>.\n\n    Although, it's often best to use an internet search instead. Just use \"MDN [term]\" in the query, e.g. <https://google.com/search?q=MDN+parseInt> to search for `parseInt` function.\n\n\n- **MSDN** – Microsoft manual with a lot of information, including JavaScript (often referred to as JScript). If one needs something specific to Internet Explorer, better go there: <http://msdn.microsoft.com/>.\n\n    Also, we can use an internet search with phrases such as \"RegExp MSDN\" or \"RegExp MSDN jscript\".\n\n## Compatibility tables\n\nJavaScript is a developing language, new features get added regularly.\n\nTo see their support among browser-based and other engines, see:\n\n- <http://caniuse.com> - per-feature tables of support, e.g. to see which engines support modern cryptography functions: <http://caniuse.com/#feat=cryptography>.\n- <https://kangax.github.io/compat-table> - a table with language features and engines that support those or don't support.\n\nAll these resources are useful in real-life development, as they contain valuable information about language details, their support etc.\n\nPlease remember them (or this page) for the cases when you need in-depth information about a particular feature.",

        "content": "\n\nA code editor is the place where programmers spend most of their time.\n\nThere are two main types of code editors: IDEs and lightweight editors. Many people use one tool of each type.\n\n## IDE\n\nThe term [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (Integrated Development Environment) refers to a powerful editor with many features that usually operates on a \"whole project.\" As the name suggests, it's not just an editor, but a full-scale \"development environment.\"\n\nAn IDE loads the project (which can be many files), allows navigation between files, provides autocompletion based on the whole project (not just the open file), and integrates with a version management system (like [git](https://git-scm.com/)), a testing environment, and other \"project-level\" stuff.\n\nIf you haven't selected an IDE yet, consider the following options:\n\n- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (cross-platform, free).\n- [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (cross-platform, paid).\n\nFor Windows, there's also \"Visual Studio\", not to be confused with \"Visual Studio Code\". \"Visual Studio\" is a paid and mighty Windows-only editor, well-suited for the .NET platform. It's also good at JavaScript. There's also a free version [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/).\n\nMany IDEs are paid, but have a trial period. Their cost is usually negligible compared to a qualified developer's salary, so just choose the best one for you.\n\n## Lightweight editors\n\n\"Lightweight editors\" are not as powerful as IDEs, but they're fast, elegant and simple.\n\nThey are mainly used to open and edit a file instantly.\n\nThe main difference between a \"lightweight editor\" and an \"IDE\" is that an IDE works on a project-level, so it loads much more data on start, analyzes the project structure if needed and so on. A lightweight editor is much faster if we need only one file.\n\nIn practice, lightweight editors may have a lot of plugins including directory-level syntax analyzers and autocompleters, so there's no strict border between a lightweight editor and an IDE.\n\nThe following options deserve your attention:\n\n- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (cross-platform, free).\n- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (cross-platform, free).\n- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) (cross-platform, shareware).\n- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows, free).\n- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) are also cool if you know how to use them.\n\n## Let's not argue\n\nThe editors in the lists above are those that either I or my friends whom I consider good developers have been using for a long time and are happy with.\n\nThere are other great editors in our big world. Please choose the one you like the most.\n\nThe choice of an editor, like any other tool, is individual and depends on your projects, habits, and personal preferences.",

You are *absolutely* going to make errors, at least if you're a human, not a [robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bender_(Futurama)).\n\nBut in the browser, users don't see errors by default. So, if something goes wrong in the script, we won't see what's broken and can't fix it.\n\nTo see errors and get a lot of other useful information about scripts, \"developer tools\" have been embedded in browsers.\n\nMost developers lean towards Chrome or Firefox for development because those browsers have the best developer tools. Other browsers also provide developer tools, sometimes with special features, but are usually playing \"catch-up\" to Chrome or Firefox. So most developers have a \"favorite\" browser and switch to others if a problem is browser-specific.\n\nDeveloper tools are potent; they have many features. To start, we'll learn how to open them, look at errors, and run JavaScript commands.\n\n## Google Chrome\n\nOpen the page [bug.html](bug.html).\n\nThere's an error in the JavaScript code on it. It's hidden from a regular visitor's eyes, so let's open developer tools to see it.\n\nPress `key:F12` or, if you're on Mac, then `key:Cmd+Opt+J`.\n\nThe developer tools will open on the Console tab by default.\n\nIt looks somewhat like this:\n\n![chrome](chrome.png)\n\nThe exact look of developer tools depends on your version of Chrome. It changes from time to time but should be similar.\n\n- Here we can see the red-colored error message. In this case, the script contains an unknown \"lalala\" command.\n- On the right, there is a clickable link to the source `bug.html:12` with the line number where the error has occurred.\n\nBelow the error message, there is a blue `>` symbol. It marks a \"command line\" where we can type JavaScript commands. Press `key:Enter` to run them.\n\nNow we can see errors, and that's enough for a start. We'll come back to developer tools later and cover debugging more in-depth in the chapter <info:debugging-chrome>.\n\n```smart header=\"Multi-line input\"\nUsually, when we put a line of code into the console, and then press `key:Enter`, it executes.\n\nTo insert multiple lines, press `key:Shift+Enter`. This way one can enter long fragments of JavaScript code.\n```\n\n## Firefox, Edge, and others\n\nMost other browsers use `key:F12` to open developer tools.\n\nThe look & feel of them is quite similar. Once you know how to use one of these tools (you can start with Chrome), you can easily switch to another.\n\n## Safari\n\nSafari (Mac browser, not supported by Windows/Linux) is a little bit special here. We need to enable the \"Develop menu\" first.\n\nOpen Preferences and go to the \"Advanced\" pane. There's a checkbox at the bottom:\n\n![safari](safari.png)\n\nNow `key:Cmd+Opt+C` can toggle the console. Also, note that the new top menu item named \"Develop\" has appeared. It has many commands and options.\n\n## Summary\n\n- Developer tools allow us to see errors, run commands, examine variables, and much more.\n- They can be opened with `key:F12` for most browsers on Windows. Chrome for Mac needs `key:Cmd+Opt+J`, Safari: `key:Cmd+Opt+C` (need to enable first).\n\nNow we have the environment ready. In the next section, we'll get down to JavaScript.",

        "content": "\n\nThis part of the tutorial is about core JavaScript, the language itself.\n\nBut we need a working environment to run our scripts and, since this book is online, the browser is a good choice. We'll keep the amount of browser-specific commands (like `alert`) to a minimum so that you don't spend time on them if you plan to concentrate on another environment (like Node.js). We'll focus on JavaScript in the browser in the [next part](/ui) of the tutorial.\n\nSo first, let's see how we attach a script to a webpage. For server-side environments (like Node.js), you can execute the script with a command like `\"node my.js\"`.\n\n\n## The \"script\" tag\n\nJavaScript programs can be inserted into any part of an HTML document with the help of the `<script>` tag.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run height=100\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html>\n\n<body>\n\n  <p>Before the script...</p>\n\n*!*\n  <script>\n    alert( 'Hello, world!' );\n  </script>\n*/!*\n\n  <p>...After the script.</p>\n\n</body>\n\n</html>\n```\n\n```online\nYou can run the example by clicking the \"Play\" button in the right-top corner of the box above.\n```\n\nThe `<script>` tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed when the browser processes the tag.\n\n\n## Modern markup\n\nThe `<script>` tag has a few attributes that are rarely used nowadays but can still be found in old code:\n\nThe `type` attribute: <code>&lt;script <u>type</u>=...&gt;</code>\n: The old HTML standard, HTML4, required a script to have a `type`. Usually it was `type=\"text/javascript\"`. It's not required anymore. Also, the modern HTML standard totally changed the meaning of this attribute. Now, it can be used for JavaScript modules. But that's an advanced topic, we'll talk about modules in another part of the tutorial.\n\nThe `language` attribute: <code>&lt;script <u>language</u>=...&gt;</code>\n: This attribute was meant to show the language of the script. This attribute no longer makes sense because JavaScript is the default language. There is no need to use it.\n\nComments before and after scripts.\n: In really ancient books and guides, you may find comments inside `<script>` tags, like this:\n\n    ```html no-beautify\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\"><!--\n        ...\n    //--></script>\n    ```\n\n    This trick isn't used in modern JavaScript. These comments hide JavaScript code from old browsers that didn't know how to process the `<script>` tag. Since browsers released in the last 15 years don't have this issue, this kind of comment can help you identify really old code.\n\n\n## External scripts\n\nIf we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a separate file.\n\nScript files are attached to HTML with the `src` attribute:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"/path/to/script.js\"></script>\n```\n\nHere, `/path/to/script.js` is an absolute path to the script from the site root. One can also provide a relative path from the current page. For instance, `src=\"script.js\"` would mean a file `\"script.js\"` in the current folder.\n\nWe can give a full URL as well. For instance:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.js\"></script>\n```\n\nTo attach several scripts, use multiple tags:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"/js/script1.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"/js/script2.js\"></script>\n…\n```\n\n```smart\nAs a rule, only the simplest scripts are put into HTML. More complex ones reside in separate files.\n\nThe benefit of a separate file is that the browser will download it and store it in its [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache).\n\nOther pages that reference the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it, so the file is actually downloaded only once.\n\nThat reduces traffic and makes pages faster.\n```\n\n````warn header=\"If `src` is set, the script content is ignored.\"\nA single `<script>` tag can't have both the `src` attribute and code inside.\n\nThis won't work:\n\n```html\n<script *!*src*/!*=\"file.js\">\n  alert(1); // the content is ignored, because src is set\n</script>\n```\n\nWe must choose either an external `<script src=\"…\">` or a regular `<script>` with code.\n\nThe example above can be split into two scripts to work:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"file.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  alert(1);\n</script>\n```\n````\n\n## Summary\n\n- We can use a `<script>` tag to add JavaScript code to a page.\n- The `type` and `language` attributes are not required.\n- A script in an external file can be inserted with `<script src=\"path/to/script.js\"></script>`.\n\n\nThere is much more to learn about browser scripts and their interaction with the webpage. But let's keep in mind that this part of the tutorial is devoted to the JavaScript language, so we shouldn't distract ourselves with browser-specific implementations of it. We'll be using the browser as a way to run JavaScript, which is very convenient for online reading, but only one of many.",

        "content": "\n\nThe first thing we'll study is the building blocks of code.\n\n## Statements\n\nStatements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.\n\nWe've already seen a statement, `alert('Hello, world!')`, which shows the message \"Hello, world!\".\n\nWe can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.\n\nFor example, here we split \"Hello World\" into two alerts:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nalert('Hello'); alert('World');\n```\n\nUsually, statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nalert('Hello');\nalert('World');\n```\n\n## Semicolons [#semicolon]\n\nA semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.\n\nThis would also work:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nalert('Hello')\nalert('World')\n```\n\nHere, JavaScript interprets the line break as an \"implicit\" semicolon. This is called an [automatic semicolon insertion](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion).\n\n**In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But \"in most cases\" does not mean \"always\"!**\n\nThere are cases when a newline does not mean a semicolon. For example:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nalert(3 +\n1\n+ 2);\n```\n\nThe code outputs `6` because JavaScript does not insert semicolons here. It is intuitively obvious that if the line ends with a plus `\"+\"`, then it is an \"incomplete expression\", so the semicolon is not required. And in this case that works as intended.\n\n**But there are situations where JavaScript \"fails\" to assume a semicolon where it is really needed.**\n\nErrors which occur in such cases are quite hard to find and fix.\n\n````smart header=\"An example of an error\"\nIf you're curious to see a concrete example of such an error, check this code out:\n\n```js run\n[1, 2].forEach(alert)\n```\n\nNo need to think about the meaning of the brackets `[]` and `forEach` yet. We'll study them later. For now, just remember the result of the code: it shows `1` then `2`.\n\nNow, let's add an `alert` before the code and *not* finish it with a semicolon:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nalert(\"There will be an error\")\n\n[1, 2].forEach(alert)\n```\n\nNow if we run the code, only the first `alert` is shown and then we have an error!\n\nBut everything is fine again if we add a semicolon after `alert`:\n```js run\nalert(\"All fine now\");\n\n[1, 2].forEach(alert)  \n```\n\nNow we have the \"All fine now\" message followed by `1` and `2`.\n\n\nThe error in the no-semicolon variant occurs because JavaScript does not assume a semicolon before square brackets `[...]`.\n\nSo, because the semicolon is not auto-inserted, the code in the first example is treated as a single statement. Here's how the engine sees it:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nalert(\"There will be an error\")[1, 2].forEach(alert)\n```\n\nBut it should be two separate statements, not one. Such a merging in this case is just wrong, hence the error. This can happen in other situations.\n````\n\nWe recommend putting semicolons between statements even if they are separated by newlines. This rule is widely adopted by the community. Let's note once again -- *it is possible* to leave out semicolons most of the time. But it's safer -- especially for a beginner -- to use them.\n\n## Comments [#code-comments]\n\nAs time goes on, programs become more and more complex. It becomes necessary to add *comments* which describe what the code does and why.\n\nComments can be put into any place of a script. They don't affect its execution because the engine simply ignores them.\n\n**One-line comments start with two forward slash characters `//`.**\n\nThe rest of the line is a comment. It may occupy a full line of its own or follow a statement.\n\nLike here:\n```js run\n// This comment occupies a line of its own\nalert('Hello');\n\nalert('World'); // This comment follows the statement\n```\n\n**Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk <code>/&#42;</code> and end with an asterisk and a forward slash <code>&#42;/</code>.**\n\nLike this:\n\n```js run\n/* An example with two messages.\nThis is a multiline comment.\n*/\nalert('Hello');\nalert('World');\n```\n\nThe content of comments is ignored, so if we put code inside <code>/&#42; ... &#42;/</code>, it won't execute.\n\nSometimes it can be handy to temporarily disable a part of code:\n\n```js run\n/* Commenting out the code\nalert('Hello');\n*/\nalert('World');\n```\n\n```smart header=\"Use hotkeys!\"\nIn most editors, a line of code can be commented out by pressing the `key:Ctrl+/` hotkey for a single-line comment and something like `key:Ctrl+Shift+/` -- for multiline comments (select a piece of code and press the hotkey). For Mac, try `key:Cmd` instead of `key:Ctrl` and `key:Option` instead of `key:Shift`.\n```\n\n````warn header=\"Nested comments are not supported!\"\nThere may not be `/*...*/` inside another `/*...*/`.\n\nSuch code will die with an error:\n\n```js run no-beautify\n/*\n  /* nested comment ?!? */\n*/\nalert( 'World' );\n```\n````\n\nPlease, don't hesitate to comment your code.\n\nComments increase the overall code footprint, but that's not a problem at all. There are many tools which minify code before publishing to a production server. They remove comments, so they don't appear in the working scripts. Therefore, comments do not have negative effects on production at all.\n\nLater in the tutorial there will be a chapter <info:code-quality> that also explains how to write better comments.",

        "content": "\n\nFor a long time, JavaScript evolved without compatibility issues. New features were added to the language while old functionality didn't change.\n\nThat had the benefit of never breaking existing code. But the downside was that any mistake or an imperfect decision made by JavaScript's creators got stuck in the language forever.\n\nThis was the case until 2009 when ECMAScript 5 (ES5) appeared. It added new features to the language and modified some of the existing ones. To keep the old code working, most such modifications are off by default. You need to explicitly enable them with a special directive: `\"use strict\"`.\n\n## \"use strict\"\n\nThe directive looks like a string: `\"use strict\"` or `'use strict'`. When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the \"modern\" way.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\n\"use strict\";\n\n// this code works the modern way\n...\n```\n\nQuite soon we're going to learn functions (a way to group commands), so let's note in advance that `\"use strict\"` can be put at the beginning of a function. Doing that enables strict mode in that function only. But usually people use it for the whole script.\n\n````warn header=\"Ensure that \\\"use strict\\\" is at the top\"\nPlease make sure that `\"use strict\"` is at the top of your scripts, otherwise strict mode may not be enabled.\n\nStrict mode isn't enabled here:\n\n```js no-strict\nalert(\"some code\");\n// \"use strict\" below is ignored--it must be at the top\n\n\"use strict\";\n\n// strict mode is not activated\n```\n\nOnly comments may appear above `\"use strict\"`.\n````\n\n```warn header=\"There's no way to cancel `use strict`\"\nThere is no directive like `\"no use strict\"` that reverts the engine to old behavior.\n\nOnce we enter strict mode, there's no going back.\n```\n\n## Browser console\n\nWhen you use a [developer console](info:devtools) to run code, please note that it doesn't `use strict` by default.\n\nSometimes, when `use strict` makes a difference, you'll get incorrect results.\n\nSo, how to actually `use strict` in the console?\n\nFirst, you can try to press `key:Shift+Enter` to input multiple lines, and put `use strict` on top, like this:\n\n```js\n'use strict'; <Shift+Enter for a newline>\n//  ...your code\n<Enter to run>\n```\n\nIt works in most browsers, namely Firefox and Chrome.\n\nIf it doesn't, e.g. in an old browser, there's an ugly, but reliable way to ensure `use strict`. Put it inside this kind of wrapper:\n\n```js\n(function() {\n  'use strict';\n\n  // ...your code here...\n})()\n```\n\n## Should we \"use strict\"?\n\nThe question may sound obvious, but it's not so.\n\nOne could recommend to start scripts with `\"use strict\"`... But you know what's cool?\n\nModern JavaScript supports \"classes\" and \"modules\" - advanced language structures (we'll surely get to them), that enable `use strict` automatically. So we don't need to add the `\"use strict\"` directive, if we use them.\n\n**So, for now `\"use strict\";` is a welcome guest at the top of your scripts. Later, when your code is all in classes and modules, you may omit it.**\n\nAs of now, we've got to know about `use strict` in general.\n\nIn the next chapters, as we learn language features, we'll see the differences between the strict and old modes. Luckily, there aren't many and they actually make our lives better.\n\nAll examples in this tutorial assume strict mode unless (very rarely) specified otherwise.",

An online shop -- the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart.\n2. A chat application -- the information might include users, messages, and much more.\n\nVariables are used to store this information.\n\n## A variable\n\nA [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)) is a \"named storage\" for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.\n\nTo create a variable in JavaScript, use the `let` keyword.\n\nThe statement below creates (in other words: *declares*) a variable with the name \"message\":\n\n```js\nlet message;\n```\n\nNow, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator `=`:\n\n```js\nlet message;\n\n*!*\nmessage = 'Hello'; // store the string\n*/!*\n```\n\nThe string is now saved into the memory area associated with the variable. We can access it using the variable name:\n\n```js run\nlet message;\nmessage = 'Hello!';\n\n*!*\nalert(message); // shows the variable content\n*/!*\n```\n\nTo be concise, we can combine the variable declaration and assignment into a single line:\n\n```js run\nlet message = 'Hello!'; // define the variable and assign the value\n\nalert(message); // Hello!\n```\n\nWe can also declare multiple variables in one line:\n\n```js no-beautify\nlet user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';\n```\n\nThat might seem shorter, but we don't recommend it. For the sake of better readability, please use a single line per variable.\n\nThe multiline variant is a bit longer, but easier to read:\n\n```js\nlet user = 'John';\nlet age = 25;\nlet message = 'Hello';\n```\n\nSome people also define multiple variables in this multiline style:\n```js no-beautify\nlet user = 'John',\n  age = 25,\n  message = 'Hello';\n```\n\n...Or even in the \"comma-first\" style:\n\n```js no-beautify\nlet user = 'John'\n  , age = 25\n  , message = 'Hello';\n```\n\nTechnically, all these variants do the same thing. So, it's a matter of personal taste and aesthetics.\n\n````smart header=\"`var` instead of `let`\"\nIn older scripts, you may also find another keyword: `var` instead of `let`:\n\n```js\n*!*var*/!* message = 'Hello';\n```\n\nThe `var` keyword is *almost* the same as `let`. It also declares a variable, but in a slightly different, \"old-school\" way.\n\nThere are subtle differences between `let` and `var`, but they do not matter for us yet. We'll cover them in detail in the chapter <info:var>.\n````\n\n## A real-life analogy\n\nWe can easily grasp the concept of a \"variable\" if we imagine it as a \"box\" for data, with a uniquely-named sticker on it.\n\nFor instance, the variable `message` can be imagined as a box labeled `\"message\"` with the value `\"Hello!\"` in it:\n\n![](variable.svg)\n\nWe can put any value in the box.\n\nWe can also change it as many times as we want:\n```js run\nlet message;\n\nmessage = 'Hello!';\n\nmessage = 'World!'; // value changed\n\nalert(message);\n```\n\nWhen the value is changed, the old data is removed from the variable:\n\n![](variable-change.svg)\n\nWe can also declare two variables and copy data from one into the other.\n\n```js run\nlet hello = 'Hello world!';\n\nlet message;\n\n*!*\n// copy 'Hello world' from hello into message\nmessage = hello;\n*/!*\n\n// now two variables hold the same data\nalert(hello); // Hello world!\nalert(message); // Hello world!\n```\n\n````warn header=\"Declaring twice triggers an error\"\nA variable should be declared only once.\n\nA repeated declaration of the same variable is an error:\n\n```js run\nlet message = \"This\";\n\n// repeated 'let' leads to an error\nlet message = \"That\"; // SyntaxError: 'message' has already been declared\n```\nSo, we should declare a variable once and then refer to it without `let`.\n````\n\n```smart header=\"Functional languages\"\nIt's interesting to note that there exist [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) programming languages, like [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) or [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) that forbid changing variable values.\n\nIn such languages, once the value is stored \"in the box\", it's there forever. If we need to store something else, the language forces us to create a new box (declare a new variable). We can't reuse the old one.\n\nThough it may seem a little odd at first sight, these languages are quite capable of serious development. More than that, there are areas like parallel computations where this limitation confers certain benefits. Studying such a language (even if you're not planning to use it soon) is recommended to broaden the mind.\n```\n\n## Variable naming [#variable-naming]\n\nThere are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:\n\n1. The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols `$` and `_`.\n2. The first character must not be a digit.\n\nExamples of valid names:\n\n```js\nlet userName;\nlet test123;\n```\n\nWhen the name contains multiple words, [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) is commonly used. That is: words go one after another, each word except first starting with a capital letter: `myVeryLongName`.\n\nWhat's interesting -- the dollar sign `'$'` and the underscore `'_'` can also be used in names. They are regular symbols, just like letters, without any special meaning.\n\nThese names are valid:\n\n```js run untrusted\nlet $ = 1; // declared a variable with the name \"$\"\nlet _ = 2; // and now a variable with the name \"_\"\n\nalert($ + _); // 3\n```\n\nExamples of incorrect variable names:\n\n```js no-beautify\nlet 1a; // cannot start with a digit\n\nlet my-name; // hyphens '-' aren't allowed in the name\n```\n\n```smart header=\"Case matters\"\nVariables named `apple` and `AppLE` are two different variables.\n```\n\n````smart header=\"Non-Latin letters are allowed, but not recommended\"\nIt is possible to use any language, including cyrillic letters or even hieroglyphs, like this:\n\n```js\nlet имя = '...';\nlet 我 = '...';\n```\n\nTechnically, there is no error here. Such names are allowed, but there is an international convention to use English in variable names. Even if we're writing a small script, it may have a long life ahead. People from other countries may need to read it some time.\n````\n\n````warn header=\"Reserved names\"\nThere is a [list of reserved words](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords), which cannot be used as variable names because they are used by the language itself.\n\nFor example: `let`, `class`, `return`, and `function` are reserved.\n\nThe code below gives a syntax error:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nlet let = 5; // can't name a variable \"let\", error!\nlet return = 5; // also can't name it \"return\", error!\n```\n````\n\n````warn header=\"An assignment without `use strict`\"\n\nNormally, we need to define a variable before using it. But in the old times, it was technically possible to create a variable by a mere assignment of the value without using `let`. This still works now if we don't put `use strict` in our scripts to maintain compatibility with old scripts.\n\n```js run no-strict\n// note: no \"use strict\" in this example\n\nnum = 5; // the variable \"num\" is created if it didn't exist\n\nalert(num); // 5\n```\n\nThis is a bad practice and would cause an error in strict mode:\n\n```js\n\"use strict\";\n\n*!*\nnum = 5; // error: num is not defined\n*/!*\n```\n````\n\n## Constants\n\nTo declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use `const` instead of `let`:\n\n```js\nconst myBirthday = '18.04.1982';\n```\n\nVariables declared using `const` are called \"constants\". They cannot be reassigned. An attempt to do so would cause an error:\n\n```js run\nconst myBirthday = '18.04.1982';\n\nmyBirthday = '01.01.2001'; // error, can't reassign the constant!\n```\n\nWhen a programmer is sure that a variable will never change, they can declare it with `const` to guarantee and clearly communicate that fact to everyone.\n\n\n### Uppercase constants\n\nThere is a widespread practice to use constants as aliases for difficult-to-remember values that are known prior to execution.\n\nSuch constants are named using capital letters and underscores.\n\nFor instance, let's make constants for colors in so-called \"web\" (hexadecimal) format:\n\n```js run\nconst COLOR_RED = \"#F00\";\nconst COLOR_GREEN = \"#0F0\";\nconst COLOR_BLUE = \"#00F\";\nconst COLOR_ORANGE = \"#FF7F00\";\n\n// ...when we need to pick a color\nlet color = COLOR_ORANGE;\nalert(color); // #FF7F00\n```\n\nBenefits:\n\n- `COLOR_ORANGE` is much easier to remember than `\"#FF7F00\"`.\n- It is much easier to mistype `\"#FF7F00\"` than `COLOR_ORANGE`.\n- When reading the code, `COLOR_ORANGE` is much more meaningful than `#FF7F00`.\n\nWhen should we use capitals for a constant and when should we name it normally? Let's make that clear.\n\nBeing a \"constant\" just means that a variable's value never changes. But there are constants that are known prior to execution (like a hexadecimal value for red) and there are constants that are *calculated* in run-time, during the execution, but do not change after their initial assignment.\n\nFor instance:\n```js\nconst pageLoadTime = /* time taken by a webpage to load */;\n```\n\nThe value of `pageLoadTime` is not known prior to the page load, so it's named normally. But it's still a constant because it doesn't change after assignment.\n\nIn other words, capital-named constants are only used as aliases for \"hard-coded\" values.  \n\n## Name things right\n\nTalking about variables, there's one more extremely important thing.\n\nA variable name should have a clean, obvious meaning, describing the data that it stores.\n\nVariable naming is one of the most important and complex skills in programming. A quick glance at variable names can reveal which code was written by a beginner versus an experienced developer.\n\nIn a real project, most of the time is spent modifying and extending an existing code base rather than writing something completely separate from scratch. When we return to some code after doing something else for a while, it's much easier to find information that is well-labeled. Or, in other words, when the variables have good names.\n\nPlease spend time thinking about the right name for a variable before declaring it. Doing so will repay you handsomely.\n\nSome good-to-follow rules are:\n\n- Use human-readable names like `userName` or `shoppingCart`.\n- Stay away from abbreviations or short names like `a`, `b`, `c`, unless you really know what you're doing.\n- Make names maximally descriptive and concise. Examples of bad names are `data` and `value`. Such names say nothing. It's only okay to use them if the context of the code makes it exceptionally obvious which data or value the variable is referencing.\n- Agree on terms within your team and in your own mind. If a site visitor is called a \"user\" then we should name related variables `currentUser` or `newUser` instead of `currentVisitor` or `newManInTown`.\n\nSounds simple? Indeed it is, but creating descriptive and concise variable names in practice is not. Go for it.\n\n```smart header=\"Reuse or create?\"\nAnd the last note. There are some lazy programmers who, instead of declaring new variables, tend to reuse existing ones.\n\nAs a result, their variables are like boxes into which people throw different things without changing their stickers. What's inside the box now? Who knows? We need to come closer and check.\n\nSuch programmers save a little bit on variable declaration but lose ten times more on debugging.\n\nAn extra variable is good, not evil.\n\nModern JavaScript minifiers and browsers optimize code well enough, so it won't create performance issues. Using different variables for different values can even help the engine optimize your code.\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nWe can declare variables to store data by using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.\n\n- `let` -- is a modern variable declaration.\n- `var` -- is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don't use it at all, but we'll cover subtle differences from `let` in the chapter <info:var>, just in case you need them.\n- `const` -- is like `let`, but the value of the variable can't be changed.\n\nVariables should be named in a way that allows us to easily understand what's inside them.",

        "content": "\n\nA value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For example, a string or a number.\n\nThere are eight basic data types in JavaScript. Here, we'll cover them in general and in the next chapters we'll talk about each of them in detail.\n\nWe can put any type in a variable. For example, a variable can at one moment be a string and then store a number:\n\n```js\n// no error\nlet message = \"hello\";\nmessage = 123456;\n```\n\nProgramming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are called \"dynamically typed\", meaning that there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.\n\n## Number\n\n```js\nlet n = 123;\nn = 12.345;\n```\n\nThe *number* type represents both integer and floating point numbers.\n\nThere are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication `*`, division `/`, addition `+`, subtraction `-`, and so on.\n\nBesides regular numbers, there are so-called \"special numeric values\" which also belong to this data type: `Infinity`, `-Infinity` and `NaN`.\n\n- `Infinity` represents the mathematical [Infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity) ∞. It is a special value that's greater than any number.\n\n    We can get it as a result of division by zero:\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( 1 / 0 ); // Infinity\n    ```\n\n    Or just reference it directly:\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( Infinity ); // Infinity\n    ```\n- `NaN` represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation, for instance:\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( \"not a number\" / 2 ); // NaN, such division is erroneous\n    ```\n\n    `NaN` is sticky. Any further operation on `NaN` returns `NaN`:\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( \"not a number\" / 2 + 5 ); // NaN\n    ```\n\n    So, if there's a `NaN` somewhere in a mathematical expression, it propagates to the whole result.\n\n```smart header=\"Mathematical operations are safe\"\nDoing maths is \"safe\" in JavaScript. We can do anything: divide by zero, treat non-numeric strings as numbers, etc.\n\nThe script will never stop with a fatal error (\"die\"). At worst, we'll get `NaN` as the result.\n```\n\nSpecial numeric values formally belong to the \"number\" type. Of course they are not numbers in the common sense of this word.\n\nWe'll see more about working with numbers in the chapter <info:number>.\n\n## BigInt\n\nIn JavaScript, the \"number\" type cannot represent integer values larger than <code>(2<sup>53</sup>-1)</code> (that's `9007199254740991`), or less than <code>-(-2<sup>53</sup>-1)</code> for negatives. It's a technical limitation caused by their internal representation.\n\nFor most purposes that's quite enough, but sometimes we need really big numbers, e.g. for cryptography or microsecond-precision timestamps.\n\n`BigInt` type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.\n\nA `BigInt` value is created by appending `n` to the end of an integer:\n\n```js\n// the \"n\" at the end means it's a BigInt\nconst bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;\n```\n\nAs `BigInt` numbers are rarely needed, we don't cover them here, but devoted them a separate chapter <info:bigint>. Read it when you need such big numbers.\n\n```smart header=\"Compatability issues\"\nRight now `BigInt` is supported in Firefox/Chrome/Edge, but not in Safari/IE.\n```\n\n## String\n\nA string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.\n\n```js\nlet str = \"Hello\";\nlet str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';\nlet phrase = `can embed another ${str}`;\n```\n\nIn JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.\n\n1. Double quotes: `\"Hello\"`.\n2. Single quotes: `'Hello'`.\n3. Backticks: <code>&#96;Hello&#96;</code>.\n\nDouble and single quotes are \"simple\" quotes. There's practically no difference between them in JavaScript.\n\nBackticks are \"extended functionality\" quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in `${…}`, for example:\n\n```js run\nlet name = \"John\";\n\n// embed a variable\nalert( `Hello, *!*${name}*/!*!` ); // Hello, John!\n\n// embed an expression\nalert( `the result is *!*${1 + 2}*/!*` ); // the result is 3\n```\n\nThe expression inside `${…}` is evaluated and the result becomes a part of the string. We can put anything in there: a variable like `name` or an arithmetical expression like `1 + 2` or something more complex.\n\nPlease note that this can only be done in backticks. Other quotes don't have this embedding functionality!\n```js run\nalert( \"the result is ${1 + 2}\" ); // the result is ${1 + 2} (double quotes do nothing)\n```\n\nWe'll cover strings more thoroughly in the chapter <info:string>.\n\n```smart header=\"There is no *character* type.\"\nIn some languages, there is a special \"character\" type for a single character. For example, in the C language and in Java it is called \"char\".\n\nIn JavaScript, there is no such type. There's only one type: `string`. A string may consist of only one character or many of them.\n```\n\n## Boolean (logical type)\n\nThe boolean type has only two values: `true` and `false`.\n\nThis type is commonly used to store yes/no values: `true` means \"yes, correct\", and `false` means \"no, incorrect\".\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js\nlet nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked\nlet ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked\n```\n\nBoolean values also come as a result of comparisons:\n\n```js run\nlet isGreater = 4 > 1;\n\nalert( isGreater ); // true (the comparison result is \"yes\")\n```\n\nWe'll cover booleans more deeply in the chapter <info:logical-operators>.\n\n## The \"null\" value\n\nThe special `null` value does not belong to any of the types described above.\n\nIt forms a separate type of its own which contains only the `null` value:\n\n```js\nlet age = null;\n```\n\nIn JavaScript, `null` is not a \"reference to a non-existing object\" or a \"null pointer\" like in some other languages.\n\nIt's just a special value which represents \"nothing\", \"empty\" or \"value unknown\".\n\nThe code above states that `age` is unknown.\n\n## The \"undefined\" value\n\nThe special value `undefined` also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like `null`.\n\nThe meaning of `undefined` is \"value is not assigned\".\n\nIf a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is `undefined`:\n\n```js run\nlet age;\n\nalert(age); // shows \"undefined\"\n```\n\nTechnically, it is possible to explicitly assign `undefined` to a variable:\n\n```js run\nlet age = 100;\n\n// change the value to undefined\nage = undefined;\n\nalert(age); // \"undefined\"\n```\n\n...But we don't recommend doing that. Normally, one uses `null` to assign an \"empty\" or \"unknown\" value to a variable, while `undefined` is reserved as a default initial value for unassigned things.\n\n## Objects and Symbols\n\nThe `object` type is special.\n\nAll other types are called \"primitive\" because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.\n\nBeing that important, objects deserve a special treatment. We'll deal with them later in the chapter <info:object>, after we learn more about primitives.\n\nThe `symbol` type is used to create unique identifiers for objects. We have to mention it here for the sake of completeness, but also postpone the details till we know objects.\n\n## The typeof operator [#type-typeof]\n\nThe `typeof` operator returns the type of the argument. It's useful when we want to process values of different types differently or just want to do a quick check.\n\nIt supports two forms of syntax:\n\n1. As an operator: `typeof x`.\n2. As a function: `typeof(x)`.\n\nIn other words, it works with parentheses or without them. The result is the same.\n\nThe call to `typeof x` returns a string with the type name:\n\n```js\ntypeof undefined // \"undefined\"\n\ntypeof 0 // \"number\"\n\ntypeof 10n // \"bigint\"\n\ntypeof true // \"boolean\"\n\ntypeof \"foo\" // \"string\"\n\ntypeof Symbol(\"id\") // \"symbol\"\n\n*!*\ntypeof Math // \"object\"  (1)\n*/!*\n\n*!*\ntypeof null // \"object\"  (2)\n*/!*\n\n*!*\ntypeof alert // \"function\"  (3)\n*/!*\n```\n\nThe last three lines may need additional explanation:\n\n1. `Math` is a built-in object that provides mathematical operations. We will learn it in the chapter <info:number>. Here, it serves just as an example of an object.\n2. The result of `typeof null` is `\"object\"`. That's an officially recognized error in `typeof` behavior, coming from the early days of JavaScript and kept for compatibility. Definitely, `null` is not an object. It is a special value with a separate type of its own.\n3. The result of `typeof alert` is `\"function\"`, because `alert` is a function. We'll study functions in the next chapters where we'll also see that there's no special \"function\" type in JavaScript. Functions belong to the object type. But `typeof` treats them differently, returning `\"function\"`. That also comes from the early days of JavaScript. Technically, such behavior isn't correct, but can be convenient in practice.\n\n## Summary\n\nThere are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.\n\n- `number` for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±2<sup>53</sup>.\n- `bigint` is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.\n- `string` for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there's no separate single-character type.\n- `boolean` for `true`/`false`.\n- `null` for unknown values -- a standalone type that has a single value `null`.\n- `undefined` for unassigned values -- a standalone type that has a single value `undefined`.\n- `object` for more complex data structures.\n- `symbol` for unique identifiers.\n\nThe `typeof` operator allows us to see which type is stored in a variable.\n\n- Two forms: `typeof x` or `typeof(x)`.\n- Returns a string with the name of the type, like `\"string\"`.\n- For `null` returns `\"object\"` -- this is an error in the language, it's not actually an object.\n\nIn the next chapters, we'll concentrate on primitive values and once we're familiar with them, we'll move on to objects.",

It shows a message and waits for the user to presses \"OK\".\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nalert(\"Hello\");\n```\n\nThe mini-window with the message is called a *modal window*. The word \"modal\" means that the visitor can't interact with the rest of the page, press other buttons, etc, until they have dealt with the window. In this case -- until they press \"OK\".\n\n## prompt\n\nThe function `prompt` accepts two arguments:\n\n```js no-beautify\nresult = prompt(title, [default]);\n```\n\nIt shows a modal window with a text message, an input field for the visitor, and the buttons OK/Cancel.\n\n`title`\n: The text to show the visitor.\n\n`default`\n: An optional second parameter, the initial value for the input field.\n\n```smart header=\"The square brackets in syntax `[...]`\"\nThe square brackets around `default` in the syntax above denote that the parameter as optional, not required.\n```\n\nThe visitor can type something in the prompt input field and press OK. Then we get that text in the `result`. Or they can cancel the input by pressing Cancel or hitting the `key:Esc` key, then we get `null` as the `result`.\n\nThe call to `prompt` returns the text from the input field or `null` if the input was canceled.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet age = prompt('How old are you?', 100);\n\nalert(`You are ${age} years old!`); // You are 100 years old!\n```\n\n````warn header=\"In IE: always supply a `default`\"\nThe second parameter is optional, but if we don't supply it, Internet Explorer will insert the text `\"undefined\"` into the prompt.\n\nRun this code in Internet Explorer to see:\n\n```js run\nlet test = prompt(\"Test\");\n```\n\nSo, for prompts to look good in IE, we recommend always providing the second argument:\n\n```js run\nlet test = prompt(\"Test\", ''); // <-- for IE\n```\n````\n\n## confirm\n\nThe syntax:\n\n```js\nresult = confirm(question);\n```\n\nThe function `confirm` shows a modal window with a `question` and two buttons: OK and Cancel.\n\nThe result is `true` if OK is pressed and `false` otherwise.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nlet isBoss = confirm(\"Are you the boss?\");\n\nalert( isBoss ); // true if OK is pressed\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nWe covered 3 browser-specific functions to interact with visitors:\n\n`alert`\n: shows a message.\n\n`prompt`\n: shows a message asking the user to input text. It returns the text or, if Cancel button or `key:Esc` is clicked, `null`.\n\n`confirm`\n: shows a message and waits for the user to press \"OK\" or \"Cancel\". It returns `true` for OK and `false` for Cancel/`key:Esc`.\n\nAll these methods are modal: they pause script execution and don't allow the visitor to interact with the rest of the page until the window has been dismissed.\n\nThere are two limitations shared by all the methods above:\n\n1. The exact location of the modal window is determined by the browser. Usually, it's in the center.\n2. The exact look of the window also depends on the browser. We can't modify it.\n\nThat is the price for simplicity. There are other ways to show nicer windows and richer interaction with the visitor, but if \"bells and whistles\" do not matter much, these methods work just fine.",

        "content": "\n\nMost of the time, operators and functions automatically convert the values given to them to the right type.\n\nFor example, `alert` automatically converts any value to a string to show it. Mathematical operations convert values to numbers.\n\nThere are also cases when we need to explicitly convert a value to the expected type.\n\n```smart header=\"Not talking about objects yet\"\nIn this chapter, we won't cover objects. For now we'll just be talking about primitives.\n\nLater, after we learn about objects, in the chapter <info:object-toprimitive> we'll see how objects fit in.\n```\n\n## String Conversion\n\nString conversion happens when we need the string form of a value.\n\nFor example, `alert(value)` does it to show the value.\n\nWe can also call the `String(value)` function to convert a value to a string:\n\n```js run\nlet value = true;\nalert(typeof value); // boolean\n\n*!*\nvalue = String(value); // now value is a string \"true\"\nalert(typeof value); // string\n*/!*\n```\n\nString conversion is mostly obvious. A `false` becomes `\"false\"`, `null` becomes `\"null\"`, etc.\n\n## Numeric Conversion\n\nNumeric conversion happens in mathematical functions and expressions automatically.\n\nFor example, when division `/` is applied to non-numbers:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"6\" / \"2\" ); // 3, strings are converted to numbers\n```\n\nWe can use the `Number(value)` function to explicitly convert a `value` to a number:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"123\";\nalert(typeof str); // string\n\nlet num = Number(str); // becomes a number 123\n\nalert(typeof num); // number\n```\n\nExplicit conversion is usually required when we read a value from a string-based source like a text form but expect a number to be entered.\n\nIf the string is not a valid number, the result of such a conversion is `NaN`. For instance:\n\n```js run\nlet age = Number(\"an arbitrary string instead of a number\");\n\nalert(age); // NaN, conversion failed\n```\n\nNumeric conversion rules:\n\n| Value |  Becomes... |\n|-------|-------------|\n|`undefined`|`NaN`|\n|`null`|`0`|\n|<code>true&nbsp;and&nbsp;false</code> | `1` and `0` |\n| `string` | Whitespaces from the start and end are removed. If the remaining string is empty, the result is `0`. Otherwise, the number is \"read\" from the string. An error gives `NaN`. |\n\nExamples:\n\n```js run\nalert( Number(\"   123   \") ); // 123\nalert( Number(\"123z\") );      // NaN (error reading a number at \"z\")\nalert( Number(true) );        // 1\nalert( Number(false) );       // 0\n```\n\nPlease note that `null` and `undefined` behave differently here: `null` becomes zero while `undefined` becomes `NaN`.\n\nMost mathematical operators also perform such conversion, we'll see that in the next chapter.\n\n## Boolean Conversion\n\nBoolean conversion is the simplest one.\n\nIt happens in logical operations (later we'll meet condition tests and other similar things) but can also be performed explicitly with a call to `Boolean(value)`.\n\nThe conversion rule:\n\n- Values that are intuitively \"empty\", like `0`, an empty string, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN`, become `false`.\n- Other values become `true`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nalert( Boolean(1) ); // true\nalert( Boolean(0) ); // false\n\nalert( Boolean(\"hello\") ); // true\nalert( Boolean(\"\") ); // false\n```\n\n````warn header=\"Please note: the string with zero `\\\"0\\\"` is `true`\"\nSome languages (namely PHP) treat `\"0\"` as `false`. But in JavaScript, a non-empty string is always `true`.\n\n```js run\nalert( Boolean(\"0\") ); // true\nalert( Boolean(\" \") ); // spaces, also true (any non-empty string is true)\n```\n````\n\n## Summary\n\nThe three most widely used type conversions are to string, to number, and to boolean.\n\n**`String Conversion`** -- Occurs when we output something. Can be performed with `String(value)`. The conversion to string is usually obvious for primitive values.\n\n**`Numeric Conversion`** -- Occurs in math operations. Can be performed with `Number(value)`.\n\nThe conversion follows the rules:\n\n| Value |  Becomes... |\n|-------|-------------|\n|`undefined`|`NaN`|\n|`null`|`0`|\n|<code>true&nbsp;/&nbsp;false</code> | `1 / 0` |\n| `string` | The string is read \"as is\", whitespaces from both sides are ignored. An empty string becomes `0`. An error gives `NaN`. |\n\n**`Boolean Conversion`** -- Occurs in logical operations. Can be performed with `Boolean(value)`.\n\nFollows the rules:\n\n| Value |  Becomes... |\n|-------|-------------|\n|`0`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, `\"\"` |`false`|\n|any other value| `true` |\n\n\nMost of these rules are easy to understand and memorize. The notable exceptions where people usually make mistakes are:\n\n- `undefined` is `NaN` as a number, not `0`.\n- `\"0\"` and space-only strings like `\"   \"` are true as a boolean.\n\nObjects aren't covered here. We'll return to them later in the chapter <info:object-toprimitive> that is devoted exclusively to objects after we learn more basic things about JavaScript.",

They are things like addition `+`, multiplication `*`, subtraction `-`, and so on.\n\nIn this chapter, we’ll start with simple operators, then concentrate on JavaScript-specific aspects, not covered by school arithmetic.\n\n## Terms: \"unary\", \"binary\", \"operand\"\n\nBefore we move on, let's grasp some common terminology.\n\n- *An operand* -- is what operators are applied to. For instance, in the multiplication of `5 * 2` there are two operands: the left operand is `5` and the right operand is `2`. Sometimes, people call these \"arguments\" instead of \"operands\".\n- An operator is *unary* if it has a single operand. For example, the unary negation `-` reverses the sign of a number:\n\n    ```js run\n    let x = 1;\n\n    *!*\n    x = -x;\n    */!*\n    alert( x ); // -1, unary negation was applied\n    ```\n- An operator is *binary* if it has two operands. The same minus exists in binary form as well:\n\n    ```js run no-beautify\n    let x = 1, y = 3;\n    alert( y - x ); // 2, binary minus subtracts values\n    ```\n\n    Formally, in the examples above we have two different operators that share the same symbol: the negation operator, a unary operator that reverses the sign, and the subtraction operator, a binary operator that subtracts one number from another.\n\n## Maths\n\nThe following math operations are supported:\n\n- Addition `+`,\n- Subtraction `-`,\n- Multiplication `*`,\n- Division `/`,\n- Remainder `%`,\n- Exponentiation `**`.\n\nThe first four are straightforward, while `%` and `**` need a few words about them.\n\n### Remainder %\n\nThe remainder operator `%`, despite its appearance, is not related to percents.\n\nThe result of `a % b` is the [remainder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remainder) of the integer division of `a` by `b`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nalert( 5 % 2 ); // 1, a remainder of 5 divided by 2\nalert( 8 % 3 ); // 2, a remainder of 8 divided by 3\n```\n\n### Exponentiation **\n\nThe exponentiation operator `a ** b` multiplies `a` by itself `b` times.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nalert( 2 ** 2 ); // 4  (2 multiplied by itself 2 times)\nalert( 2 ** 3 ); // 8  (2 * 2 * 2, 3 times)\nalert( 2 ** 4 ); // 16 (2 * 2 * 2 * 2, 4 times)\n```\n\nMathematically, the exponentiation is defined for non-integer numbers as well. For example, a square root is an exponentiation by `1/2`:\n\n```js run\nalert( 4 ** (1/2) ); // 2 (power of 1/2 is the same as a square root)\nalert( 8 ** (1/3) ); // 2 (power of 1/3 is the same as a cubic root)\n```\n\n\n## String concatenation with binary +\n\nLet's meet features of JavaScript operators that are beyond school arithmetics.\n\nUsually, the plus operator `+` sums numbers.\n\nBut, if the binary `+` is applied to strings, it merges (concatenates) them:\n\n```js\nlet s = \"my\" + \"string\";\nalert(s); // mystring\n```\n\nNote that if any of the operands is a string, then the other one is converted to a string too.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nalert( '1' + 2 ); // \"12\"\nalert( 2 + '1' ); // \"21\"\n```\n\nSee, it doesn't matter whether the first operand is a string or the second one.\n\nHere's a more complex example:\n\n```js run\nalert(2 + 2 + '1' ); // \"41\" and not \"221\"\n```\n\nHere, operators work one after another. The first `+` sums two numbers, so it returns `4`, then the next `+` adds the string `1` to it, so it's like `4 + '1' = 41`.\n\nThe binary `+` is the only operator that supports strings in such a way. Other arithmetic operators work only with numbers and always convert their operands to numbers.\n\nHere's the demo for subtraction and division:\n\n```js run\nalert( 6 - '2' ); // 4, converts '2' to a number\nalert( '6' / '2' ); // 3, converts both operands to numbers\n```\n\n## Numeric conversion, unary +\n\nThe plus `+` exists in two forms: the binary form that we used above and the unary form.\n\nThe unary plus or, in other words, the plus operator `+` applied to a single value, doesn't do anything to numbers. But if the operand is not a number, the unary plus converts it into a number.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\n// No effect on numbers\nlet x = 1;\nalert( +x ); // 1\n\nlet y = -2;\nalert( +y ); // -2\n\n*!*\n// Converts non-numbers\nalert( +true ); // 1\nalert( +\"\" );   // 0\n*/!*\n```\n\nIt actually does the same thing as `Number(...)`, but is shorter.\n\nThe need to convert strings to numbers arises very often. For example, if we are getting values from HTML form fields, they are usually strings. What if we want to sum them?\n\nThe binary plus would add them as strings:\n\n```js run\nlet apples = \"2\";\nlet oranges = \"3\";\n\nalert( apples + oranges ); // \"23\", the binary plus concatenates strings\n```\n\nIf we want to treat them as numbers, we need to convert and then sum them:\n\n```js run\nlet apples = \"2\";\nlet oranges = \"3\";\n\n*!*\n// both values converted to numbers before the binary plus\nalert( +apples + +oranges ); // 5\n*/!*\n\n// the longer variant\n// alert( Number(apples) + Number(oranges) ); // 5\n```\n\nFrom a mathematician's standpoint, the abundance of pluses may seem strange. But from a programmer's standpoint, there's nothing special: unary pluses are applied first, they convert strings to numbers, and then the binary plus sums them up.\n\nWhy are unary pluses applied to values before the binary ones? As we're going to see, that's because of their *higher precedence*.\n\n## Operator precedence\n\nIf an expression has more than one operator, the execution order is defined by their *precedence*, or, in other words, the default priority order of operators.\n\nFrom school, we all know that the multiplication in the expression `1 + 2 * 2` should be calculated before the addition. That's exactly the precedence thing. The multiplication is said to have *a higher precedence* than the addition.\n\nParentheses override any precedence, so if we're not satisfied with the default order, we can use them to change it. For example, write `(1 + 2) * 2`.\n\nThere are many operators in JavaScript. Every operator has a corresponding precedence number. The one with the larger number executes first. If the precedence is the same, the execution order is from left to right.\n\nHere's an extract from the [precedence table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/operators/operator_precedence) (you don't need to remember this, but note that unary operators are higher than corresponding binary ones):\n\n| Precedence | Name | Sign |\n|------------|------|------|\n| ... | ... | ... |\n| 17 | unary plus | `+` |\n| 17 | unary negation | `-` |\n| 16 | exponentiation | `**` |\n| 15 | multiplication | `*` |\n| 15 | division | `/` |\n| 13 | addition | `+` |\n| 13 | subtraction | `-` |\n| ... | ... | ... |\n| 3 | assignment | `=` |\n| ... | ... | ... |\n\nAs we can see, the \"unary plus\" has a priority of `17` which is higher than the `13` of \"addition\" (binary plus). That's why, in the expression `\"+apples + +oranges\"`, unary pluses work before the addition.\n\n## Assignment\n\nLet's note that an assignment `=` is also an operator. It is listed in the precedence table with the very low priority of `3`.\n\nThat's why, when we assign a variable, like `x = 2 * 2 + 1`, the calculations are done first and then the `=` is evaluated, storing the result in `x`.\n\n```js\nlet x = 2 * 2 + 1;\n\nalert( x ); // 5\n```\n\n### Assignment = returns a value\n\nThe fact of `=` being an operator, not a \"magical\" language construct has an interesting implication.\n\nMost operators in JavaScript return a value. That's obvious for `+` and `-`, but also true for `=`.\n\nThe call `x = value` writes the `value` into `x` *and then returns it*.\n\nHere's a demo that uses an assignment as part of a more complex expression:\n\n```js run\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\n\n*!*\nlet c = 3 - (a = b + 1);\n*/!*\n\nalert( a ); // 3\nalert( c ); // 0\n```\n\nIn the example above, the result of expression `(a = b + 1)` is the value which was assigned to `a` (that is `3`). It is then used for further evaluations.\n\nFunny code, isn't it? We should understand how it works, because sometimes we see it in JavaScript libraries.\n\nAlthough, please don't write the code like that. Such tricks definitely don't make code clearer or readable.\n\n### Chaining assignments\n\nAnother interesting feature is the ability to chain assignments:\n\n```js run\nlet a, b, c;\n\n*!*\na = b = c = 2 + 2;\n*/!*\n\nalert( a ); // 4\nalert( b ); // 4\nalert( c ); // 4\n```\n\nChained assignments evaluate from right to left. First, the rightmost expression `2 + 2` is evaluated and then assigned to the variables on the left: `c`, `b` and `a`. At the end, all the variables share a single value.\n\nOnce again, for the purposes of readability it's better to split such code into few lines:\n\n```js\nc = 2 + 2;\nb = c;\na = c;\n```\nThat's easier to read, especially when eye-scanning the code fast.\n\n## Modify-in-place\n\nWe often need to apply an operator to a variable and store the new result in that same variable.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nlet n = 2;\nn = n + 5;\nn = n * 2;\n```\n\nThis notation can be shortened using the operators `+=` and `*=`:\n\n```js run\nlet n = 2;\nn += 5; // now n = 7 (same as n = n + 5)\nn *= 2; // now n = 14 (same as n = n * 2)\n\nalert( n ); // 14\n```\n\nShort \"modify-and-assign\" operators exist for all arithmetical and bitwise operators: `/=`, `-=`, etc.\n\nSuch operators have the same precedence as a normal assignment, so they run after most other calculations:\n\n```js run\nlet n = 2;\n\nn *= 3 + 5;\n\nalert( n ); // 16  (right part evaluated first, same as n *= 8)\n```\n\n## Increment/decrement\n\n<!-- Can't use -- in title, because the built-in parser turns it into a 'long dash' – -->\n\nIncreasing or decreasing a number by one is among the most common numerical operations.\n\nSo, there are special operators for it:\n\n- **Increment** `++` increases a variable by 1:\n\n    ```js run no-beautify\n    let counter = 2;\n    counter++;        // works the same as counter = counter + 1, but is shorter\n    alert( counter ); // 3\n    ```\n- **Decrement** `--` decreases a variable by 1:\n\n    ```js run no-beautify\n    let counter = 2;\n    counter--;        // works the same as counter = counter - 1, but is shorter\n    alert( counter ); // 1\n    ```\n\n```warn\nIncrement/decrement can only be applied to variables. Trying to use it on a value like `5++` will give an error.\n```\n\nThe operators `++` and `--` can be placed either before or after a variable.\n\n- When the operator goes after the variable, it is in \"postfix form\": `counter++`.\n- The \"prefix form\" is when the operator goes before the variable: `++counter`.\n\nBoth of these statements do the same thing: increase `counter` by `1`.\n\nIs there any difference? Yes, but we can only see it if we use the returned value of `++/--`.\n\nLet's clarify. As we know, all operators return a value. Increment/decrement is no exception. The prefix form returns the new value while the postfix form returns the old value (prior to increment/decrement).\n\nTo see the difference, here's an example:\n\n```js run\nlet counter = 1;\nlet a = ++counter; // (*)\n\nalert(a); // *!*2*/!*\n```\n\nIn the line `(*)`, the *prefix* form `++counter` increments `counter` and returns the new value, `2`. So, the `alert` shows `2`.\n\nNow, let's use the postfix form:\n\n```js run\nlet counter = 1;\nlet a = counter++; // (*) changed ++counter to counter++\n\nalert(a); // *!*1*/!*\n```\n\nIn the line `(*)`, the *postfix* form `counter++` also increments `counter` but returns the *old* value (prior to increment). So, the `alert` shows `1`.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- If the result of increment/decrement is not used, there is no difference in which form to use:\n\n    ```js run\n    let counter = 0;\n    counter++;\n    ++counter;\n    alert( counter ); // 2, the lines above did the same\n    ```\n- If we'd like to increase a value *and* immediately use the result of the operator, we need the prefix form:\n\n    ```js run\n    let counter = 0;\n    alert( ++counter ); // 1\n    ```\n- If we'd like to increment a value but use its previous value, we need the postfix form:\n\n    ```js run\n    let counter = 0;\n    alert( counter++ ); // 0\n    ```\n\n````smart header=\"Increment/decrement among other operators\"\nThe operators `++/--` can be used inside expressions as well. Their precedence is higher than most other arithmetical operations.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet counter = 1;\nalert( 2 * ++counter ); // 4\n```\n\nCompare with:\n\n```js run\nlet counter = 1;\nalert( 2 * counter++ ); // 2, because counter++ returns the \"old\" value\n```\n\nThough technically okay, such notation usually makes code less readable. One line does multiple things -- not good.\n\nWhile reading code, a fast \"vertical\" eye-scan can easily miss something like `counter++` and it won't be obvious that the variable increased.\n\nWe advise a style of \"one line -- one action\":\n\n```js run\nlet counter = 1;\nalert( 2 * counter );\ncounter++;\n```\n````\n\n## Bitwise operators\n\nBitwise operators treat arguments as 32-bit integer numbers and work on the level of their binary representation.\n\nThese operators are not JavaScript-specific. They are supported in most programming languages.\n\nThe list of operators:\n\n- AND ( `&` )\n- OR ( `|` )\n- XOR ( `^` )\n- NOT ( `~` )\n- LEFT SHIFT ( `<<` )\n- RIGHT SHIFT ( `>>` )\n- ZERO-FILL RIGHT SHIFT ( `>>>` )\n\nThese operators are used very rarely, when we need to fiddle with numbers on the very lowest (bitwise) level. We won't need these operators any time soon, as web development has little use of them, but in some special areas, such as cryptography, they are useful. You can read the [Bitwise Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators) article on MDN when a need arises.\n\n## Comma\n\nThe comma operator `,` is one of the rarest and most unusual operators. Sometimes, it's used to write shorter code, so we need to know it in order to understand what's going on.\n\nThe comma operator allows us to evaluate several expressions, dividing them with a comma `,`. Each of them is evaluated but only the result of the last one is returned.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\n*!*\nlet a = (1 + 2, 3 + 4);\n*/!*\n\nalert( a ); // 7 (the result of 3 + 4)\n```\n\nHere, the first expression `1 + 2` is evaluated and its result is thrown away. Then, `3 + 4` is evaluated and returned as the result.\n\n```smart header=\"Comma has a very low precedence\"\nPlease note that the comma operator has very low precedence, lower than `=`, so parentheses are important in the example above.\n\nWithout them: `a = 1 + 2, 3 + 4` evaluates `+` first, summing the numbers into `a = 3, 7`, then the assignment operator `=` assigns `a = 3`, and the rest is ignored. It's like `(a = 1 + 2), 3 + 4`.\n```\n\nWhy do we need an operator that throws away everything except the last expression?\n\nSometimes, people use it in more complex constructs to put several actions in one line.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\n// three operations in one line\nfor (*!*a = 1, b = 3, c = a * b*/!*; a < 10; a++) {\n ...\n}\n```\n\nSuch tricks are used in many JavaScript frameworks. That's why we're mentioning them. But usually they don't improve code readability so we should think well before using them.",

In maths the notation is <code>&ne;</code>, but in JavaScript it's written as <code>a != b</code>.\n\nIn this article we'll learn more about different types of comparisons, how JavaScript makes them, including important peculiarities.\n\n## Boolean is the result\n\nAll comparison operators return a boolean value:\n\n- `true` -- means \"yes\", \"correct\" or \"the truth\".\n- `false` -- means \"no\", \"wrong\" or \"not the truth\".\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nalert( 2 > 1 );  // true (correct)\nalert( 2 == 1 ); // false (wrong)\nalert( 2 != 1 ); // true (correct)\n```\n\nA comparison result can be assigned to a variable, just like any value:\n\n```js run\nlet result = 5 > 4; // assign the result of the comparison\nalert( result ); // true\n```\n\n## String comparison\n\nTo see whether a string is greater than another, JavaScript uses the so-called \"dictionary\" or \"lexicographical\" order.\n\nIn other words, strings are compared letter-by-letter.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nalert( 'Z' > 'A' ); // true\nalert( 'Glow' > 'Glee' ); // true\nalert( 'Bee' > 'Be' ); // true\n```\n\nThe algorithm to compare two strings is simple:\n\n1. Compare the first character of both strings.\n2. If the first character from the first string is greater (or less) than the other string's, then the first string is greater (or less) than the second. We're done.\n3. Otherwise, if both strings' first characters are the same, compare the second characters the same way.\n4. Repeat until the end of either string.\n5. If both strings end at the same length, then they are equal. Otherwise, the longer string is greater.\n\nIn the examples above, the comparison `'Z' > 'A'` gets to a result at the first step while the strings `\"Glow\"` and `\"Glee\"` are compared character-by-character:\n\n1. `G` is the same as `G`.\n2. `l` is the same as `l`.\n3. `o` is greater than `e`. Stop here. The first string is greater.\n\n```smart header=\"Not a real dictionary, but Unicode order\"\nThe comparison algorithm given above is roughly equivalent to the one used in dictionaries or phone books, but it's not exactly the same.\n\nFor instance, case matters. A capital letter `\"A\"` is not equal to the lowercase `\"a\"`. Which one is greater? The lowercase `\"a\"`. Why? Because the lowercase character has a greater index in the internal encoding table JavaScript uses (Unicode). We'll get back to specific details and consequences of this in the chapter <info:string>.\n```\n\n## Comparison of different types\n\nWhen comparing values of different types, JavaScript converts the values to numbers.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nalert( '2' > 1 ); // true, string '2' becomes a number 2\nalert( '01' == 1 ); // true, string '01' becomes a number 1\n```\n\nFor boolean values, `true` becomes `1` and `false` becomes `0`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nalert( true == 1 ); // true\nalert( false == 0 ); // true\n```\n\n````smart header=\"A funny consequence\"\nIt is possible that at the same time:\n\n- Two values are equal.\n- One of them is `true` as a boolean and the other one is `false` as a boolean.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nlet a = 0;\nalert( Boolean(a) ); // false\n\nlet b = \"0\";\nalert( Boolean(b) ); // true\n\nalert(a == b); // true!\n```\n\nFrom JavaScript's standpoint, this result is quite normal. An equality check converts values using the numeric conversion (hence `\"0\"` becomes `0`), while the explicit `Boolean` conversion uses another set of rules.\n````\n\n## Strict equality\n\nA regular equality check `==` has a problem. It cannot differentiate `0` from `false`:\n\n```js run\nalert( 0 == false ); // true\n```\n\nThe same thing happens with an empty string:\n\n```js run\nalert( '' == false ); // true\n```\n\nThis happens because operands of different types are converted to numbers by the equality operator `==`. An empty string, just like `false`, becomes a zero.\n\nWhat to do if we'd like to differentiate `0` from `false`?\n\n**A strict equality operator `===` checks the equality without type conversion.**\n\nIn other words, if `a` and `b` are of different types, then `a === b` immediately returns `false` without an attempt to convert them.\n\nLet's try it:\n\n```js run\nalert( 0 === false ); // false, because the types are different\n```\n\nThere is also a \"strict non-equality\" operator `!==` analogous to `!=`.\n\nThe strict equality operator is a bit longer to write, but makes it obvious what's going on and leaves less room for errors.\n\n## Comparison with null and undefined\n\nThere's a non-intuitive behavior when `null` or `undefined` are compared to other values.\n\nFor a strict equality check `===`\n: These values are different, because each of them is a different type.\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( null === undefined ); // false\n    ```\n\nFor a non-strict check `==`\n: There's a special rule. These two are a \"sweet couple\": they equal each other (in the sense of `==`), but not any other value.\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( null == undefined ); // true\n    ```\n\nFor maths and other comparisons `< > <= >=`\n: `null/undefined` are converted to numbers: `null` becomes `0`, while `undefined` becomes `NaN`.\n\nNow let's see some funny things that happen when we apply these rules. And, what's more important, how to not fall into a trap with them.\n\n### Strange result: null vs 0\n\nLet's compare `null` with a zero:\n\n```js run\nalert( null > 0 );  // (1) false\nalert( null == 0 ); // (2) false\nalert( null >= 0 ); // (3) *!*true*/!*\n```\n\nMathematically, that's strange. The last result states that \"`null` is greater than or equal to zero\", so in one of the comparisons above it must be `true`, but they are both false.\n\nThe reason is that an equality check `==` and comparisons `> < >= <=` work differently. Comparisons convert `null` to a number, treating it as `0`. That's why (3) `null >= 0` is true and (1) `null > 0` is false.\n\nOn the other hand, the equality check `==` for `undefined` and `null` is defined such that, without any conversions, they equal each other and don't equal anything else. That's why (2) `null == 0` is false.\n\n### An incomparable undefined\n\nThe value `undefined` shouldn't be compared to other values:\n\n```js run\nalert( undefined > 0 ); // false (1)\nalert( undefined < 0 ); // false (2)\nalert( undefined == 0 ); // false (3)\n```\n\nWhy does it dislike zero so much? Always false!\n\nWe get these results because:\n\n- Comparisons `(1)` and `(2)` return `false` because `undefined` gets converted to `NaN` and `NaN` is a special numeric value which returns `false` for all comparisons.\n- The equality check `(3)` returns `false` because `undefined` only equals `null`, `undefined`, and no other value.\n\n### Evade problems\n\nWhy did we go over these examples? Should we remember these peculiarities all the time? Well, not really. Actually, these tricky things will gradually become familiar over time, but there's a solid way to evade problems with them:\n\nJust treat any comparison with `undefined/null` except the strict equality `===` with exceptional care.\n\nDon't use comparisons `>= > < <=` with a variable which may be `null/undefined`, unless you're really sure of what you're doing. If a variable can have these values, check for them separately.\n\n## Summary\n\n- Comparison operators return a boolean value.\n- Strings are compared letter-by-letter in the \"dictionary\" order.\n- When values of different types are compared, they get converted to numbers (with the exclusion of a strict equality check).\n- The values `null` and `undefined` equal `==` each other and do not equal any other value.\n- Be careful when using comparisons like `>` or `<` with variables that can occasionally be `null/undefined`. Checking for `null/undefined` separately is a good idea.",

        "content": "\n\nSometimes, we need to perform different actions based on different conditions.\n\nTo do that, we can use the `if` statement and the conditional operator `?`, that's also called a \"question mark\" operator.\n\n## The \"if\" statement\n\nThe `if(...)` statement evaluates a condition in parentheses and, if the result is `true`, executes a block of code.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nlet year = prompt('In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');\n\n*!*\nif (year == 2015) alert( 'You are right!' );\n*/!*\n```\n\nIn the example above, the condition is a simple equality check (`year == 2015`), but it can be much more complex.\n\nIf we want to execute more than one statement, we have to wrap our code block inside curly braces:\n\n```js\nif (year == 2015) {\n  alert( \"That's correct!\" );\n  alert( \"You're so smart!\" );\n}\n```\n\nWe recommend wrapping your code block with curly braces `{}` every time you use an `if` statement, even if there is only one statement to execute. Doing so improves readability.\n\n## Boolean conversion\n\nThe `if (…)` statement evaluates the expression in its parentheses and converts the result to a boolean.\n\nLet's recall the conversion rules from the chapter <info:type-conversions>:\n\n- A number `0`, an empty string `\"\"`, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN` all become `false`. Because of that they are called \"falsy\" values.\n- Other values become `true`, so they are called \"truthy\".\n\nSo, the code under this condition would never execute:\n\n```js\nif (0) { // 0 is falsy\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n...and inside this condition -- it always will:\n\n```js\nif (1) { // 1 is truthy\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nWe can also pass a pre-evaluated boolean value to `if`, like this:\n\n```js\nlet cond = (year == 2015); // equality evaluates to true or false\n\nif (cond) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n## The \"else\" clause\n\nThe `if` statement may contain an optional \"else\" block. It executes when the condition is false.\n\nFor example:\n```js run\nlet year = prompt('In which year was the ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');\n\nif (year == 2015) {\n  alert( 'You guessed it right!' );\n} else {\n  alert( 'How can you be so wrong?' ); // any value except 2015\n}\n```\n\n## Several conditions: \"else if\"\n\nSometimes, we'd like to test several variants of a condition. The `else if` clause lets us do that.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nlet year = prompt('In which year was the ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');\n\nif (year < 2015) {\n  alert( 'Too early...' );\n} else if (year > 2015) {\n  alert( 'Too late' );\n} else {\n  alert( 'Exactly!' );\n}\n```\n\nIn the code above, JavaScript first checks `year < 2015`. If that is falsy, it goes to the next condition `year > 2015`. If that is also falsy, it shows the last `alert`.\n\nThere can be more `else if` blocks. The final `else` is optional.\n\n## Conditional operator '?'\n\nSometimes, we need to assign a variable depending on a condition.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nlet accessAllowed;\nlet age = prompt('How old are you?', '');\n\n*!*\nif (age > 18) {\n  accessAllowed = true;\n} else {\n  accessAllowed = false;\n}\n*/!*\n\nalert(accessAllowed);\n```\n\nThe so-called \"conditional\" or \"question mark\" operator lets us do that in a shorter and simpler way.\n\nThe operator is represented by a question mark `?`. Sometimes it's called \"ternary\", because the operator has three operands. It is actually the one and only operator in JavaScript which has that many.\n\nThe syntax is:\n```js\nlet result = condition ? value1 : value2;\n```\n\nThe `condition` is evaluated: if it's truthy then `value1` is returned, otherwise -- `value2`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nlet accessAllowed = (age > 18) ? true : false;\n```\n\nTechnically, we can omit the parentheses around `age > 18`. The question mark operator has a low precedence, so it executes after the comparison `>`.\n\nThis example will do the same thing as the previous one:\n\n```js\n// the comparison operator \"age > 18\" executes first anyway\n// (no need to wrap it into parentheses)\nlet accessAllowed = age > 18 ? true : false;\n```\n\nBut parentheses make the code more readable, so we recommend using them.\n\n````smart\nIn the example above, you can avoid using the question mark operator because the comparison itself returns `true/false`:\n\n```js\n// the same\nlet accessAllowed = age > 18;\n```\n````\n\n## Multiple '?'\n\nA sequence of question mark operators `?` can return a value that depends on more than one condition.\n\nFor instance:\n```js run\nlet age = prompt('age?', 18);\n\nlet message = (age < 3) ? 'Hi, baby!' :\n  (age < 18) ? 'Hello!' :\n  (age < 100) ? 'Greetings!' :\n  'What an unusual age!';\n\nalert( message );\n```\n\nIt may be difficult at first to grasp what's going on. But after a closer look, we can see that it's just an ordinary sequence of tests:\n\n1. The first question mark checks whether `age < 3`.\n2. If true -- it returns `'Hi, baby!'`. Otherwise, it continues to the expression after the colon '\":\"', checking `age < 18`.\n3. If that's true -- it returns `'Hello!'`. Otherwise, it continues to the expression after the next colon '\":\"', checking `age < 100`.\n4. If that's true -- it returns `'Greetings!'`. Otherwise, it continues to the expression after the last colon '\":\"', returning `'What an unusual age!'`.\n\nHere's how this looks using `if..else`:\n\n```js\nif (age < 3) {\n  message = 'Hi, baby!';\n} else if (age < 18) {\n  message = 'Hello!';\n} else if (age < 100) {\n  message = 'Greetings!';\n} else {\n  message = 'What an unusual age!';\n}\n```\n\n## Non-traditional use of '?'\n\nSometimes the question mark `?` is used as a replacement for `if`:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nlet company = prompt('Which company created JavaScript?', '');\n\n*!*\n(company == 'Netscape') ?\n   alert('Right!') : alert('Wrong.');\n*/!*\n```\n\nDepending on the condition `company == 'Netscape'`, either the first or the second expression after the `?` gets executed and shows an alert.\n\nWe don't assign a result to a variable here. Instead, we execute different code depending on the condition.\n\n**It's not recommended to use the question mark operator in this way.**\n\nThe notation is shorter than the equivalent `if` statement, which appeals to some programmers. But it is less readable.\n\nHere is the same code using `if` for comparison:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nlet company = prompt('Which company created JavaScript?', '');\n\n*!*\nif (company == 'Netscape') {\n  alert('Right!');\n} else {\n  alert('Wrong.');\n}\n*/!*\n```\n\nOur eyes scan the code vertically. Code blocks which span several lines are easier to understand than a long, horizontal instruction set.\n\nThe purpose of the question mark operator `?` is to return one value or another depending on its condition. Please use it for exactly that. Use `if` when you need to execute different branches of code.",

        "content": "\n\nThere are three logical operators in JavaScript: `||` (OR), `&&` (AND), `!` (NOT).\n\nAlthough they are called \"logical\", they can be applied to values of any type, not only boolean. Their result can also be of any type.\n\nLet's see the details.\n\n## || (OR)\n\nThe \"OR\" operator is represented with two vertical line symbols:\n\n```js\nresult = a || b;\n```\n\nIn classical programming, the logical OR is meant to manipulate boolean values only. If any of its arguments are `true`, it returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.\n\nIn JavaScript, the operator is a little bit trickier and more powerful. But first, let's see what happens with boolean values.\n\nThere are four possible logical combinations:\n\n```js run\nalert( true || true );   // true\nalert( false || true );  // true\nalert( true || false );  // true\nalert( false || false ); // false\n```\n\nAs we can see, the result is always `true` except for the case when both operands are `false`.\n\nIf an operand is not a boolean, it's converted to a boolean for the evaluation.\n\nFor instance, the number `1` is treated as `true`, the number `0` as `false`:\n\n```js run\nif (1 || 0) { // works just like if( true || false )\n  alert( 'truthy!' );\n}\n```\n\nMost of the time, OR `||` is used in an `if` statement to test if *any* of the given conditions is `true`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nlet hour = 9;\n\n*!*\nif (hour < 10 || hour > 18) {\n*/!*\n  alert( 'The office is closed.' );\n}\n```\n\nWe can pass more conditions:\n\n```js run\nlet hour = 12;\nlet isWeekend = true;\n\nif (hour < 10 || hour > 18 || isWeekend) {\n  alert( 'The office is closed.' ); // it is the weekend\n}\n```\n\n## OR \"||\" finds the first truthy value\n\nThe logic described above is somewhat classical. Now, let's bring in the \"extra\" features of JavaScript.\n\nThe extended algorithm works as follows.\n\nGiven multiple OR'ed values:\n\n```js\nresult = value1 || value2 || value3;\n```\n\nThe OR `||` operator does the following:\n\n- Evaluates operands from left to right.\n- For each operand, converts it to boolean. If the result is `true`, stops and returns the original value of that operand.\n- If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were `false`), returns the last operand.\n\nA value is returned in its original form, without the conversion.\n\nIn other words, a chain of OR `\"||\"` returns the first truthy value or the last one if no truthy value is found.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nalert( 1 || 0 ); // 1 (1 is truthy)\n\nalert( null || 1 ); // 1 (1 is the first truthy value)\nalert( null || 0 || 1 ); // 1 (the first truthy value)\n\nalert( undefined || null || 0 ); // 0 (all falsy, returns the last value)\n```\n\nThis leads to some interesting usage compared to a \"pure, classical, boolean-only OR\".\n\n1. **Getting the first truthy value from a list of variables or expressions.**\n\n    For instance, we have `firstName`, `lastName` and `nickName` variables, all optional.\n\n    Let's use OR `||` to choose the one that has the data and show it (or `anonymous` if nothing set):\n\n    ```js run\n    let firstName = \"\";\n    let lastName = \"\";\n    let nickName = \"SuperCoder\";\n\n    *!*\n    alert( firstName || lastName || nickName || \"Anonymous\"); // SuperCoder\n    */!*\n    ```\n\n    If all variables were falsy, `Anonymous` would show up.\n\n2. **Short-circuit evaluation.**\n\n    Another feature of OR `||` operator is the so-called \"short-circuit\" evaluation.\n\n    It means that `||` processes its arguments until the first truthy value is reached, and then the value is returned immediately, without even touching the other argument.\n\n    That importance of this feature becomes obvious if an operand isn't just a value, but an expression with a side effect, such as a variable assignment or a function call.\n\n    In the example below, only the second message is printed:\n\n    ```js run no-beautify\n    *!*true*/!* || alert(\"not printed\");\n    *!*false*/!* || alert(\"printed\");\n    ```\n\n    In the first line, the OR `||` operator stops the evaluation immediately upon seeing `true`, so the `alert` isn't run.\n\n    Sometimes, people use this feature to execute commands only if the condition on the left part is falsy.\n\n## && (AND)\n\nThe AND operator is represented with two ampersands `&&`:\n\n```js\nresult = a && b;\n```\n\nIn classical programming, AND returns `true` if both operands are truthy and `false` otherwise:\n\n```js run\nalert( true && true );   // true\nalert( false && true );  // false\nalert( true && false );  // false\nalert( false && false ); // false\n```\n\nAn example with `if`:\n\n```js run\nlet hour = 12;\nlet minute = 30;\n\nif (hour == 12 && minute == 30) {\n  alert( 'The time is 12:30' );\n}\n```\n\nJust as with OR, any value is allowed as an operand of AND:\n\n```js run\nif (1 && 0) { // evaluated as true && false\n  alert( \"won't work, because the result is falsy\" );\n}\n```\n\n\n## AND \"&&\" finds the first falsy value\n\nGiven multiple AND'ed values:\n\n```js\nresult = value1 && value2 && value3;\n```\n\nThe AND `&&` operator does the following:\n\n- Evaluates operands from left to right.\n- For each operand, converts it to a boolean. If the result is `false`, stops and returns the original value of that operand.\n- If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were truthy), returns the last operand.\n\nIn other words, AND returns the first falsy value or the last value if none were found.\n\nThe rules above are similar to OR. The difference is that AND returns the first *falsy* value while OR returns the first *truthy* one.\n\nExamples:\n\n```js run\n// if the first operand is truthy,\n// AND returns the second operand:\nalert( 1 && 0 ); // 0\nalert( 1 && 5 ); // 5\n\n// if the first operand is falsy,\n// AND returns it. The second operand is ignored\nalert( null && 5 ); // null\nalert( 0 && \"no matter what\" ); // 0\n```\n\nWe can also pass several values in a row. See how the first falsy one is returned:\n\n```js run\nalert( 1 && 2 && null && 3 ); // null\n```\n\nWhen all values are truthy, the last value is returned:\n\n```js run\nalert( 1 && 2 && 3 ); // 3, the last one\n```\n\n````smart header=\"Precedence of AND `&&` is higher than OR `||`\"\nThe precedence of AND `&&` operator is higher than OR `||`.\n\nSo the code `a && b || c && d` is essentially the same as if the `&&` expressions were in parentheses: `(a && b) || (c && d)`.\n````\n\n````warn header=\"Don't replace `if` with || or &&\"\nSometimes, people use the AND `&&` operator as a \"shorter to write `if`\".\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet x = 1;\n\n(x > 0) && alert( 'Greater than zero!' );\n```\n\nThe action in the right part of `&&` would execute only if the evaluation reaches it. That is, only if `(x > 0)` is true.\n\nSo we basically have an analogue for:\n\n```js run\nlet x = 1;\n\nif (x > 0) alert( 'Greater than zero!' );\n```\n\nAlthough, the variant with `&&` appears shorter, `if` is more obvious and tends to be a little bit more readable. So we recommend using every construct for its purpose: use `if` if we want if and use `&&` if we want AND.\n````\n\n\n## ! (NOT)\n\nThe boolean NOT operator is represented with an exclamation sign `!`.\n\nThe syntax is pretty simple:\n\n```js\nresult = !value;\n```\n\nThe operator accepts a single argument and does the following:\n\n1. Converts the operand to boolean type: `true/false`.\n2. Returns the inverse value.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nalert( !true ); // false\nalert( !0 ); // true\n```\n\nA double NOT `!!` is sometimes used for converting a value to boolean type:\n\n```js run\nalert( !!\"non-empty string\" ); // true\nalert( !!null ); // false\n```\n\nThat is, the first NOT converts the value to boolean and returns the inverse, and the second NOT inverses it again. In the end, we have a plain value-to-boolean conversion.\n\nThere's a little more verbose way to do the same thing -- a built-in `Boolean` function:\n\n```js run\nalert( Boolean(\"non-empty string\") ); // true\nalert( Boolean(null) ); // false\n```\n\nThe precedence of NOT `!` is the highest of all logical operators, so it always executes first, before `&&` or `||`.",

        "content": "\n\n[recent browser=\"new\"]\n\nThe nullish coalescing operator `??` provides a short syntax for selecting a first \"defined\" variable from the list.\n\nThe result of `a ?? b` is:\n- `a` if it's not `null` or `undefined`,\n- `b`, otherwise.\n\nSo, `x = a ?? b` is a short equivalent to:\n\n```js\nx = (a !== null && a !== undefined) ? a : b;\n```\n\nHere's a longer example.\n\nImagine, we have a user, and there are variables `firstName`, `lastName` or `nickName` for their first name, last name and the nick name. All of them may be undefined, if the user decided not to enter any value.\n\nWe'd like to display the user name: one of these three variables, or show \"Anonymous\" if nothing is set.\n\nLet's use the `??` operator to select the first defined one:\n\n```js run\nlet firstName = null;\nlet lastName = null;\nlet nickName = \"Supercoder\";\n\n// show the first not-null/undefined value\n*!*\nalert(firstName ?? lastName ?? nickName ?? \"Anonymous\"); // Supercoder\n*/!*\n```\n\n## Comparison with ||\n\nThe OR `||` operator can be used in the same way as `??`. Actually, we can replace `??` with `||` in the code above and get the same result, as it was described in the [previous chapter](info:logical-operators#or-finds-the-first-truthy-value).\n\nThe important difference is that:\n- `||` returns the first *truthy* value.\n- `??` returns the first *defined* value.\n\nThis matters a lot when we'd like to treat `null/undefined` differently from `0`.\n\nFor example, consider this:\n\n```js\nheight = height ?? 100;\n```\n\nThis sets `height` to `100` if it's not defined.\n\nLet's compare it with `||`:\n\n```js run\nlet height = 0;\n\nalert(height || 100); // 100\nalert(height ?? 100); // 0\n```\n\nHere, `height || 100` treats zero height as unset, same as `null`, `undefined` or any other falsy value. So the result is `100`.\n\nThe `height ?? 100` returns `100` only if `height` is exactly `null` or `undefined`. So the `alert` shows the height value `0` \"as is\".\n\nWhich behavior is better depends on a particular use case. When zero height is a valid value, then `??` is preferrable.\n\n## Precedence\n\nThe precedence of the `??` operator is rather low: `7` in the [MDN table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#Table).\n\nSo `??` is evaluated after most other operations, but before `=` and `?`.\n\nIf we need to choose a value with `??` in a complex expression, then consider adding parentheses:\n\n```js run\nlet height = null;\nlet width = null;\n\n// important: use parentheses\nlet area = (height ?? 100) * (width ?? 50);\n\nalert(area); // 5000\n```\n\nOtherwise, if we omit parentheses, `*` has the higher precedence than `??` and would run first.\n\nThat would work be the same as:\n\n```js\n// probably not correct\nlet area = height ?? (100 * width) ?? 50;\n```\n\nThere's also a related language-level limitation.\n\n**Due to safety reasons, it's forbidden to use `??` together with `&&` and `||` operators.**\n\nThe code below triggers a syntax error:\n\n```js run\nlet x = 1 && 2 ?? 3; // Syntax error\n```\n\nThe limitation is surely debatable, but it was added to the language specification with the purpose to avoid programming mistakes, as people start to switch to `??` from `||`.\n\nUse explicit parentheses to work around it:\n\n```js run\n*!*\nlet x = (1 && 2) ?? 3; // Works\n*/!*\n\nalert(x); // 2\n```\n\n## Summary\n\n- The nullish coalescing operator `??` provides a short way to choose a \"defined\" value from the list.\n\n    It's used to assign default values to variables:\n\n    ```js\n    // set height=100, if height is null or undefined\n    height = height ?? 100;\n    ```\n\n- The operator `??` has a very low precedence, a bit higher than `?` and `=`.\n- It's forbidden to use it with `||` or `&&` without explicit parentheses.",

In practice, the browser provides ways to stop such loops, and in server-side JavaScript, we can kill the process.\n\nAny expression or variable can be a loop condition, not just comparisons: the condition is evaluated and converted to a boolean by `while`.\n\nFor instance, a shorter way to write `while (i != 0)` is `while (i)`:\n\n```js run\nlet i = 3;\n*!*\nwhile (i) { // when i becomes 0, the condition becomes falsy, and the loop stops\n*/!*\n  alert( i );\n  i--;\n}\n```\n\n````smart header=\"Curly braces are not required for a single-line body\"\nIf the loop body has a single statement, we can omit the curly braces `{…}`:\n\n```js run\nlet i = 3;\n*!*\nwhile (i) alert(i--);\n*/!*\n```\n````\n\n## The \"do..while\" loop\n\nThe condition check can be moved *below* the loop body using the `do..while` syntax:\n\n```js\ndo {\n  // loop body\n} while (condition);\n```\n\nThe loop will first execute the body, then check the condition, and, while it's truthy, execute it again and again.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nlet i = 0;\ndo {\n  alert( i );\n  i++;\n} while (i < 3);\n```\n\nThis form of syntax should only be used when you want the body of the loop to execute **at least once** regardless of the condition being truthy. Usually, the other form is preferred: `while(…) {…}`.\n\n## The \"for\" loop\n\nThe `for` loop is more complex, but it's also the most commonly used loop.\n\nIt looks like this:\n\n```js\nfor (begin; condition; step) {\n  // ... loop body ...\n}\n```\n\nLet's learn the meaning of these parts by example. The loop below runs `alert(i)` for `i` from `0` up to (but not including) `3`:\n\n```js run\nfor (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { // shows 0, then 1, then 2\n  alert(i);\n}\n```\n\nLet's examine the `for` statement part-by-part:\n\n| part  |          |                                                                            |\n|-------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| begin | `i = 0`    | Executes once upon entering the loop.                                      |\n| condition | `i < 3`| Checked before every loop iteration. If false, the loop stops.              |\n| body | `alert(i)`| Runs again and again while the condition is truthy.                         |\n| step| `i++`      | Executes after the body on each iteration. |\n\nThe general loop algorithm works like this:\n\n```\nRun begin\n→ (if condition → run body and run step)\n→ (if condition → run body and run step)\n→ (if condition → run body and run step)\n→ ...\n```\n\nThat is, `begin` executes once, and then it iterates: after each `condition` test, `body` and `step` are executed.\n\nIf you are new to loops, it could help to go back to the example and reproduce how it runs step-by-step on a piece of paper.\n\nHere's exactly what happens in our case:\n\n```js\n// for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) alert(i)\n\n// run begin\nlet i = 0\n// if condition → run body and run step\nif (i < 3) { alert(i); i++ }\n// if condition → run body and run step\nif (i < 3) { alert(i); i++ }\n// if condition → run body and run step\nif (i < 3) { alert(i); i++ }\n// ...finish, because now i == 3\n```\n\n````smart header=\"Inline variable declaration\"\nHere, the \"counter\" variable `i` is declared right in the loop. This is called an \"inline\" variable declaration. Such variables are visible only inside the loop.\n\n```js run\nfor (*!*let*/!* i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n  alert(i); // 0, 1, 2\n}\nalert(i); // error, no such variable\n```\n\nInstead of defining a variable, we could use an existing one:\n\n```js run\nlet i = 0;\n\nfor (i = 0; i < 3; i++) { // use an existing variable\n  alert(i); // 0, 1, 2\n}\n\nalert(i); // 3, visible, because declared outside of the loop\n```\n\n````\n\n\n### Skipping parts\n\nAny part of `for` can be skipped.\n\nFor example, we can omit `begin` if we don't need to do anything at the loop start.\n\nLike here:\n\n```js run\nlet i = 0; // we have i already declared and assigned\n\nfor (; i < 3; i++) { // no need for \"begin\"\n  alert( i ); // 0, 1, 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can also remove the `step` part:\n\n```js run\nlet i = 0;\n\nfor (; i < 3;) {\n  alert( i++ );\n}\n```\n\nThis makes the loop identical to `while (i < 3)`.\n\nWe can actually remove everything, creating an infinite loop:\n\n```js\nfor (;;) {\n  // repeats without limits\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the two `for` semicolons `;` must be present. Otherwise, there would be a syntax error.\n\n## Breaking the loop\n\nNormally, a loop exits when its condition becomes falsy.\n\nBut we can force the exit at any time using the special `break` directive.\n\nFor example, the loop below asks the user for a series of numbers, \"breaking\" when no number is entered:\n\n```js run\nlet sum = 0;\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n  let value = +prompt(\"Enter a number\", '');\n\n*!*\n  if (!value) break; // (*)\n*/!*\n\n  sum += value;\n\n}\nalert( 'Sum: ' + sum );\n```\n\nThe `break` directive is activated at the line `(*)` if the user enters an empty line or cancels the input. It stops the loop immediately, passing control to the first line after the loop. Namely, `alert`.\n\nThe combination \"infinite loop + `break` as needed\" is great for situations when a loop's condition must be checked not in the beginning or end of the loop, but in the middle or even in several places of its body.\n\n## Continue to the next iteration [#continue]\n\nThe `continue` directive is a \"lighter version\" of `break`. It doesn't stop the whole loop. Instead, it stops the current iteration and forces the loop to start a new one (if the condition allows).\n\nWe can use it if we're done with the current iteration and would like to move on to the next one.\n\nThe loop below uses `continue` to output only odd values:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nfor (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n\n  // if true, skip the remaining part of the body\n  *!*if (i % 2 == 0) continue;*/!*\n\n  alert(i); // 1, then 3, 5, 7, 9\n}\n```\n\nFor even values of `i`, the `continue` directive stops executing the body and passes control to the next iteration of `for` (with the next number). So the `alert` is only called for odd values.\n\n````smart header=\"The `continue` directive helps decrease nesting\"\nA loop that shows odd values could look like this:\n\n```js run\nfor (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n\n  if (i % 2) {\n    alert( i );\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\nFrom a technical point of view, this is identical to the example above. Surely, we can just wrap the code in an `if` block instead of using `continue`.\n\nBut as a side-effect, this created one more level of nesting (the `alert` call inside the curly braces). If the code inside of `if` is longer than a few lines, that may decrease the overall readability.\n````\n\n````warn header=\"No `break/continue` to the right side of '?'\"\nPlease note that syntax constructs that are not expressions cannot be used with the ternary operator `?`. In particular, directives such as `break/continue` aren't allowed there.\n\nFor example, if we take this code:\n\n```js\nif (i > 5) {\n  alert(i);\n} else {\n  continue;\n}\n```\n\n...and rewrite it using a question mark:\n\n\n```js no-beautify\n(i > 5) ? alert(i) : *!*continue*/!*; // continue isn't allowed here\n```\n\n...it stops working: there's a syntax error.\n\nThis is just another reason not to use the question mark operator `?` instead of `if`.\n````\n\n## Labels for break/continue\n\nSometimes we need to break out from multiple nested loops at once.\n\nFor example, in the code below we loop over `i` and `j`, prompting for the coordinates `(i, j)` from `(0,0)` to `(2,2)`:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nfor (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n\n  for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {\n\n    let input = prompt(`Value at coords (${i},${j})`, '');\n\n    // what if we want to exit from here to Done (below)?\n  }\n}\n\nalert('Done!');\n```\n\nWe need a way to stop the process if the user cancels the input.\n\nThe ordinary `break` after `input` would only break the inner loop. That's not sufficient--labels, come to the rescue!\n\nA *label* is an identifier with a colon before a loop:\n```js\nlabelName: for (...) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `break <labelName>` statement in the loop below breaks out to the label:\n\n```js run no-beautify\n*!*outer:*/!* for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n\n  for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {\n\n    let input = prompt(`Value at coords (${i},${j})`, '');\n\n    // if an empty string or canceled, then break out of both loops\n    if (!input) *!*break outer*/!*; // (*)\n\n    // do something with the value...\n  }\n}\nalert('Done!');\n```\n\nIn the code above, `break outer` looks upwards for the label named `outer` and breaks out of that loop.\n\nSo the control goes straight from `(*)` to `alert('Done!')`.\n\nWe can also move the label onto a separate line:\n\n```js no-beautify\nouter:\nfor (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { ... }\n```\n\nThe `continue` directive can also be used with a label. In this case, code execution jumps to the next iteration of the labeled loop.\n\n````warn header=\"Labels do not allow to \\\"jump\\\" anywhere\"\nLabels do not allow us to jump into an arbitrary place in the code.\n\nFor example, it is impossible to do this:\n```js\nbreak label; // doesn't jumps to the label below\n\nlabel: for (...)\n```\n\nA call to `break/continue` is only possible from inside a loop and the label must be somewhere above the directive.\n````\n\n## Summary\n\nWe covered 3 types of loops:\n\n- `while` -- The condition is checked before each iteration.\n- `do..while` -- The condition is checked after each iteration.\n- `for (;;)` -- The condition is checked before each iteration, additional settings available.\n\nTo make an \"infinite\" loop, usually the `while(true)` construct is used. Such a loop, just like any other, can be stopped with the `break` directive.\n\nIf we don't want to do anything in the current iteration and would like to forward to the next one, we can use the `continue` directive.\n\n`break/continue` support labels before the loop. A label is the only way for `break/continue` to escape a nested loop to go to an outer one.",

        "content": "\n\nA `switch` statement can replace multiple `if` checks.\n\nIt gives a more descriptive way to compare a value with multiple variants.\n\n## The syntax\n\nThe `switch` has one or more `case` blocks and an optional default.\n\nIt looks like this:\n\n```js no-beautify\nswitch(x) {\n  case 'value1':  // if (x === 'value1')\n    ...\n    [break]\n\n  case 'value2':  // if (x === 'value2')\n    ...\n    [break]\n\n  default:\n    ...\n    [break]\n}\n```\n\n- The value of `x` is checked for a strict equality to the value from the first `case` (that is, `value1`) then to the second (`value2`) and so on.\n- If the equality is found, `switch` starts to execute the code starting from the corresponding `case`, until the nearest `break` (or until the end of `switch`).\n- If no case is matched then the `default` code is executed (if it exists).\n\n## An example\n\nAn example of `switch` (the executed code is highlighted):\n\n```js run\nlet a = 2 + 2;\n\nswitch (a) {\n  case 3:\n    alert( 'Too small' );\n    break;\n*!*\n  case 4:\n    alert( 'Exactly!' );\n    break;\n*/!*\n  case 5:\n    alert( 'Too large' );\n    break;\n  default:\n    alert( \"I don't know such values\" );\n}\n```\n\nHere the `switch` starts to compare `a` from the first `case` variant that is `3`. The match fails.\n\nThen `4`. That's a match, so the execution starts from `case 4` until the nearest `break`.\n\n**If there is no `break` then the execution continues with the next `case` without any checks.**\n\nAn example without `break`:\n\n```js run\nlet a = 2 + 2;\n\nswitch (a) {\n  case 3:\n    alert( 'Too small' );\n*!*\n  case 4:\n    alert( 'Exactly!' );\n  case 5:\n    alert( 'Too big' );\n  default:\n    alert( \"I don't know such values\" );\n*/!*\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above we'll see sequential execution of three `alert`s:\n\n```js\nalert( 'Exactly!' );\nalert( 'Too big' );\nalert( \"I don't know such values\" );\n```\n\n````smart header=\"Any expression can be a `switch/case` argument\"\nBoth `switch` and `case` allow arbitrary expressions.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nlet a = \"1\";\nlet b = 0;\n\nswitch (+a) {\n*!*\n  case b + 1:\n    alert(\"this runs, because +a is 1, exactly equals b+1\");\n    break;\n*/!*\n\n  default:\n    alert(\"this doesn't run\");\n}\n```\nHere `+a` gives `1`, that's compared with `b + 1` in `case`, and the corresponding code is executed.\n````\n\n## Grouping of \"case\"\n\nSeveral variants of `case` which share the same code can be grouped.\n\nFor example, if we want the same code to run for `case 3` and `case 5`:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nlet a = 3;\n\nswitch (a) {\n  case 4:\n    alert('Right!');\n    break;\n\n*!*\n  case 3: // (*) grouped two cases\n  case 5:\n    alert('Wrong!');\n    alert(\"Why don't you take a math class?\");\n    break;\n*/!*\n\n  default:\n    alert('The result is strange. Really.');\n}\n```\n\nNow both `3` and `5` show the same message.\n\nThe ability to \"group\" cases is a side-effect of how `switch/case` works without `break`. Here the execution of `case 3` starts from the line `(*)` and goes through `case 5`, because there's no `break`.\n\n## Type matters\n\nLet's emphasize that the equality check is always strict. The values must be of the same type to match.\n\nFor example, let's consider the code:\n\n```js run\nlet arg = prompt(\"Enter a value?\");\nswitch (arg) {\n  case '0':\n  case '1':\n    alert( 'One or zero' );\n    break;\n\n  case '2':\n    alert( 'Two' );\n    break;\n\n  case 3:\n    alert( 'Never executes!' );\n    break;\n  default:\n    alert( 'An unknown value' );\n}\n```\n\n1. For `0`, `1`, the first `alert` runs.\n2. For `2` the second `alert` runs.\n3. But for `3`, the result of the `prompt` is a string `\"3\"`, which is not strictly equal `===` to the number `3`. So we've got a dead code in `case 3`! The `default` variant will execute.",

        "content": "\n\nQuite often we need to perform a similar action in many places of the script.\n\nFor example, we need to show a nice-looking message when a visitor logs in, logs out and maybe somewhere else.\n\nFunctions are the main \"building blocks\" of the program. They allow the code to be called many times without repetition.\n\nWe've already seen examples of built-in functions, like `alert(message)`, `prompt(message, default)` and `confirm(question)`. But we can create functions of our own as well.\n\n## Function Declaration\n\nTo create a function we can use a *function declaration*.\n\nIt looks like this:\n\n```js\nfunction showMessage() {\n  alert( 'Hello everyone!' );\n}\n```\n\nThe `function` keyword goes first, then goes the *name of the function*, then a list of *parameters* between the parentheses (comma-separated, empty in the example above) and finally the code of the function, also named \"the function body\", between curly braces.\n\n```js\nfunction name(parameters) {\n  ...body...\n}\n```\n\nOur new function can be called by its name: `showMessage()`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nfunction showMessage() {\n  alert( 'Hello everyone!' );\n}\n\n*!*\nshowMessage();\nshowMessage();\n*/!*\n```\n\nThe call `showMessage()` executes the code of the function. Here we will see the message two times.\n\nThis example clearly demonstrates one of the main purposes of functions: to avoid code duplication.\n\nIf we ever need to change the message or the way it is shown, it's enough to modify the code in one place: the function which outputs it.\n\n## Local variables\n\nA variable declared inside a function is only visible inside that function.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nfunction showMessage() {\n*!*\n  let message = \"Hello, I'm JavaScript!\"; // local variable\n*/!*\n\n  alert( message );\n}\n\nshowMessage(); // Hello, I'm JavaScript!\n\nalert( message ); // <-- Error! The variable is local to the function\n```\n\n## Outer variables\n\nA function can access an outer variable as well, for example:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nlet *!*userName*/!* = 'John';\n\nfunction showMessage() {\n  let message = 'Hello, ' + *!*userName*/!*;\n  alert(message);\n}\n\nshowMessage(); // Hello, John\n```\n\nThe function has full access to the outer variable. It can modify it as well.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet *!*userName*/!* = 'John';\n\nfunction showMessage() {\n  *!*userName*/!* = \"Bob\"; // (1) changed the outer variable\n\n  let message = 'Hello, ' + *!*userName*/!*;\n  alert(message);\n}\n\nalert( userName ); // *!*John*/!* before the function call\n\nshowMessage();\n\nalert( userName ); // *!*Bob*/!*, the value was modified by the function\n```\n\nThe outer variable is only used if there's no local one.\n\nIf a same-named variable is declared inside the function then it *shadows* the outer one. For instance, in the code below the function uses the local `userName`. The outer one is ignored:\n\n```js run\nlet userName = 'John';\n\nfunction showMessage() {\n*!*\n  let userName = \"Bob\"; // declare a local variable\n*/!*\n\n  let message = 'Hello, ' + userName; // *!*Bob*/!*\n  alert(message);\n}\n\n// the function will create and use its own userName\nshowMessage();\n\nalert( userName ); // *!*John*/!*, unchanged, the function did not access the outer variable\n```\n\n```smart header=\"Global variables\"\nVariables declared outside of any function, such as the outer `userName` in the code above, are called *global*.\n\nGlobal variables are visible from any function (unless shadowed by locals).\n\nIt's a good practice to minimize the use of global variables. Modern code has few or no globals. Most variables reside in their functions. Sometimes though, they can be useful to store project-level data.\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\nWe can pass arbitrary data to functions using parameters (also called *function arguments*) .\n\nIn the example below, the function has two parameters: `from` and `text`.\n\n```js run\nfunction showMessage(*!*from, text*/!*) { // arguments: from, text\n  alert(from + ': ' + text);\n}\n\n*!*\nshowMessage('Ann', 'Hello!'); // Ann: Hello! (*)\nshowMessage('Ann', \"What's up?\"); // Ann: What's up? (**)\n*/!*\n```\n\nWhen the function is called in lines `(*)` and `(**)`, the given values are copied to local variables `from` and `text`. Then the function uses them.\n\nHere's one more example: we have a variable `from` and pass it to the function. Please note: the function changes `from`, but the change is not seen outside, because a function always gets a copy of the value:\n\n\n```js run\nfunction showMessage(from, text) {\n\n*!*\n  from = '*' + from + '*'; // make \"from\" look nicer\n*/!*\n\n  alert( from + ': ' + text );\n}\n\nlet from = \"Ann\";\n\nshowMessage(from, \"Hello\"); // *Ann*: Hello\n\n// the value of \"from\" is the same, the function modified a local copy\nalert( from ); // Ann\n```\n\n## Default values\n\nIf a parameter is not provided, then its value becomes `undefined`.\n\nFor instance, the aforementioned function `showMessage(from, text)` can be called with a single argument:\n\n```js\nshowMessage(\"Ann\");\n```\n\nThat's not an error. Such a call would output `\"Ann: undefined\"`. There's no `text`, so it's assumed that `text === undefined`.\n\nIf we want to use a \"default\" `text` in this case, then we can specify it after `=`:\n\n```js run\nfunction showMessage(from, *!*text = \"no text given\"*/!*) {\n  alert( from + \": \" + text );\n}\n\nshowMessage(\"Ann\"); // Ann: no text given\n```\n\nNow if the `text` parameter is not passed, it will get the value `\"no text given\"`\n\nHere `\"no text given\"` is a string, but it can be a more complex expression, which is only evaluated and assigned if the parameter is missing. So, this is also possible:\n\n```js run\nfunction showMessage(from, text = anotherFunction()) {\n  // anotherFunction() only executed if no text given\n  // its result becomes the value of text\n}\n```\n\n```smart header=\"Evaluation of default parameters\"\nIn JavaScript, a default parameter is evaluated every time the function is called without the respective parameter.\n\nIn the example above, `anotherFunction()` is called every time `showMessage()` is called without the `text` parameter.\n```\n\n### Alternative default parameters\n\nSometimes it makes sense to set default values for parameters not in the function declaration, but at a later stage, during its execution.\n\nTo check for an omitted parameter, we can compare it with `undefined`:\n\n```js run\nfunction showMessage(text) {\n*!*\n  if (text === undefined) {\n    text = 'empty message';\n  }\n*/!*\n\n  alert(text);\n}\n\nshowMessage(); // empty message\n```\n\n...Or we could use the `||` operator:\n\n```js\n// if text parameter is omitted or \"\" is passed, set it to 'empty'\nfunction showMessage(text) {\n  text = text || 'empty';\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nModern JavaScript engines support the [nullish coalescing operator](info:nullish-coalescing-operator) `??`, it's better when falsy values, such as `0`, are considered regular:\n\n```js run\n// if there's no \"count\" parameter, show \"unknown\"\nfunction showCount(count) {\n  alert(count ?? \"unknown\");\n}\n\nshowCount(0); // 0\nshowCount(null); // unknown\nshowCount(); // unknown\n```\n\n## Returning a value\n\nA function can return a value back into the calling code as the result.\n\nThe simplest example would be a function that sums two values:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nfunction sum(a, b) {\n  *!*return*/!* a + b;\n}\n\nlet result = sum(1, 2);\nalert( result ); // 3\n```\n\nThe directive `return` can be in any place of the function. When the execution reaches it, the function stops, and the value is returned to the calling code (assigned to `result` above).\n\nThere may be many occurrences of `return` in a single function. For instance:\n\n```js run\nfunction checkAge(age) {\n  if (age >= 18) {\n*!*\n    return true;\n*/!*\n  } else {\n*!*\n    return confirm('Do you have permission from your parents?');\n*/!*\n  }\n}\n\nlet age = prompt('How old are you?', 18);\n\nif ( checkAge(age) ) {\n  alert( 'Access granted' );\n} else {\n  alert( 'Access denied' );\n}\n```\n\nIt is possible to use `return` without a value. That causes the function to exit immediately.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nfunction showMovie(age) {\n  if ( !checkAge(age) ) {\n*!*\n    return;\n*/!*\n  }\n\n  alert( \"Showing you the movie\" ); // (*)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn the code above, if `checkAge(age)` returns `false`, then `showMovie` won't proceed to the `alert`.\n\n````smart header=\"A function with an empty `return` or without it returns `undefined`\"\nIf a function does not return a value, it is the same as if it returns `undefined`:\n\n```js run\nfunction doNothing() { /* empty */ }\n\nalert( doNothing() === undefined ); // true\n```\n\nAn empty `return` is also the same as `return undefined`:\n\n```js run\nfunction doNothing() {\n  return;\n}\n\nalert( doNothing() === undefined ); // true\n```\n````\n\n````warn header=\"Never add a newline between `return` and the value\"\nFor a long expression in `return`, it might be tempting to put it on a separate line, like this:\n\n```js\nreturn\n (some + long + expression + or + whatever * f(a) + f(b))\n```\nThat doesn't work, because JavaScript assumes a semicolon after `return`. That'll work the same as:\n\n```js\nreturn*!*;*/!*\n (some + long + expression + or + whatever * f(a) + f(b))\n```\n\nSo, it effectively becomes an empty return.\n\nIf we want the returned expression to wrap across multiple lines, we should start it at the same line as `return`. Or at least put the opening parentheses there as follows:\n\n```js\nreturn (\n  some + long + expression\n  + or +\n  whatever * f(a) + f(b)\n  )\n```\nAnd it will work just as we expect it to.\n````\n\n## Naming a function [#function-naming]\n\nFunctions are actions. So their name is usually a verb. It should be brief, as accurate as possible and describe what the function does, so that someone reading the code gets an indication of what the function does.\n\nIt is a widespread practice to start a function with a verbal prefix which vaguely describes the action. There must be an agreement within the team on the meaning of the prefixes.\n\nFor instance, functions that start with `\"show\"` usually show something.\n\nFunction starting with...\n\n- `\"get…\"` -- return a value,\n- `\"calc…\"` -- calculate something,\n- `\"create…\"` -- create something,\n- `\"check…\"` -- check something and return a boolean, etc.\n\nExamples of such names:\n\n```js no-beautify\nshowMessage(..)     // shows a message\ngetAge(..)          // returns the age (gets it somehow)\ncalcSum(..)         // calculates a sum and returns the result\ncreateForm(..)      // creates a form (and usually returns it)\ncheckPermission(..) // checks a permission, returns true/false\n```\n\nWith prefixes in place, a glance at a function name gives an understanding what kind of work it does and what kind of value it returns.\n\n```smart header=\"One function -- one action\"\nA function should do exactly what is suggested by its name, no more.\n\nTwo independent actions usually deserve two functions, even if they are usually called together (in that case we can make a 3rd function that calls those two).\n\nA few examples of breaking this rule:\n\n- `getAge` -- would be bad if it shows an `alert` with the age (should only get).\n- `createForm` -- would be bad if it modifies the document, adding a form to it (should only create it and return).\n- `checkPermission` -- would be bad if it displays the `access granted/denied` message (should only perform the check and return the result).\n\nThese examples assume common meanings of prefixes. You and your team are free to agree on other meanings, but usually they're not much different. In any case, you should have a firm understanding of what a prefix means, what a prefixed function can and cannot do. All same-prefixed functions should obey the rules. And the team should share the knowledge.\n```\n\n```smart header=\"Ultrashort function names\"\nFunctions that are used *very often* sometimes have ultrashort names.\n\nFor example, the [jQuery](http://jquery.com) framework defines a function with `$`. The [Lodash](http://lodash.com/) library has its core function named `_`.\n\nThese are exceptions. Generally functions names should be concise and descriptive.\n```\n\n## Functions == Comments\n\nFunctions should be short and do exactly one thing. If that thing is big, maybe it's worth it to split the function into a few smaller functions. Sometimes following this rule may not be that easy, but it's definitely a good thing.\n\nA separate function is not only easier to test and debug -- its very existence is a great comment!\n\nFor instance, compare the two functions `showPrimes(n)` below. Each one outputs [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) up to `n`.\n\nThe first variant uses a label:\n\n```js\nfunction showPrimes(n) {\n  nextPrime: for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {\n\n    for (let j = 2; j < i; j++) {\n      if (i % j == 0) continue nextPrime;\n    }\n\n    alert( i ); // a prime\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe second variant uses an additional function `isPrime(n)` to test for primality:\n\n```js\nfunction showPrimes(n) {\n\n  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {\n    *!*if (!isPrime(i)) continue;*/!*\n\n    alert(i);  // a prime\n  }\n}\n\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {\n    if ( n % i == 0) return false;\n  }\n  return true;\n}\n```\n\nThe second variant is easier to understand, isn't it? Instead of the code piece we see a name of the action (`isPrime`). Sometimes people refer to such code as *self-describing*.\n\nSo, functions can be created even if we don't intend to reuse them. They structure the code and make it readable.\n\n## Summary\n\nA function declaration looks like this:\n\n```js\nfunction name(parameters, delimited, by, comma) {\n  /* code */\n}\n```\n\n- Values passed to a function as parameters are copied to its local variables.\n- A function may access outer variables. But it works only from inside out. The code outside of the function doesn't see its local variables.\n- A function can return a value. If it doesn't, then its result is `undefined`.\n\nTo make the code clean and easy to understand, it's recommended to use mainly local variables and parameters in the function, not outer variables.\n\nIt is always easier to understand a function which gets parameters, works with them and returns a result than a function which gets no parameters, but modifies outer variables as a side-effect.\n\nFunction naming:\n\n- A name should clearly describe what the function does. When we see a function call in the code, a good name instantly gives us an understanding what it does and returns.\n- A function is an action, so function names are usually verbal.\n- There exist many well-known function prefixes like `create…`, `show…`, `get…`, `check…` and so on. Use them to hint what a function does.\n\nFunctions are the main building blocks of scripts. Now we've covered the basics, so we actually can start creating and using them. But that's only the beginning of the path. We are going to return to them many times, going more deeply into their advanced features.",

        "content": "\n\nIn JavaScript, a function is not a \"magical language structure\", but a special kind of value.\n\nThe syntax that we used before is called a *Function Declaration*:\n\n```js\nfunction sayHi() {\n  alert( \"Hello\" );\n}\n```\n\nThere is another syntax for creating a function that is called a *Function Expression*.\n\nIt looks like this:\n\n```js\nlet sayHi = function() {\n  alert( \"Hello\" );\n};\n```\n\nHere, the function is created and assigned to the variable explicitly, like any other value. No matter how the function is defined, it's just a value stored in the variable `sayHi`.\n\nThe meaning of these code samples is the same: \"create a function and put it into the variable `sayHi`\".\n\nWe can even print out that value using `alert`:\n\n```js run\nfunction sayHi() {\n  alert( \"Hello\" );\n}\n\n*!*\nalert( sayHi ); // shows the function code\n*/!*\n```\n\nPlease note that the last line does not run the function, because there are no parentheses after `sayHi`. There are programming languages where any mention of a function name causes its execution, but JavaScript is not like that.\n\nIn JavaScript, a function is a value, so we can deal with it as a value. The code above shows its string representation, which is the source code.\n\nSurely, a function is a special value, in the sense that we can call it like `sayHi()`.\n\nBut it's still a value. So we can work with it like with other kinds of values.\n\nWe can copy a function to another variable:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nfunction sayHi() {   // (1) create\n  alert( \"Hello\" );\n}\n\nlet func = sayHi;    // (2) copy\n\nfunc(); // Hello     // (3) run the copy (it works)!\nsayHi(); // Hello    //     this still works too (why wouldn't it)\n```\n\nHere's what happens above in detail:\n\n1. The Function Declaration `(1)` creates the function and puts it into the variable named `sayHi`.\n2. Line `(2)` copies it into the variable `func`. Please note again: there are no parentheses after `sayHi`. If there were, then `func = sayHi()` would write  *the result of the call* `sayHi()` into `func`, not *the function* `sayHi` itself.\n3. Now the function can be called as both `sayHi()` and `func()`.\n\nNote that we could also have used a Function Expression to declare `sayHi`, in the first line:\n\n```js\nlet sayHi = function() {\n  alert( \"Hello\" );\n};\n\nlet func = sayHi;\n// ...\n```\n\nEverything would work the same.\n\n\n````smart header=\"Why is there a semicolon at the end?\"\nYou might wonder, why does Function Expression have a semicolon `;` at the end, but Function Declaration does not:\n\n```js\nfunction sayHi() {\n  // ...\n}\n\nlet sayHi = function() {\n  // ...\n}*!*;*/!*\n```\n\nThe answer is simple:\n- There's no need for `;` at the end of code blocks and syntax structures that use them like `if { ... }`, `for {  }`, `function f { }` etc.\n- A Function Expression is used inside the statement: `let sayHi = ...;`, as a value. It's not a code block, but rather an assignment. The semicolon `;` is recommended at the end of statements, no matter what the value is. So the semicolon here is not related to the Function Expression itself, it just terminates the statement.\n````\n\n## Callback functions\n\nLet's look at more examples of passing functions as values and using function expressions.\n\nWe'll write a function `ask(question, yes, no)` with three parameters:\n\n`question`\n: Text of the question\n\n`yes`\n: Function to run if the answer is \"Yes\"\n\n`no`\n: Function to run if the answer is \"No\"\n\nThe function should ask the `question` and, depending on the user's answer, call `yes()` or `no()`:\n\n```js run\n*!*\nfunction ask(question, yes, no) {\n  if (confirm(question)) yes()\n  else no();\n}\n*/!*\n\nfunction showOk() {\n  alert( \"You agreed.\" );\n}\n\nfunction showCancel() {\n  alert( \"You canceled the execution.\" );\n}\n\n// usage: functions showOk, showCancel are passed as arguments to ask\nask(\"Do you agree?\", showOk, showCancel);\n```\n\nIn practice, such functions are quite useful. The major difference between a real-life `ask` and the example above is that real-life functions use more complex ways to interact with the user than a simple `confirm`. In the browser, such function usually draws a nice-looking question window. But that's another story.\n\n**The arguments `showOk` and `showCancel` of `ask` are called *callback functions* or just *callbacks*.**\n\nThe idea is that we pass a function and expect it to be \"called back\" later if necessary. In our case, `showOk` becomes the callback for \"yes\" answer, and `showCancel` for \"no\" answer.\n\nWe can use Function Expressions to write the same function much shorter:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nfunction ask(question, yes, no) {\n  if (confirm(question)) yes()\n  else no();\n}\n\n*!*\nask(\n  \"Do you agree?\",\n  function() { alert(\"You agreed.\"); },\n  function() { alert(\"You canceled the execution.\"); }\n);\n*/!*\n```\n\nHere, functions are declared right inside the `ask(...)` call. They have no name, and so are called *anonymous*. Such functions are not accessible outside of `ask` (because they are not assigned to variables), but that's just what we want here.\n\nSuch code appears in our scripts very naturally, it's in the spirit of JavaScript.\n\n```smart header=\"A function is a value representing an \\\"action\\\"\"\nRegular values like strings or numbers represent the *data*.\n\nA function can be perceived as an *action*.\n\nWe can pass it between variables and run when we want.\n```\n\n\n## Function Expression vs Function Declaration\n\nLet's formulate the key differences between Function Declarations and Expressions.\n\nFirst, the syntax: how to differentiate between them in the code.\n\n- *Function Declaration:* a function, declared as a separate statement, in the main code flow.\n\n    ```js\n    // Function Declaration\n    function sum(a, b) {\n      return a + b;\n    }\n    ```\n- *Function Expression:* a function, created inside an expression or inside another syntax construct. Here, the function is created at the right side of the \"assignment expression\" `=`:\n\n    ```js\n    // Function Expression\n    let sum = function(a, b) {\n      return a + b;\n    };\n    ```\n\nThe more subtle difference is *when* a function is created by the JavaScript engine.\n\n**A Function Expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable only from that moment.**\n\nOnce the execution flow passes to the right side of the assignment `let sum = function…` -- here we go, the function is created and can be used (assigned, called, etc. ) from now on.\n\nFunction Declarations are different.\n\n**A Function Declaration can be called earlier than it is defined.**\n\nFor example, a global Function Declaration is visible in the whole script, no matter where it is.\n\nThat's due to internal algorithms. When JavaScript prepares to run the script, it first looks for global Function Declarations in it and creates the functions. We can think of it as an \"initialization stage\".\n\nAnd after all Function Declarations are processed, the code is executed. So it has access to these functions.\n\nFor example, this works:\n\n```js run refresh untrusted\n*!*\nsayHi(\"John\"); // Hello, John\n*/!*\n\nfunction sayHi(name) {\n  alert( `Hello, ${name}` );\n}\n```\n\nThe Function Declaration `sayHi` is created when JavaScript is preparing to start the script and is visible everywhere in it.\n\n...If it were a Function Expression, then it wouldn't work:\n\n```js run refresh untrusted\n*!*\nsayHi(\"John\"); // error!\n*/!*\n\nlet sayHi = function(name) {  // (*) no magic any more\n  alert( `Hello, ${name}` );\n};\n```\n\nFunction Expressions are created when the execution reaches them. That would happen only in the line `(*)`. Too late.\n\nAnother special feature of Function Declarations is their block scope.\n\n**In strict mode, when a Function Declaration is within a code block, it's visible everywhere inside that block. But not outside of it.**\n\nFor instance, let's imagine that we need to declare a function `welcome()` depending on the `age` variable that we get during runtime. And then we plan to use it some time later.\n\nIf we use Function Declaration, it won't work as intended:\n\n```js run\nlet age = prompt(\"What is your age?\", 18);\n\n// conditionally declare a function\nif (age < 18) {\n\n  function welcome() {\n    alert(\"Hello!\");\n  }\n\n} else {\n\n  function welcome() {\n    alert(\"Greetings!\");\n  }\n\n}\n\n// ...use it later\n*!*\nwelcome(); // Error: welcome is not defined\n*/!*\n```\n\nThat's because a Function Declaration is only visible inside the code block in which it resides.\n\nHere's another example:\n\n```js run\nlet age = 16; // take 16 as an example\n\nif (age < 18) {\n*!*\n  welcome();               // \\   (runs)\n*/!*\n                           //  |\n  function welcome() {     //  |  \n    alert(\"Hello!\");       //  |  Function Declaration is available\n  }                        //  |  everywhere in the block where it's declared\n                           //  |\n*!*\n  welcome();               // /   (runs)\n*/!*\n\n} else {\n\n  function welcome() {    \n    alert(\"Greetings!\");\n  }\n}\n\n// Here we're out of curly braces,\n// so we can not see Function Declarations made inside of them.\n\n*!*\nwelcome(); // Error: welcome is not defined\n*/!*\n```\n\nWhat can we do to make `welcome` visible outside of `if`?\n\nThe correct approach would be to use a Function Expression and assign `welcome` to the variable that is declared outside of `if` and has the proper visibility.\n\nThis code works as intended:\n\n```js run\nlet age = prompt(\"What is your age?\", 18);\n\nlet welcome;\n\nif (age < 18) {\n\n  welcome = function() {\n    alert(\"Hello!\");\n  };\n\n} else {\n\n  welcome = function() {\n    alert(\"Greetings!\");\n  };\n\n}\n\n*!*\nwelcome(); // ok now\n*/!*\n```\n\nOr we could simplify it even further using a question mark operator `?`:\n\n```js run\nlet age = prompt(\"What is your age?\", 18);\n\nlet welcome = (age < 18) ?\n  function() { alert(\"Hello!\"); } :\n  function() { alert(\"Greetings!\"); };\n\n*!*\nwelcome(); // ok now\n*/!*\n```\n\n\n```smart header=\"When to choose Function Declaration versus Function Expression?\"\nAs a rule of thumb, when we need to declare a function, the first to consider is Function Declaration syntax. It gives more freedom in how to organize our code, because we can call such functions before they are declared.\n\nThat's also better for readability, as it's easier to look up `function f(…) {…}` in the code than `let f = function(…) {…};`. Function Declarations are more \"eye-catching\".\n\n...But if a Function Declaration does not suit us for some reason, or we need a conditional declaration (we've just seen an example), then Function Expression should be used.\n```\n\n## Summary\n\n- Functions are values. They can be assigned, copied or declared in any place of the code.\n- If the function is declared as a separate statement in the main code flow, that's called a \"Function Declaration\".\n- If the function is created as a part of an expression, it's called a \"Function Expression\".\n- Function Declarations are processed before the code block is executed. They are visible everywhere in the block.\n- Function Expressions are created when the execution flow reaches them.\n\nIn most cases when we need to declare a function, a Function Declaration is preferable, because it is visible prior to the declaration itself. That gives us more flexibility in code organization, and is usually more readable.\n\nSo we should use a Function Expression only when a Function Declaration is not fit for the task. We've seen a couple of examples of that in this chapter, and will see more in the future.",

        "content": "\n\nThere's another very simple and concise syntax for creating functions, that's often better than Function Expressions.\n\nIt's called \"arrow functions\", because it looks like this:\n\n```js\nlet func = (arg1, arg2, ...argN) => expression\n```\n\n...This creates a function `func` that accepts arguments `arg1..argN`, then evaluates the `expression` on the right side with their use and returns its result.\n\nIn other words, it's the shorter version of:\n\n```js\nlet func = function(arg1, arg2, ...argN) {\n  return expression;\n};\n```\n\nLet's see a concrete example:\n\n```js run\nlet sum = (a, b) => a + b;\n\n/* This arrow function is a shorter form of:\n\nlet sum = function(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n};\n*/\n\nalert( sum(1, 2) ); // 3\n```\n\nAs you can, see `(a, b) => a + b` means a function that accepts two arguments named `a` and `b`. Upon the execution, it evaluates the expression `a + b` and returns the result.\n\n- If we have only one argument, then parentheses around parameters can be omitted, making that even shorter.\n\n    For example:\n\n    ```js run\n    *!*\n    let double = n => n * 2;\n    // roughly the same as: let double = function(n) { return n * 2 }\n    */!*\n\n    alert( double(3) ); // 6\n    ```\n\n- If there are no arguments, parentheses will be empty (but they should be present):\n\n    ```js run\n    let sayHi = () => alert(\"Hello!\");\n\n    sayHi();\n    ```\n\nArrow functions can be used in the same way as Function Expressions.\n\nFor instance, to dynamically create a function:\n\n```js run\nlet age = prompt(\"What is your age?\", 18);\n\nlet welcome = (age < 18) ?\n  () => alert('Hello') :\n  () => alert(\"Greetings!\");\n\nwelcome();\n```\n\nArrow functions may appear unfamiliar and not very readable at first, but that quickly changes as the eyes get used to the structure.\n\nThey are very convenient for simple one-line actions, when we're just too lazy to write many words.\n\n## Multiline arrow functions\n\nThe examples above took arguments from the left of `=>` and evaluated the right-side expression with them.\n\nSometimes we need something a little bit more complex, like multiple expressions or statements. It is also possible, but we should enclose them in curly braces. Then use a normal `return` within them.\n\nLike this:\n\n```js run\nlet sum = (a, b) => {  // the curly brace opens a multiline function\n  let result = a + b;\n*!*\n  return result; // if we use curly braces, then we need an explicit \"return\" \n*/!*\n};\n\nalert( sum(1, 2) ); // 3\n```\n\n```smart header=\"More to come\"\nHere we praised arrow functions for brevity. But that's not all!\n\nArrow functions have other interesting features.\n\nTo study them in-depth, we first need to get to know some other aspects of JavaScript, so we'll return to arrow functions later in the chapter <info:arrow-functions>.\n\nFor now, we can already use arrow functions for one-line actions and callbacks.\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nArrow functions are handy for one-liners. They come in two flavors:\n\n1. Without curly braces: `(...args) => expression` -- the right side is an expression: the function evaluates it and returns the result.\n2. With curly braces: `(...args) => { body }` -- brackets allow us to write multiple statements inside the function, but we need an explicit `return` to return something.",

        "content": "\n\nThis chapter briefly recaps the features of JavaScript that we've learned by now, paying special attention to subtle moments.\n\n## Code structure\n\nStatements are delimited with a semicolon:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nalert('Hello'); alert('World');\n```\n\nUsually, a line-break is also treated as a delimiter, so that would also work:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nalert('Hello')\nalert('World')\n```\n\nThat's called \"automatic semicolon insertion\". Sometimes it doesn't work, for instance:\n\n```js run\nalert(\"There will be an error after this message\")\n\n[1, 2].forEach(alert)\n```\n\nMost codestyle guides agree that we should put a semicolon after each statement.\n\nSemicolons are not required after code blocks `{...}` and syntax constructs with them like loops:\n\n```js\nfunction f() {\n  // no semicolon needed after function declaration\n}\n\nfor(;;) {\n  // no semicolon needed after the loop\n}\n```\n\n...But even if we can put an \"extra\" semicolon somewhere, that's not an error. It will be ignored.\n\nMore in: <info:structure>.\n\n## Strict mode\n\nTo fully enable all features of modern JavaScript, we should start scripts with `\"use strict\"`.\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\n...\n```\n\nThe directive must be at the top of a script or at the beginning of a function body.\n\nWithout `\"use strict\"`, everything still works, but some features behave in the old-fashion, \"compatible\" way. We'd generally prefer the modern behavior.\n\nSome modern features of the language (like classes that we'll study in the future) enable strict mode implicitly.\n\nMore in: <info:strict-mode>.\n\n## Variables\n\nCan be declared using:\n\n- `let`\n- `const` (constant, can't be changed)\n- `var` (old-style, will see later)\n\nA variable name can include:\n- Letters and digits, but the first character may not be a digit.\n- Characters `$` and `_` are normal, on par with letters.\n- Non-Latin alphabets and hieroglyphs are also allowed, but commonly not used.\n\nVariables are dynamically typed. They can store any value:\n\n```js\nlet x = 5;\nx = \"John\";\n```\n\nThere are 8 data types:\n\n- `number` for both floating-point and integer numbers,\n- `bigint` for integer numbers of arbitrary length,\n- `string` for strings,\n- `boolean` for logical values: `true/false`,\n- `null` -- a type with a single value `null`, meaning \"empty\" or \"does not exist\",\n- `undefined` -- a type with a single value `undefined`, meaning \"not assigned\",\n- `object` and `symbol` -- for complex data structures and unique identifiers, we haven't learnt them yet.\n\nThe `typeof` operator returns the type for a value, with two exceptions:\n```js\ntypeof null == \"object\" // error in the language\ntypeof function(){} == \"function\" // functions are treated specially\n```\n\nMore in: <info:variables> and <info:types>.\n\n## Interaction\n\nWe're using a browser as a working environment, so basic UI functions will be:\n\n[`prompt(question, [default])`](mdn:api/Window/prompt)\n: Ask a `question`, and return either what the visitor entered or `null` if they clicked \"cancel\".\n\n[`confirm(question)`](mdn:api/Window/confirm)\n: Ask a `question` and suggest to choose between Ok and Cancel. The choice is returned as `true/false`.\n\n[`alert(message)`](mdn:api/Window/alert)\n: Output a `message`.\n\nAll these functions are *modal*, they pause the code execution and prevent the visitor from interacting with the page until they answer.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet userName = prompt(\"Your name?\", \"Alice\");\nlet isTeaWanted = confirm(\"Do you want some tea?\");\n\nalert( \"Visitor: \" + userName ); // Alice\nalert( \"Tea wanted: \" + isTeaWanted ); // true\n```\n\nMore in: <info:alert-prompt-confirm>.\n\n## Operators\n\nJavaScript supports the following operators:\n\nArithmetical\n: Regular: `* + - /`, also `%` for the remainder and `**` for power of a number.\n\n    The binary plus `+` concatenates strings. And if any of the operands is a string, the other one is converted to string too:\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( '1' + 2 ); // '12', string\n    alert( 1 + '2' ); // '12', string\n    ```\n\nAssignments\n: There is a simple assignment: `a = b` and combined ones like `a *= 2`.\n\nBitwise\n: Bitwise operators work with 32-bit integers at the lowest, bit-level: see the [docs](mdn:/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators) when they are needed.\n\nConditional\n: The only operator with three parameters: `cond ? resultA : resultB`. If `cond` is truthy, returns `resultA`, otherwise `resultB`.\n\nLogical operators\n: Logical AND `&&` and OR `||` perform short-circuit evaluation and then return the value where it stopped (not necessary `true`/`false`). Logical NOT `!` converts the operand to boolean type and returns the inverse value.\n\nNullish coalescing operator\n: The `??` operator provides a way to choose a defined value from a list of variables. The result of `a ?? b` is `a` unless it's `null/undefined`, then `b`.\n\nComparisons\n: Equality check `==` for values of different types converts them to a number (except `null` and `undefined` that equal each other and nothing else), so these are equal:\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( 0 == false ); // true\n    alert( 0 == '' ); // true\n    ```\n\n    Other comparisons convert to a number as well.\n\n    The strict equality operator `===` doesn't do the conversion: different types always mean different values for it.\n\n    Values `null` and `undefined` are special: they equal `==` each other and don't equal anything else.\n\n    Greater/less comparisons compare strings character-by-character, other types are converted to a number.\n\nOther operators\n: There are few others, like a comma operator.\n\nMore in: <info:operators>, <info:comparison>, <info:logical-operators>, <info:nullish-coalescing-operator>.\n\n## Loops\n\n- We covered 3 types of loops:\n\n    ```js\n    // 1\n    while (condition) {\n      ...\n    }\n\n    // 2\n    do {\n      ...\n    } while (condition);\n\n    // 3\n    for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n      ...\n    }\n    ```\n\n- The variable declared in `for(let...)` loop is visible only inside the loop. But we can also omit `let` and reuse an existing variable.\n- Directives `break/continue` allow to exit the whole loop/current iteration. Use labels to break nested loops.\n\nDetails in: <info:while-for>.\n\nLater we'll study more types of loops to deal with objects.\n\n## The \"switch\" construct\n\nThe \"switch\" construct can replace multiple `if` checks. It uses `===` (strict equality) for comparisons.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet age = prompt('Your age?', 18);\n\nswitch (age) {\n  case 18:\n    alert(\"Won't work\"); // the result of prompt is a string, not a number\n    break;\n\n  case \"18\":\n    alert(\"This works!\");\n    break;\n\n  default:\n    alert(\"Any value not equal to one above\");\n}\n```\n\nDetails in: <info:switch>.\n\n## Functions\n\nWe covered three ways to create a function in JavaScript:\n\n1. Function Declaration: the function in the main code flow\n\n    ```js\n    function sum(a, b) {\n      let result = a + b;\n\n      return result;\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. Function Expression: the function in the context of an expression\n\n    ```js\n    let sum = function(a, b) {\n      let result = a + b;\n\n      return result;\n    };\n    ```\n\n3. Arrow functions:\n\n    ```js\n    // expression at the right side\n    let sum = (a, b) => a + b;\n\n    // or multi-line syntax with { ... }, need return here:\n    let sum = (a, b) => {\n      // ...\n      return a + b;\n    }\n\n    // without arguments\n    let sayHi = () => alert(\"Hello\");\n\n    // with a single argument\n    let double = n => n * 2;\n    ```\n\n\n- Functions may have local variables: those declared inside its body. Such variables are only visible inside the function.\n- Parameters can have default values: `function sum(a = 1, b = 2) {...}`.\n- Functions always return something. If there's no `return` statement, then the result is `undefined`.\n\nDetails: see <info:function-basics>, <info:arrow-functions-basics>.\n\n## More to come\n\nThat was a brief list of JavaScript features. As of now we've studied only basics. Further in the tutorial you'll find more specials and advanced features of JavaScript.",

        "content": "\n\nBefore writing more complex code, let's talk about debugging.\n\n[Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging) is the process of finding and fixing errors within a script. All modern browsers and most other environments support debugging tools -- a special UI in developer tools that makes debugging much easier. It also allows to trace the code step by step to see what exactly is going on.\n\nWe'll be using Chrome here, because it has enough features, most other browsers have a similar process.\n\n## The \"Sources\" panel\n\nYour Chrome version may look a little bit different, but it still should be obvious what's there.\n\n- Open the [example page](debugging/index.html) in Chrome.\n- Turn on developer tools with `key:F12` (Mac: `key:Cmd+Opt+I`).\n- Select the `Sources` panel.\n\nHere's what you should see if you are doing it for the first time:\n\n![](chrome-open-sources.svg)\n\nThe toggler button <span class=\"devtools\" style=\"background-position:-172px -98px\"></span> opens the tab with files.\n\nLet's click it and select `hello.js` in the tree view. Here's what should show up:\n\n![](chrome-tabs.svg)\n\nThe Sources panel has 3 parts:\n\n1. The **File Navigator** pane lists HTML, JavaScript, CSS and other files, including images that are attached to the page. Chrome extensions may appear here too.\n2. The **Code Editor** pane shows the source code.\n3. The **JavaScript Debugging** pane is for debugging, we'll explore it soon.\n\nNow you could click the same toggler <span class=\"devtools\" style=\"background-position:-172px -122px\"></span> again to hide the resources list and give the code some space.\n\n## Console\n\nIf we press `key:Esc`, then a console opens below. We can type commands there and press `key:Enter` to execute.\n\nAfter a statement is executed, its result is shown below.\n\nFor example, here `1+2` results in `3`, and `hello(\"debugger\")` returns nothing, so the result is `undefined`:\n\n![](chrome-sources-console.svg)\n\n## Breakpoints\n\nLet's examine what's going on within the code of the [example page](debugging/index.html). In `hello.js`, click at line number `4`. Yes, right on the `4` digit, not on the code.\n\nCongratulations! You've set a breakpoint. Please also click on the number for line `8`.\n\nIt should look like this (blue is where you should click):\n\n![](chrome-sources-breakpoint.svg)\n\nA *breakpoint* is a point of code where the debugger will automatically pause the JavaScript execution.\n\nWhile the code is paused, we can examine current variables, execute commands in the console etc. In other words, we can debug it.\n\nWe can always find a list of breakpoints in the right panel. That's useful when we have many breakpoints in various files. It allows us to:\n- Quickly jump to the breakpoint in the code (by clicking on it in the right panel).\n- Temporarily disable the breakpoint by unchecking it.\n- Remove the breakpoint by right-clicking and selecting Remove.\n- ...And so on.\n\n```smart header=\"Conditional breakpoints\"\n*Right click* on the line number allows to create a *conditional* breakpoint. It only triggers when the given expression is truthy.\n\nThat's handy when we need to stop only for a certain variable value or for certain function parameters.\n```\n\n## Debugger command\n\nWe can also pause the code by using the `debugger` command in it, like this:\n\n```js\nfunction hello(name) {\n  let phrase = `Hello, ${name}!`;\n\n*!*\n  debugger;  // <-- the debugger stops here\n*/!*\n\n  say(phrase);\n}\n```\n\nThat's very convenient when we are in a code editor and don't want to switch to the browser and look up the script in developer tools to set the breakpoint.\n\n\n## Pause and look around\n\nIn our example, `hello()` is called during the page load, so the easiest way to activate the debugger (after we've set the breakpoints) is to reload the page. So let's press `key:F5` (Windows, Linux) or `key:Cmd+R` (Mac).\n\nAs the breakpoint is set, the execution pauses at the 4th line:\n\n![](chrome-sources-debugger-pause.svg)\n\nPlease open the informational dropdowns to the right (labeled with arrows). They allow you to examine the current code state:\n\n1. **`Watch` -- shows current values for any expressions.**\n\n    You can click the plus `+` and input an expression. The debugger will show its value at any moment, automatically recalculating it in the process of execution.\n\n2. **`Call Stack` -- shows the nested calls chain.**\n\n    At the current moment the debugger is inside `hello()` call, called by a script in `index.html` (no function there, so it's called \"anonymous\").\n\n    If you click on a stack item (e.g. \"anonymous\"), the debugger jumps to the corresponding code, and all its variables can be examined as well.\n3. **`Scope` -- current variables.**\n\n    `Local` shows local function variables. You can also see their values highlighted right over the source.\n\n    `Global` has global variables (out of any functions).\n\n    There's also `this` keyword there that we didn't study yet, but we'll do that soon.\n\n## Tracing the execution\n\nNow it's time to *trace* the script.\n\nThere are buttons for it at the top of the right panel. Let's engage them.\n<!-- https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-frontend/blob/master/front_end/Images/src/largeIcons.svg -->\n<span class=\"devtools\" style=\"background-position:-146px -168px\"></span> -- \"Resume\": continue the execution, hotkey `key:F8`.\n: Resumes the execution. If there are no additional breakpoints, then the execution just continues and the debugger loses control.\n\n    Here's what we can see after a click on it:\n\n    ![](chrome-sources-debugger-trace-1.svg)\n\n    The execution has resumed, reached another breakpoint inside `say()` and paused there. Take a look at the \"Call Stack\" at the right. It has increased by one more call. We're inside `say()` now.\n\n<span class=\"devtools\" style=\"background-position:-200px -190px\"></span> -- \"Step\": run the next command, hotkey `key:F9`.\n: Run the next statement. If we click it now, `alert` will be shown.\n\n    Clicking this again and again will step through all script statements one by one.\n\n<span class=\"devtools\" style=\"background-position:-62px -192px\"></span> -- \"Step over\": run the next command, but *don't go into a function*, hotkey `key:F10`.\n: Similar to the previous the \"Step\" command, but behaves differently if the next statement is a function call. That is: not a built-in, like `alert`, but a function of our own.\n\n    The \"Step\" command goes into it and pauses the execution at its first line, while \"Step over\" executes the nested function call invisibly, skipping the function internals.\n\n    The execution is then paused immediately after that function.\n\n    That's good if we're not interested to see what happens inside the function call.\n\n<span class=\"devtools\" style=\"background-position:-4px -194px\"></span> -- \"Step into\", hotkey `key:F11`.\n: That's similar to \"Step\", but behaves differently in case of asynchronous function calls. If you're only starting to learn JavaScript, then you can ignore the difference, as we don't have asynchronous calls yet.\n\n    For the future, just note that \"Step\" command ignores async actions, such as `setTimeout` (scheduled function call), that execute later. The \"Step into\" goes into their code, waiting for them if necessary. See [DevTools manual](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/01/devtools#async) for more details.\n\n<span class=\"devtools\" style=\"background-position:-32px -194px\"></span> -- \"Step out\": continue the execution till the end of the current function, hotkey `key:Shift+F11`.\n: Continue the execution and stop it at the very last line of the current function. That's handy when we accidentally entered a nested call using <span class=\"devtools\" style=\"background-position:-200px -190px\"></span>, but it does not interest us, and we want to continue to its end as soon as possible.\n\n<span class=\"devtools\" style=\"background-position:-61px -74px\"></span> -- enable/disable all breakpoints.\n: That button does not move the execution. Just a mass on/off for breakpoints.\n\n<span class=\"devtools\" style=\"background-position:-90px -146px\"></span> -- enable/disable automatic pause in case of an error.\n: When enabled, and the developer tools is open, a script error automatically pauses the execution. Then we can analyze variables to see what went wrong. So if our script dies with an error, we can open debugger, enable this option and reload the page to see where it dies and what's the context at that moment.\n\n```smart header=\"Continue to here\"\nRight click on a line of code opens the context menu with a great option called \"Continue to here\".\n\nThat's handy when we want to move multiple steps forward to the line, but we're too lazy to set a breakpoint.\n```\n\n## Logging\n\nTo output something to console from our code, there's `console.log` function.\n\nFor instance, this outputs values from `0` to `4` to console:\n\n```js run\n// open console to see\nfor (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n  console.log(\"value,\", i);\n}\n```\n\nRegular users don't see that output, it is in the console. To see it, either open the Console panel of developer tools or press `key:Esc` while in another panel: that opens the console at the bottom.\n\nIf we have enough logging in our code, then we can see what's going on from the records, without the debugger.\n\n## Summary\n\nAs we can see, there are three main ways to pause a script:\n1. A breakpoint.\n2. The `debugger` statements.\n3. An error (if dev tools are open and the button <span class=\"devtools\" style=\"background-position:-90px -146px\"></span> is \"on\").\n\nWhen paused, we can debug - examine variables and trace the code to see where the execution goes wrong.\n\nThere are many more options in developer tools than covered here. The full manual is at <https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools>.\n\nThe information from this chapter is enough to begin debugging, but later, especially if you do a lot of browser stuff, please go there and look through more advanced capabilities of developer tools.\n\nOh, and also you can click at various places of dev tools and just see what's showing up. That's probably the fastest route to learn dev tools. Don't forget about the right click and context menus!",

        "content": "\n\nOur code must be as clean and easy to read as possible.\n\nThat is actually the art of programming -- to take a complex task and code it in a way that is both correct and human-readable. A good code style greatly assists in that.  \n\n## Syntax\n\nHere is a cheat sheet with some suggested rules (see below for more details):\n\n![](code-style.svg)\n<!--\n```js\nfunction pow(x, n) {\n  let result = 1;\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    result *= x;\n  }\n\n  return result;\n}\n\nlet x = prompt(\"x?\", \"\");\nlet n = prompt(\"n?\", \"\");\n\nif (n < 0) {\n  alert(`Power ${n} is not supported,\n    please enter a non-negative integer number`);\n} else {\n  alert( pow(x, n) );\n}\n```\n\n-->\n\nNow let's discuss the rules and reasons for them in detail.\n\n```warn header=\"There are no \\\"you must\\\" rules\"\nNothing is set in stone here. These are style preferences, not religious dogmas.\n```\n\n### Curly Braces\n\nIn most JavaScript projects curly braces are written in \"Egyptian\" style with the opening brace on the same line as the corresponding keyword -- not on a new line. There should also be a space before the opening bracket, like this:\n\n```js\nif (condition) {\n  // do this\n  // ...and that\n  // ...and that\n}\n```\n\nA single-line construct, such as `if (condition) doSomething()`, is an important edge case. Should we use braces at all?\n\nHere are the annotated variants so you can judge their readability for yourself:\n\n1. 😠 Beginners sometimes do that. Bad! Curly braces are not needed:\n    ```js\n    if (n < 0) *!*{*/!*alert(`Power ${n} is not supported`);*!*}*/!*\n    ```\n2. 😠 Split to a separate line without braces. Never do that, easy to make an error when adding new lines:\n    ```js\n    if (n < 0)\n      alert(`Power ${n} is not supported`);\n    ```\n3. 😏 One line without braces - acceptable, if it's short:\n    ```js\n    if (n < 0) alert(`Power ${n} is not supported`);\n    ```\n4. 😃 The best variant:\n    ```js\n    if (n < 0) {\n      alert(`Power ${n} is not supported`);\n    }\n    ```\n\nFor a very brief code, one line is allowed, e.g. `if (cond) return null`. But a code block (the last variant) is usually more readable.\n\n### Line Length\n\nNo one likes to read a long horizontal line of code. It's best practice to split them.\n\nFor example:\n```js\n// backtick quotes ` allow to split the string into multiple lines\nlet str = `\n  ECMA International's TC39 is a group of JavaScript developers,\n  implementers, academics, and more, collaborating with the community\n  to maintain and evolve the definition of JavaScript.\n`;\n```\n\nAnd, for `if` statements:\n\n```js\nif (\n  id === 123 &&\n  moonPhase === 'Waning Gibbous' &&\n  zodiacSign === 'Libra'\n) {\n  letTheSorceryBegin();\n}\n```\n\nThe maximum line length should be agreed upon at the team-level. It's usually 80 or 120 characters.\n\n### Indents\n\nThere are two types of indents:\n\n- **Horizontal indents: 2 or 4 spaces.**\n\n    A horizontal indentation is made using either 2 or 4 spaces or the horizontal tab symbol (key `key:Tab`). Which one to choose is an old holy war. Spaces are more common nowadays.\n\n    One advantage of spaces over tabs is that spaces allow more flexible configurations of indents than the tab symbol.\n\n    For instance, we can align the arguments with the opening bracket, like this:\n\n    ```js no-beautify\n    show(parameters,\n         aligned, // 5 spaces padding at the left  \n         one,\n         after,\n         another\n      ) {\n      // ...\n    }\n    ```\n\n- **Vertical indents: empty lines for splitting code into logical blocks.**\n\n    Even a single function can often be divided into logical blocks. In the example below, the initialization of variables, the main loop and returning the result are split vertically:\n\n    ```js\n    function pow(x, n) {\n      let result = 1;\n      //              <--\n      for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        result *= x;\n      }\n      //              <--\n      return result;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Insert an extra newline where it helps to make the code more readable. There should not be more than nine lines of code without a vertical indentation.\n\n### Semicolons\n\nA semicolon should be present after each statement, even if it could possibly be skipped.\n\nThere are languages where a semicolon is truly optional and it is rarely used. In JavaScript, though, there are cases where a line break is not interpreted as a semicolon, leaving the code vulnerable to errors. See more about that in the chapter <info:structure#semicolon>.\n\nIf you're an experienced JavaScript programmer, you may choose a no-semicolon code style like [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/). Otherwise, it's best to use semicolons to avoid possible pitfalls. The majority of developers put semicolons.\n\n### Nesting Levels\n\nTry to avoid nesting code too many levels deep.\n\nFor example, in the loop, it's sometimes a good idea to use the [`continue`](info:while-for#continue) directive to avoid extra nesting.\n\nFor example, instead of adding a nested `if` conditional like this:\n\n```js\nfor (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  if (cond) {\n    ... // <- one more nesting level\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe can write:\n\n```js\nfor (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  if (!cond) *!*continue*/!*;\n  ...  // <- no extra nesting level\n}\n```\n\nA similar thing can be done with `if/else` and `return`.\n\nFor example, two constructs below are identical.\n\nOption 1:\n\n```js\nfunction pow(x, n) {\n  if (n < 0) {\n    alert(\"Negative 'n' not supported\");\n  } else {\n    let result = 1;\n\n    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n      result *= x;\n    }\n\n    return result;\n  }  \n}\n```\n\nOption 2:\n\n```js\nfunction pow(x, n) {\n  if (n < 0) {\n    alert(\"Negative 'n' not supported\");\n    return;\n  }\n\n  let result = 1;\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    result *= x;\n  }\n\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\nThe second one is more readable because the \"special case\" of `n < 0` is handled early on. Once the check is done we can move on to the \"main\" code flow without the need for additional nesting.\n\n## Function Placement\n\nIf you are writing several \"helper\" functions and the code that uses them, there are three ways to organize the functions.\n\n1. Declare the functions *above* the code that uses them:\n\n    ```js\n    // *!*function declarations*/!*\n    function createElement() {\n      ...\n    }\n\n    function setHandler(elem) {\n      ...\n    }\n\n    function walkAround() {\n      ...\n    }\n\n    // *!*the code which uses them*/!*\n    let elem = createElement();\n    setHandler(elem);\n    walkAround();\n    ```\n2. Code first, then functions\n\n    ```js\n    // *!*the code which uses the functions*/!*\n    let elem = createElement();\n    setHandler(elem);\n    walkAround();\n\n    // --- *!*helper functions*/!* ---\n    function createElement() {\n      ...\n    }\n\n    function setHandler(elem) {\n      ...\n    }\n\n    function walkAround() {\n      ...\n    }\n    ```\n3. Mixed: a function is declared where it's first used.\n\nMost of time, the second variant is preferred.\n\nThat's because when reading code, we first want to know *what it does*. If the code goes first, then it becomes clear from the start. Then, maybe we won't need to read the functions at all, especially if their names are descriptive of what they actually do.\n\n## Style Guides\n\nA style guide contains general rules about \"how to write\" code, e.g. which quotes to use, how many spaces to indent, the maximal line length, etc. A lot of minor things.\n\nWhen all members of a team use the same style guide, the code looks uniform, regardless of which team member wrote it.\n\nOf course, a team can always write their own style guide, but usually there's no need to. There are many existing guides to choose from.\n\nSome popular choices:\n\n- [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)\n- [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)\n- [Idiomatic.JS](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js)\n- [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/)\n- (plus many more)\n\nIf you're a novice developer, start with the cheat sheet at the beginning of this chapter. Then you can browse other style guides to pick up more ideas and decide which one you like best.\n\n## Automated Linters\n\nLinters are tools that can automatically check the style of your code and make improving suggestions.\n\nThe great thing about them is that style-checking can also find some bugs, like typos in variable or function names. Because of this feature, using a linter is recommended even if you don't want to stick to one particular \"code style\".\n\nHere are some well-known linting tools:\n\n- [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) -- one of the first linters.\n- [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/) -- more settings than JSLint.\n- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) -- probably the newest one.\n\nAll of them can do the job. The author uses [ESLint](http://eslint.org/).\n\nMost linters are integrated with many popular editors: just enable the plugin in the editor and configure the style.\n\nFor instance, for ESLint you should do the following:\n\n1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).\n2. Install ESLint with the command `npm install -g eslint` (npm is a JavaScript package installer).\n3. Create a config file named `.eslintrc` in the root of your JavaScript project (in the folder that contains all your files).\n4. Install/enable the plugin for your editor that integrates with ESLint. The majority of editors have one.\n\nHere's an example of an `.eslintrc` file:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"extends\": \"eslint:recommended\",\n  \"env\": {\n    \"browser\": true,\n    \"node\": true,\n    \"es6\": true\n  },\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"no-console\": 0,\n    \"indent\": [\"warning\", 2]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere the directive `\"extends\"` denotes that the configuration is based on the \"eslint:recommended\" set of settings. After that, we specify our own.\n\nIt is also possible to download style rule sets from the web and extend them instead. See <http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started> for more details about installation.\n\nAlso certain IDEs have built-in linting, which is convenient but not as customizable as ESLint.\n\n## Summary\n\nAll syntax rules described in this chapter (and in the style guides referenced) aim to increase the readability of your code. All of them are debatable.\n\nWhen we think about writing \"better\" code, the questions we should ask ourselves are: \"What makes the code more readable and easier to understand?\" and \"What can help us avoid errors?\" These are the main things to keep in mind when choosing and debating code styles.\n\nReading popular style guides will allow you to keep up to date with the latest ideas about code style trends and best practices.",

        "isFolder": false,
        "weight": 3,
        "content": "\n\nAs we know from the chapter <info:structure>, comments can be single-line: starting with `//` and multiline: `/* ... */`.\n\nWe normally use them to describe how and why the code works.\n\nAt first sight, commenting might be obvious, but novices in programming often use them wrongly.\n\n## Bad comments\n\nNovices tend to use comments to explain \"what is going on in the code\". Like this:\n\n```js\n// This code will do this thing (...) and that thing (...)\n// ...and who knows what else...\nvery;\ncomplex;\ncode;\n```\n\nBut in good code, the amount of such \"explanatory\" comments should be minimal. Seriously, the code should be easy to understand without them.\n\nThere's a great rule about that: \"if the code is so unclear that it requires a comment, then maybe it should be rewritten instead\".\n\n### Recipe: factor out functions\n\nSometimes it's beneficial to replace a code piece with a function, like here:\n\n```js\nfunction showPrimes(n) {\n  nextPrime:\n  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {\n\n*!*\n    // check if i is a prime number\n    for (let j = 2; j < i; j++) {\n      if (i % j == 0) continue nextPrime;\n    }\n*/!*\n\n    alert(i);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe better variant, with a factored out function `isPrime`:\n\n\n```js\nfunction showPrimes(n) {\n\n  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {\n    *!*if (!isPrime(i)) continue;*/!*\n\n    alert(i);  \n  }\n}\n\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {\n    if (n % i == 0) return false;\n  }\n\n  return true;\n}\n```\n\nNow we can understand the code easily. The function itself becomes the comment. Such code is called *self-descriptive*.\n\n### Recipe: create functions\n\nAnd if we have a long \"code sheet\" like this:\n\n```js\n// here we add whiskey\nfor(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  let drop = getWhiskey();\n  smell(drop);\n  add(drop, glass);\n}\n\n// here we add juice\nfor(let t = 0; t < 3; t++) {\n  let tomato = getTomato();\n  examine(tomato);\n  let juice = press(tomato);\n  add(juice, glass);\n}\n\n// ...\n```\n\nThen it might be a better variant to refactor it into functions like:\n\n```js\naddWhiskey(glass);\naddJuice(glass);\n\nfunction addWhiskey(container) {\n  for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n    let drop = getWhiskey();\n    //...\n  }\n}\n\nfunction addJuice(container) {\n  for(let t = 0; t < 3; t++) {\n    let tomato = getTomato();\n    //...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOnce again, functions themselves tell what's going on. There's nothing to comment. And also the code structure is better when split. It's clear what every function does, what it takes and what it returns.\n\nIn reality, we can't totally avoid \"explanatory\" comments. There are complex algorithms. And there are smart \"tweaks\" for purposes of optimization. But generally we should try to keep the code simple and self-descriptive.\n\n## Good comments\n\nSo, explanatory comments are usually bad. Which comments are good?\n\nDescribe the architecture\n: Provide a high-level overview of components, how they interact, what's the control flow in various situations... In short -- the bird's eye view of the code. There's a special language [UML](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) to build high-level architecture diagrams explaining the code. Definitely worth studying.\n\nDocument function parameters and usage\n: There's a special syntax [JSDoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc) to document a function: usage, parameters, returned value.\n\nFor instance:\n```js\n/**\n * Returns x raised to the n-th power.\n *\n * @param {number} x The number to raise.\n * @param {number} n The power, must be a natural number.\n * @return {number} x raised to the n-th power.\n */\nfunction pow(x, n) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nSuch comments allow us to understand the purpose of the function and use it the right way without looking in its code.\n\nBy the way, many editors like [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) can understand them as well and use them to provide autocomplete and some automatic code-checking.\n\nAlso, there are tools like [JSDoc 3](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc) that can generate HTML-documentation from the comments. You can read more information about JSDoc at <http://usejsdoc.org/>.\n\nWhy is the task solved this way?\n: What's written is important. But what's *not* written may be even more important to understand what's going on. Why is the task solved exactly this way? The code gives no answer.\n\n    If there are many ways to solve the task, why this one? Especially when it's not the most obvious one.\n\n    Without such comments the following situation is possible:\n    1. You (or your colleague) open the code written some time ago, and see that it's \"suboptimal\".\n    2. You think: \"How stupid I was then, and how much smarter I'm now\", and rewrite using the \"more obvious and correct\" variant.\n    3. ...The urge to rewrite was good. But in the process you see that the \"more obvious\" solution is actually lacking. You even dimly remember why, because you already tried it long ago. You revert to the correct variant, but the time was wasted.\n\n    Comments that explain the solution are very important. They help to continue development the right way.\n\nAny subtle features of the code? Where they are used?\n: If the code has anything subtle and counter-intuitive, it's definitely worth commenting.\n\n## Summary\n\nAn important sign of a good developer is comments: their presence and even their absence.\n\nGood comments allow us to maintain the code well, come back to it after a delay and use it more effectively.\n\n**Comment this:**\n\n- Overall architecture, high-level view.\n- Function usage.\n- Important solutions, especially when not immediately obvious.\n\n**Avoid comments:**\n\n- That tell \"how code works\" and \"what it does\".\n- Put them in only if it's impossible to make the code so simple and self-descriptive that it doesn't require them.\n\nComments are also used for auto-documenting tools like JSDoc3: they read them and generate HTML-docs (or docs in another format).",

        "content": "\n\n\n```quote author=\"Confucius\"\nLearning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.\n```\n\nProgrammer ninjas of the past used these tricks to sharpen the mind of code maintainers.\n\nCode review gurus look for them in test tasks.\n\nNovice developers sometimes use them even better than programmer ninjas.\n\nRead them carefully and find out who you are -- a ninja, a novice, or maybe a code reviewer?\n\n\n```warn header=\"Irony detected\"\nMany try to follow ninja paths. Few succeed.\n```\n\n\n## Brevity is the soul of wit\n\nMake the code as short as possible. Show how smart you are.\n\nLet subtle language features guide you.\n\nFor instance, take a look at this ternary operator `'?'`:\n\n```js\n// taken from a well-known javascript library\ni = i ? i < 0 ? Math.max(0, len + i) : i : 0;\n```\n\nCool, right? If you write like that, a developer who comes across this line and tries to understand what is the value of `i` is going to have a merry time. Then come to you, seeking for an answer.\n\nTell them that shorter is always better. Initiate them into the paths of ninja.\n\n## One-letter variables\n\n```quote author=\"Laozi (Tao Te Ching)\"\nThe Dao hides in wordlessness. Only the Dao is well begun and well\ncompleted.\n```\n\nAnother way to code shorter is to use single-letter variable names everywhere. Like `a`, `b` or `c`.\n\nA short variable disappears in the code like a real ninja in the forest. No one will be able to find it using \"search\" of the editor. And even if someone does, they won't be able to \"decipher\" what the name `a` or `b` means.\n\n...But there's an exception. A real ninja will never use `i` as the counter in a `\"for\"` loop. Anywhere, but not here. Look around, there are many more exotic letters. For instance, `x` or `y`.\n\nAn exotic variable as a loop counter is especially cool if the loop body takes 1-2 pages (make it longer if you can). Then if someone looks deep inside the loop, they won't be able to quickly figure out that the variable named `x` is the loop counter.\n\n## Use abbreviations\n\nIf the team rules forbid the use of one-letter and vague names -- shorten them, make abbreviations.\n\nLike this:\n\n- `list` -> `lst`.\n- `userAgent` -> `ua`.\n- `browser` -> `brsr`.\n- ...etc\n\nOnly the one with truly good intuition will be able to understand such names. Try to shorten everything. Only a worthy person should be able to uphold the development of your code.\n\n## Soar high. Be abstract.\n\n```quote author=\"Laozi (Tao Te Ching)\"\nThe great square is cornerless<br>\nThe great vessel is last complete,<br>\nThe great note is rarified sound,<br>\nThe great image has no form.\n```\n\nWhile choosing a name try to use the most abstract word. Like `obj`, `data`, `value`, `item`, `elem` and so on.\n\n- **The ideal name for a variable is `data`.** Use it everywhere you can. Indeed, every variable holds *data*, right?\n\n    ...But what to do if `data` is already taken? Try `value`, it's also universal. After all, a variable eventually gets a *value*.\n\n- **Name a variable by its type: `str`, `num`...**\n\n    Give them a try. A young initiate may wonder -- are such names really useful for a ninja? Indeed, they are!\n\n    Sure, the variable name still means something. It says what's inside the variable: a string, a number or something else. But when an outsider tries to understand the code, they'll be surprised to see that there's actually no information at all! And will ultimately fail to alter your well-thought code.\n\n    The value type is easy to find out by debugging. But what's the meaning of the variable? Which string/number does it store?\n\n    There's just no way to figure out without a good meditation!\n\n- **...But what if there are no more such names?** Just add a number: `data1, item2, elem5`...\n\n## Attention test\n\nOnly a truly attentive programmer should be able to understand your code. But how to check that?\n\n**One of the ways -- use similar variable names, like `date` and `data`.**\n\nMix them where you can.\n\nA quick read of such code becomes impossible. And when there's a typo... Ummm... We're stuck for long, time to drink tea.\n\n\n## Smart synonyms\n\n```quote author=\"Confucius\"\nThe hardest thing of all is to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if there is no cat.\n```\n\nUsing *similar* names for *same* things makes life more interesting and shows your creativity to the public.\n\nFor instance, consider function prefixes. If a function shows a message on the screen -- start it with `display…`, like `displayMessage`. And then if another function shows on the screen something else, like a user name, start it with `show…` (like `showName`).\n\nInsinuate that there's a subtle difference between such functions, while there is none.\n\nMake a pact with fellow ninjas of the team: if John starts \"showing\" functions with `display...` in his code, then Peter could use `render..`, and Ann -- `paint...`. Note how much more interesting and diverse the code became.\n\n...And now the hat trick!\n\nFor two functions with important differences -- use the same prefix!\n\nFor instance, the function `printPage(page)` will use a printer. And the function `printText(text)` will put the text on-screen. Let an unfamiliar reader think well over similarly named function `printMessage`: \"Where does it put the message? To a printer or on the screen?\". To make it really shine, `printMessage(message)` should output it in the new window!\n\n## Reuse names\n\n```quote author=\"Laozi (Tao Te Ching)\"\nOnce the whole is divided, the parts<br>\nneed names.<br>\nThere are already enough names.<br>\nOne must know when to stop.\n```\n\nAdd a new variable only when absolutely necessary.\n\nInstead, reuse existing names. Just write new values into them.\n\nIn a function try to use only variables passed as parameters.\n\nThat would make it really hard to identify what's exactly in the variable *now*. And also where it comes from. The purpose is to develop the intuition and memory of a person reading the code. A person with weak intuition would have to analyze the code line-by-line and track the changes through every code branch.\n\n**An advanced variant of the approach is to covertly (!) replace the value with something alike in the middle of a loop or a function.**\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js\nfunction ninjaFunction(elem) {\n  // 20 lines of code working with elem\n\n  elem = clone(elem);\n\n  // 20 more lines, now working with the clone of the elem!\n}\n```\n\nA fellow programmer who wants to work with `elem` in the second half of the function will be surprised... Only during the debugging, after examining the code they will find out that they're working with a clone!\n\nSeen in code regularly. Deadly effective even against an experienced ninja.\n\n## Underscores for fun\n\nPut underscores `_` and `__` before variable names. Like `_name` or `__value`. It would be great if only you knew their meaning. Or, better, add them just for fun, without particular meaning at all. Or different meanings in different places.\n\nYou kill two rabbits with one shot. First, the code becomes longer and less readable, and the second, a fellow developer may spend a long time trying to figure out what the underscores mean.\n\nA smart ninja puts underscores at one spot of code and evades them at other places. That makes the code even more fragile and increases the probability of future errors.\n\n## Show your love\n\nLet everyone see how magnificent your entities are! Names like `superElement`, `megaFrame` and `niceItem` will definitely enlighten a reader.\n\nIndeed, from one hand, something is written: `super..`, `mega..`, `nice..` But from the other hand -- that brings no details. A reader may decide to look for a hidden meaning and meditate for an hour or two of their paid working time.\n\n\n## Overlap outer variables\n\n```quote author=\"Guan Yin Zi\"\nWhen in the light, can't see anything in the darkness.<br>\nWhen in the darkness, can see everything in the light.\n```\n\nUse same names for variables inside and outside a function. As simple. No efforts to invent new names.\n\n```js\nlet *!*user*/!* = authenticateUser();\n\nfunction render() {\n  let *!*user*/!* = anotherValue();\n  ...\n  ...many lines...\n  ...\n  ... // <-- a programmer wants to work with user here and...\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nA programmer who jumps inside the `render` will probably fail to notice that there's a local `user` shadowing the outer one.\n\nThen they'll try to work with `user` assuming that it's the external variable, the result of `authenticateUser()`... The trap is sprung! Hello, debugger...\n\n\n## Side-effects everywhere!\n\nThere are functions that look like they don't change anything. Like `isReady()`, `checkPermission()`, `findTags()`... They are assumed to carry out calculations, find and return the data, without changing anything outside of them. In other words, without \"side-effects\".\n\n**A really beautiful trick is to add a \"useful\" action to them, besides the main task.**\n\nAn expression of dazed surprise on the face of your colleague when they see a function named `is..`, `check..` or `find...` changing something -- will definitely broaden your boundaries of reason.\n\n**Another way to surprise is to return a non-standard result.**\n\nShow your original thinking! Let the call of `checkPermission` return not `true/false`, but a complex object with the results of the check.\n\nThose developers who try to write `if (checkPermission(..))`, will wonder why it doesn't work. Tell them: \"Read the docs!\". And give this article.\n\n\n## Powerful functions!\n\n```quote author=\"Laozi (Tao Te Ching)\"\nThe great Tao flows everywhere,<br>\nboth to the left and to the right.\n```\n\nDon't limit the function by what's written in its name. Be broader.\n\nFor instance, a function `validateEmail(email)` could (besides checking the email for correctness) show an error message and ask to re-enter the email.\n\nAdditional actions should not be obvious from the function name. A true ninja coder will make them not obvious from the code as well.\n\n**Joining several actions into one protects your code from reuse.**\n\nImagine, another developer wants only to check the email, and not output any message. Your function  `validateEmail(email)` that does both will not suit them. So they won't break your meditation by asking anything about it.\n\n## Summary\n\nAll \"pieces of advice\" above are from the real code... Sometimes, written by experienced developers. Maybe even more experienced than you are ;)\n\n- Follow some of them, and your code will become full of surprises.\n- Follow many of them, and your code will become truly yours, no one would want to change it.\n- Follow all, and your code will become a valuable lesson for young developers looking for enlightenment.",

        "content": "\n\nAutomated testing will be used in further tasks, and it's also widely used in real projects.\n\n## Why we need tests?\n\nWhen we write a function, we can usually imagine what it should do: which parameters give which results.\n\nDuring development, we can check the function by running it and comparing the outcome with the expected one. For instance, we can do it in the console.\n\nIf something is wrong -- then we fix the code, run again, check the result -- and so on till it works.\n\nBut such manual \"re-runs\" are imperfect.\n\n**When testing a code by manual re-runs, it's easy to miss something.**\n\nFor instance, we're creating a function `f`. Wrote some code, testing: `f(1)` works, but `f(2)` doesn't work. We fix the code and now `f(2)` works. Looks complete? But we forgot to re-test `f(1)`. That may lead to an error.\n\nThat's very typical. When we develop something, we keep a lot of possible use cases in mind. But it's hard to expect a programmer to check all of them manually after every change. So it becomes easy to fix one thing and break another one.\n\n**Automated testing means that tests are written separately, in addition to the code. They run our functions in various ways and compare results with the expected.**\n\n## Behavior Driven Development (BDD)\n\nLet's start with a technique named [Behavior Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) or, in short, BDD.\n\n**BDD is three things in one: tests AND documentation AND examples.**\n\nTo understand BDD, we'll examine a practical case of development.\n\n## Development of \"pow\": the spec\n\nLet's say we want to make a function `pow(x, n)` that raises `x` to an integer power `n`. We assume that `n≥0`.\n\nThat task is just an example: there's the `**` operator in JavaScript that can do that, but here we concentrate on the development flow that can be applied to more complex tasks as well.\n\nBefore creating the code of `pow`, we can imagine what the function should do and describe it.\n\nSuch description is called a *specification* or, in short, a spec, and contains descriptions of use cases together with tests for them, like this:\n\n```js\ndescribe(\"pow\", function() {\n\n  it(\"raises to n-th power\", function() {\n    assert.equal(pow(2, 3), 8);\n  });\n\n});\n```\n\nA spec has three main building blocks that you can see above:\n\n`describe(\"title\", function() { ... })`\n: What functionality we're describing. In our case we're describing the function `pow`. Used to group \"workers\" -- the `it` blocks.\n\n`it(\"use case description\", function() { ... })`\n: In the title of `it` we *in a human-readable way* describe the particular use case, and the second argument is a function that tests it.\n\n`assert.equal(value1, value2)`\n: The code inside `it` block, if the implementation is correct, should execute without errors.\n\n    Functions `assert.*` are used to check whether `pow` works as expected. Right here we're using one of them -- `assert.equal`, it compares arguments and yields an error if they are not equal. Here it checks that the result of `pow(2, 3)` equals `8`. There are other types of comparisons and checks, that we'll add later.\n\nThe specification can be executed, and it will run the test specified in `it` block. We'll see that later.\n\n## The development flow\n\nThe flow of development usually looks like this:\n\n1. An initial spec is written, with tests for the most basic functionality.\n2. An initial implementation is created.\n3. To check whether it works, we run the testing framework [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) (more details soon) that runs the spec. While the functionality is not complete, errors are displayed. We make corrections until everything works.\n4. Now we have a working initial implementation with tests.\n5. We add more use cases to the spec, probably not yet supported by the implementations. Tests start to fail.\n6. Go to 3, update the implementation till tests give no errors.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 till the functionality is ready.\n\nSo, the development is *iterative*. We write the spec, implement it, make sure tests pass, then write more tests, make sure they work etc. At the end we have both a working implementation and tests for it.\n\nLet's see this development flow in our practical case.\n\nThe first step is already complete: we have an initial spec for `pow`. Now, before making the implementation, let's use few JavaScript libraries to run the tests, just to see that they are working (they will all fail).\n\n## The spec in action\n\nHere in the tutorial we'll be using the following JavaScript libraries for tests:\n\n- [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) -- the core framework: it provides common testing functions including `describe` and `it` and the main function that runs tests.\n- [Chai](http://chaijs.com) -- the library with many assertions. It allows to use a lot of different assertions, for now we need only `assert.equal`.\n- [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) -- a library to spy over functions, emulate built-in functions and more, we'll need it much later.\n\nThese libraries are suitable for both in-browser and server-side testing. Here we'll consider the browser variant.\n\nThe full HTML page with these frameworks and `pow` spec:\n\n```html src=\"index.html\"\n```\n\nThe page can be divided into five parts:\n\n1. The `<head>` -- add third-party libraries and styles for tests.\n2. The `<script>` with the function to test, in our case -- with the code for `pow`.\n3. The tests -- in our case an external script `test.js` that has `describe(\"pow\", ...)` from above.\n4. The HTML element `<div id=\"mocha\">` will be used by Mocha to output results.\n5. The tests are started by the command `mocha.run()`.\n\nThe result:\n\n[iframe height=250 src=\"pow-1\" border=1 edit]\n\nAs of now, the test fails, there's an error. That's logical: we have an empty function code in `pow`, so `pow(2,3)` returns `undefined` instead of `8`.\n\nFor the future, let's note that there are more high-level test-runners, like [karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/) and others, that make it easy to autorun many different tests.\n\n## Initial implementation\n\nLet's make a simple implementation of `pow`, for tests to pass:\n\n```js\nfunction pow(x, n) {\n  return 8; // :) we cheat!\n}\n```\n\nWow, now it works!\n\n[iframe height=250 src=\"pow-min\" border=1 edit]\n\n## Improving the spec\n\nWhat we've done is definitely a cheat. The function does not work: an attempt to calculate `pow(3,4)` would give an incorrect result, but tests pass.\n\n...But the situation is quite typical, it happens in practice. Tests pass, but the function works wrong. Our spec is imperfect. We need to add more use cases to it.\n\nLet's add one more test to check that `pow(3, 4) = 81`.\n\nWe can select one of two ways to organize the test here:\n\n1. The first variant -- add one more `assert` into the same `it`:\n\n    ```js\n    describe(\"pow\", function() {\n\n      it(\"raises to n-th power\", function() {\n        assert.equal(pow(2, 3), 8);\n    *!*\n        assert.equal(pow(3, 4), 81);\n    */!*\n      });\n\n    });\n    ```\n2. The second -- make two tests:\n\n    ```js\n    describe(\"pow\", function() {\n\n      it(\"2 raised to power 3 is 8\", function() {\n        assert.equal(pow(2, 3), 8);\n      });\n\n      it(\"3 raised to power 4 is 81\", function() {\n        assert.equal(pow(3, 4), 81);\n      });\n\n    });\n    ```\n\nThe principal difference is that when `assert` triggers an error, the `it` block immediately terminates. So, in the first variant if the first `assert` fails, then we'll never see the result of the second `assert`.\n\nMaking tests separate is useful to get more information about what's going on, so the second variant is better.\n\nAnd besides that, there's one more rule that's good to follow.\n\n**One test checks one thing.**\n\nIf we look at the test and see two independent checks in it, it's better to split it into two simpler ones.\n\nSo let's continue with the second variant.\n\nThe result:\n\n[iframe height=250 src=\"pow-2\" edit border=\"1\"]\n\nAs we could expect, the second test failed. Sure, our function always returns `8`, while the `assert` expects `81`.\n\n## Improving the implementation\n\nLet's write something more real for tests to pass:\n\n```js\nfunction pow(x, n) {\n  let result = 1;\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    result *= x;\n  }\n\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\nTo be sure that the function works well, let's test it for more values. Instead of writing `it` blocks manually, we can generate them in `for`:\n\n```js\ndescribe(\"pow\", function() {\n\n  function makeTest(x) {\n    let expected = x * x * x;\n    it(`${x} in the power 3 is ${expected}`, function() {\n      assert.equal(pow(x, 3), expected);\n    });\n  }\n\n  for (let x = 1; x <= 5; x++) {\n    makeTest(x);\n  }\n\n});\n```\n\nThe result:\n\n[iframe height=250 src=\"pow-3\" edit border=\"1\"]\n\n## Nested describe\n\nWe're going to add even more tests. But before that let's note that the helper function `makeTest` and `for` should be grouped together. We won't need `makeTest` in other tests, it's needed only in `for`: their common task is to check how `pow` raises into the given power.\n\nGrouping is done with a nested `describe`:\n\n```js\ndescribe(\"pow\", function() {\n\n*!*\n  describe(\"raises x to power 3\", function() {\n*/!*\n\n    function makeTest(x) {\n      let expected = x * x * x;\n      it(`${x} in the power 3 is ${expected}`, function() {\n        assert.equal(pow(x, 3), expected);\n      });\n    }\n\n    for (let x = 1; x <= 5; x++) {\n      makeTest(x);\n    }\n\n*!*\n  });\n*/!*\n\n  // ... more tests to follow here, both describe and it can be added\n});\n```\n\nThe nested `describe` defines a new \"subgroup\" of tests. In the output we can see the titled indentation:\n\n[iframe height=250 src=\"pow-4\" edit border=\"1\"]\n\nIn the future we can add more `it` and `describe` on the top level with helper functions of their own, they won't see `makeTest`.\n\n````smart header=\"`before/after` and `beforeEach/afterEach`\"\nWe can setup `before/after` functions that execute before/after running tests, and also `beforeEach/afterEach` functions that execute before/after *every* `it`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js no-beautify\ndescribe(\"test\", function() {\n\n  before(() => alert(\"Testing started – before all tests\"));\n  after(() => alert(\"Testing finished – after all tests\"));\n\n  beforeEach(() => alert(\"Before a test – enter a test\"));\n  afterEach(() => alert(\"After a test – exit a test\"));\n\n  it('test 1', () => alert(1));\n  it('test 2', () => alert(2));\n\n});\n```\n\nThe running sequence will be:\n\n```\nTesting started – before all tests (before)\nBefore a test – enter a test (beforeEach)\n1\nAfter a test – exit a test   (afterEach)\nBefore a test – enter a test (beforeEach)\n2\nAfter a test – exit a test   (afterEach)\nTesting finished – after all tests (after)\n```\n\n[edit src=\"beforeafter\" title=\"Open the example in the sandbox.\"]\n\nUsually, `beforeEach/afterEach` and `before/after` are used to perform initialization, zero out counters or do something else between the tests (or test groups).\n````\n\n## Extending the spec\n\nThe basic functionality of `pow` is complete. The first iteration of the development is done. When we're done celebrating and drinking champagne -- let's go on and improve it.\n\nAs it was said, the function `pow(x, n)` is meant to work with positive integer values `n`.\n\nTo indicate a mathematical error, JavaScript functions usually return `NaN`. Let's do the same for invalid values of `n`.\n\nLet's first add the behavior to the spec(!):\n\n```js\ndescribe(\"pow\", function() {\n\n  // ...\n\n  it(\"for negative n the result is NaN\", function() {\n*!*\n    assert.isNaN(pow(2, -1));\n*/!*\n  });\n\n  it(\"for non-integer n the result is NaN\", function() {\n*!*\n    assert.isNaN(pow(2, 1.5));    \n*/!*\n  });\n\n});\n```\n\nThe result with new tests:\n\n[iframe height=530 src=\"pow-nan\" edit border=\"1\"]\n\nThe newly added tests fail, because our implementation does not support them. That's how BDD is done: first we write failing tests, and then make an implementation for them.\n\n```smart header=\"Other assertions\"\nPlease note the assertion `assert.isNaN`: it checks for `NaN`.\n\nThere are other assertions in [Chai](http://chaijs.com) as well, for instance:\n\n- `assert.equal(value1, value2)` -- checks the equality  `value1 == value2`.\n- `assert.strictEqual(value1, value2)` -- checks the strict equality `value1 === value2`.\n- `assert.notEqual`, `assert.notStrictEqual` -- inverse checks to the ones above.\n- `assert.isTrue(value)` -- checks that `value === true`\n- `assert.isFalse(value)` -- checks that `value === false`\n- ...the full list is in the [docs](http://chaijs.com/api/assert/)\n```\n\nSo we should add a couple of lines to `pow`:\n\n```js\nfunction pow(x, n) {\n*!*\n  if (n < 0) return NaN;\n  if (Math.round(n) != n) return NaN;\n*/!*\n\n  let result = 1;\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    result *= x;\n  }\n\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\nNow it works, all tests pass:\n\n[iframe height=300 src=\"pow-full\" edit border=\"1\"]\n\n[edit src=\"pow-full\" title=\"Open the full final example in the sandbox.\"]\n\n## Summary\n\nIn BDD, the spec goes first, followed by implementation. At the end we have both the spec and the code.\n\nThe spec can be used in three ways:\n\n1. As **Tests** - they guarantee that the code works correctly.\n2. As **Docs** -- the titles of `describe` and `it` tell what the function does.\n3. As **Examples** -- the tests are actually working examples showing how a function can be used.\n\nWith the spec, we can safely improve, change, even rewrite the function from scratch and make sure it still works right.\n\nThat's especially important in large projects when a function is used in many places. When we change such a function, there's just no way to manually check if every place that uses it still works right.\n\nWithout tests, people have two ways:\n\n1. To perform the change, no matter what. And then our users meet bugs, as we probably fail to check something manually.\n2. Or, if the punishment for errors is harsh, as there are no tests, people become afraid to modify such functions, and then the code becomes outdated, no one wants to get into it. Not good for development.\n\n**Automatic testing helps to avoid these problems!**\n\nIf the project is covered with tests, there's just no such problem. After any changes, we can run tests and see a lot of checks made in a matter of seconds.\n\n**Besides, a well-tested code has better architecture.**\n\nNaturally, that's because auto-tested code is easier to modify and improve. But there's also another reason.\n\nTo write tests, the code should be organized in such a way that every function has a clearly described task, well-defined input and output. That means a good architecture from the beginning.\n\nIn real life that's sometimes not that easy. Sometimes it's difficult to write a spec before the actual code, because it's not yet clear how it should behave. But in general writing tests makes development faster and more stable.\n\nLater in the tutorial you will meet many tasks with tests baked-in. So you'll see more practical examples.\n\nWriting tests requires good JavaScript knowledge. But we're just starting to learn it. So, to settle down everything, as of now you're not required to write tests, but you should already be able to read them even if they are a little bit more complex than in this chapter.",

        "solution": "The test demonstrates one of the temptations a developer meets when writing tests.\n\nWhat we have here is actually 3 tests, but layed out as a single function with 3 asserts.\n\nSometimes it's easier to write this way, but if an error occurs, it's much less obvious what went wrong.\n\nIf an error happens in the middle of a complex execution flow, then we'll have to figure out the data at that point. We'll actually have to *debug the test*.\n\nIt would be much better to break the test into multiple `it` blocks with clearly written inputs and outputs.\n\nLike this:\n```js\ndescribe(\"Raises x to power n\", function() {\n  it(\"5 in the power of 1 equals 5\", function() {\n    assert.equal(pow(5, 1), 5);\n  });\n\n  it(\"5 in the power of 2 equals 25\", function() {\n    assert.equal(pow(5, 2), 25);\n  });\n\n  it(\"5 in the power of 3 equals 125\", function() {\n    assert.equal(pow(5, 3), 125);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nWe replaced the single `it` with `describe` and a group of `it` blocks. Now if something fails we would see clearly what the data was.\n\nAlso we can isolate a single test and run it in standalone mode by writing `it.only` instead of `it`:\n\n\n```js\ndescribe(\"Raises x to power n\", function() {\n  it(\"5 in the power of 1 equals 5\", function() {\n    assert.equal(pow(5, 1), 5);\n  });\n\n*!*\n  // Mocha will run only this block\n  it.only(\"5 in the power of 2 equals 25\", function() {\n    assert.equal(pow(5, 2), 25);\n  });\n*/!*\n\n  it(\"5 in the power of 3 equals 125\", function() {\n    assert.equal(pow(5, 3), 125);\n  });\n});\n```",

New proposals to the language appear regularly, they are analyzed and, if considered worthy, are appended to the list at <https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/> and then progress to the [specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm).\n\nTeams behind JavaScript engines have their own ideas about what to implement first. They may decide to implement proposals that are in draft and postpone things that are already in the spec, because they are less interesting or just harder to do.\n\nSo it's quite common for an engine to implement only the part of the standard.\n\nA good page to see the current state of support for language features is <https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/> (it's big, we have a lot to study yet).\n\n## Babel\n\nWhen we use modern features of the language, some engines may fail to support such code. Just as said, not all features are implemented everywhere.\n\nHere Babel comes to the rescue.\n\n[Babel](https://babeljs.io) is a [transpiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler). It rewrites modern JavaScript code into the previous standard.\n\nActually, there are two parts in Babel:\n\n1. First, the transpiler program, which rewrites the code. The developer runs it on their own computer. It rewrites the code into the older standard. And then the code is delivered to the website for users. Modern project build systems like [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) provide means to run transpiler automatically on every code change, so that it's very easy to integrate into development process.\n\n2. Second, the polyfill.\n\n    New language features may include new built-in functions and syntax constructs.\n    The transpiler rewrites the code, transforming syntax constructs into older ones. But as for new built-in functions, we need to implement them. JavaScript is a highly dynamic language, scripts may add/modify any functions, so that they behave according to the modern standard.\n\n    A script that updates/adds new functions is called \"polyfill\". It \"fills in\" the gap and adds missing implementations.\n\n    Two interesting polyfills are:\n    - [core js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) that supports a lot, allows to include only needed features.\n    - [polyfill.io](http://polyfill.io) service that provides a script with polyfills, depending on the features and user's browser.\n\nSo, if we're going to use modern language features, a transpiler and a polyfill are necessary.\n\n## Examples in the tutorial\n\n\n````online\nMost examples are runnable at-place, like this:\n\n```js run\nalert('Press the \"Play\" button in the upper-right corner to run');\n```\n\nExamples that use modern JS will work only if your browser supports it.\n````\n\n```offline\nAs you're reading the offline version, in PDF examples are not runnable. In EPUB some of them can run.\n```\n\nGoogle Chrome is usually the most up-to-date with language features, good to run bleeding-edge demos without any transpilers, but other modern browsers also work fine.",

        "content": "\n\nAs we know from the chapter <info:types>, there are eight data types in JavaScript. Seven of them are called \"primitive\", because their values contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever).\n\nIn contrast, objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. In JavaScript, objects penetrate almost every aspect of the language. So we must understand them first before going in-depth anywhere else.\n\nAn object can be created with figure brackets `{…}` with an optional list of *properties*. A property is a \"key: value\" pair, where `key` is a string (also called a \"property name\"), and `value` can be anything.\n\nWe can imagine an object as a cabinet with signed files. Every piece of data is stored in its file by the key. It's easy to find a file by its name or add/remove a file.\n\n![](object.svg)\n\nAn empty object (\"empty cabinet\") can be created using one of two syntaxes:\n\n```js\nlet user = new Object(); // \"object constructor\" syntax\nlet user = {};  // \"object literal\" syntax\n```\n\n![](object-user-empty.svg)\n\nUsually, the figure brackets `{...}` are used. That declaration is called an *object literal*.\n\n## Literals and properties\n\nWe can immediately put some properties into `{...}` as \"key: value\" pairs:\n\n```js\nlet user = {     // an object\n  name: \"John\",  // by key \"name\" store value \"John\"\n  age: 30        // by key \"age\" store value 30\n};\n```\n\nA property has a key (also known as \"name\" or \"identifier\") before the colon `\":\"` and a value to the right of it.\n\nIn the `user` object, there are two properties:\n\n1. The first property has the name `\"name\"` and the value `\"John\"`.\n2. The second one has the name `\"age\"` and the value `30`.\n\nThe resulting `user` object can be imagined as a cabinet with two signed files labeled \"name\" and \"age\".\n\n![user object](object-user.svg)\n\nWe can add, remove and read files from it any time.\n\nProperty values are accessible using the dot notation:\n\n```js\n// get property values of the object:\nalert( user.name ); // John\nalert( user.age ); // 30\n```\n\nThe value can be of any type. Let's add a boolean one:\n\n```js\nuser.isAdmin = true;\n```\n\n![user object 2](object-user-isadmin.svg)\n\nTo remove a property, we can use `delete` operator:\n\n```js\ndelete user.age;\n```\n\n![user object 3](object-user-delete.svg)\n\nWe can also use multiword property names, but then they must be quoted:\n\n```js\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30,\n  \"likes birds\": true  // multiword property name must be quoted\n};\n```\n\n![](object-user-props.svg)\n\n\nThe last property in the list may end with a comma:\n```js\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30*!*,*/!*\n}\n```\nThat is called a \"trailing\" or \"hanging\" comma. Makes it easier to add/remove/move around properties, because all lines become alike.\n\n````smart header=\"Object with const can be changed\"\nPlease note: an object declared as `const` *can* be modified.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nconst user = {\n  name: \"John\"\n};\n\n*!*\nuser.name = \"Pete\"; // (*)\n*/!*\n\nalert(user.name); // Pete\n```\n\nIt might seem that the line `(*)` would cause an error, but no. The `const` fixes the value of `user`, but not its contents.\n\nThe `const` would give an error only if we try to set `user=...` as a whole.\n\nThere's another way to make constant object properties, we'll cover it later in the chapter <info:property-descriptors>.\n````\n\n## Square brackets\n\nFor multiword properties, the dot access doesn't work:\n\n```js run\n// this would give a syntax error\nuser.likes birds = true\n```\n\nJavaScript doesn't understand that. It thinks that we address `user.likes`, and then gives a syntax error when comes across unexpected `birds`.\n\nThe dot requires the key to be a valid variable identifier. That implies: contains no spaces, doesn't start with a digit and doesn't include special characters (`$` and `_` are allowed).\n\nThere's an alternative \"square bracket notation\" that works with any string:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {};\n\n// set\nuser[\"likes birds\"] = true;\n\n// get\nalert(user[\"likes birds\"]); // true\n\n// delete\ndelete user[\"likes birds\"];\n```\n\nNow everything is fine. Please note that the string inside the brackets is properly quoted (any type of quotes will do).\n\nSquare brackets also provide a way to obtain the property name as the result of any expression -- as opposed to a literal string -- like from a variable as follows:\n\n```js\nlet key = \"likes birds\";\n\n// same as user[\"likes birds\"] = true;\nuser[key] = true;\n```\n\nHere, the variable `key` may be calculated at run-time or depend on the user input. And then we use it to access the property. That gives us a great deal of flexibility.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30\n};\n\nlet key = prompt(\"What do you want to know about the user?\", \"name\");\n\n// access by variable\nalert( user[key] ); // John (if enter \"name\")\n```\n\nThe dot notation cannot be used in a similar way:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30\n};\n\nlet key = \"name\";\nalert( user.key ) // undefined\n```\n\n### Computed properties\n\nWe can use square brackets in an object literal, when creating an object. That's called *computed properties*.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet fruit = prompt(\"Which fruit to buy?\", \"apple\");\n\nlet bag = {\n*!*\n  [fruit]: 5, // the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit\n*/!*\n};\n\nalert( bag.apple ); // 5 if fruit=\"apple\"\n```\n\nThe meaning of a computed property is simple: `[fruit]` means that the property name should be taken from `fruit`.\n\nSo, if a visitor enters `\"apple\"`, `bag` will become `{apple: 5}`.\n\nEssentially, that works the same as:\n```js run\nlet fruit = prompt(\"Which fruit to buy?\", \"apple\");\nlet bag = {};\n\n// take property name from the fruit variable\nbag[fruit] = 5;\n```\n\n...But looks nicer.\n\nWe can use more complex expressions inside square brackets:\n\n```js\nlet fruit = 'apple';\nlet bag = {\n  [fruit + 'Computers']: 5 // bag.appleComputers = 5\n};\n```\n\nSquare brackets are much more powerful than the dot notation. They allow any property names and variables. But they are also more cumbersome to write.\n\nSo most of the time, when property names are known and simple, the dot is used. And if we need something more complex, then we switch to square brackets.\n\n## Property value shorthand\n\nIn real code we often use existing variables as values for property names.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nfunction makeUser(name, age) {\n  return {\n    name: name,\n    age: age,\n    // ...other properties\n  };\n}\n\nlet user = makeUser(\"John\", 30);\nalert(user.name); // John\n```\n\nIn the example above, properties have the same names as variables. The use-case of making a property from a variable is so common, that there's a special *property value shorthand* to make it shorter.\n\nInstead of `name:name` we can just write `name`, like this:\n\n```js\nfunction makeUser(name, age) {\n*!*\n  return {\n    name, // same as name: name\n    age,  // same as age: age\n    // ...\n  };\n*/!*\n}\n```\n\nWe can use both normal properties and shorthands in the same object:\n\n```js\nlet user = {\n  name,  // same as name:name\n  age: 30\n};\n```\n\n\n## Property names limitations\n\nAs we already know, a variable cannot have a name equal to one of language-reserved words like \"for\", \"let\", \"return\" etc.\n\nBut for an object property, there's no such restriction:\n\n```js run\n// these properties are all right\nlet obj = {\n  for: 1,\n  let: 2,\n  return: 3\n};\n\nalert( obj.for + obj.let + obj.return );  // 6\n```\n\nIn short, there are no limitations on property names. They can be any strings or symbols (a special type for identifiers, to be covered later).\n\nOther types are automatically converted to strings.\n\nFor instance, a number `0` becomes a string `\"0\"` when used as a property key:\n\n```js run\nlet obj = {\n  0: \"test\" // same as \"0\": \"test\"\n};\n\n// both alerts access the same property (the number 0 is converted to string \"0\")\nalert( obj[\"0\"] ); // test\nalert( obj[0] ); // test (same property)\n```\n\nThere's a minor gotcha with a special property named `__proto__`. We can't set it to a non-object value:\n\n```js run\nlet obj = {};\nobj.__proto__ = 5; // assign a number\nalert(obj.__proto__); // [object Object] - the value is an object, didn't work as intended\n```\n\nAs we see from the code, the assignment to a primitive `5` is ignored.\n\nWe'll cover the special nature of `__proto__` in [subsequent chapters](info:prototype-inheritance), and suggest the [ways to fix](info:prototype-methods) such behavior.\n\n## Property existence test, \"in\" operator\n\nA notable feature of objects in JavaScript, compared to many other languages, is that it's possible to access any property. There will be no error if the property doesn't exist!\n\nReading a non-existing property just returns `undefined`. So we can easily test whether the property exists:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {};\n\nalert( user.noSuchProperty === undefined ); // true means \"no such property\"\n```\n\nThere's also a special operator `\"in\"` for that.\n\nThe syntax is:\n```js\n\"key\" in object\n```\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet user = { name: \"John\", age: 30 };\n\nalert( \"age\" in user ); // true, user.age exists\nalert( \"blabla\" in user ); // false, user.blabla doesn't exist\n```\n\nPlease note that on the left side of `in` there must be a *property name*. That's usually a quoted string.\n\nIf we omit quotes, that means a variable, it should contain the actual name to be tested. For instance:\n\n```js run\nlet user = { age: 30 };\n\nlet key = \"age\";\nalert( *!*key*/!* in user ); // true, property \"age\" exists\n```\n\nWhy does the `in` operator exist? Isn't it enough to compare against `undefined`?\n\nWell, most of the time the comparison with `undefined` works fine. But there's a special case when it fails, but `\"in\"` works correctly.\n\nIt's when an object property exists, but stores `undefined`:\n\n```js run\nlet obj = {\n  test: undefined\n};\n\nalert( obj.test ); // it's undefined, so - no such property?\n\nalert( \"test\" in obj ); // true, the property does exist!\n```\n\nIn the code above, the property `obj.test` technically exists. So the `in` operator works right.\n\nSituations like this happen very rarely, because `undefined` should not be explicitly assigned. We mostly use `null` for \"unknown\" or \"empty\" values. So the `in` operator is an exotic guest in the code.\n\n\n## The \"for..in\" loop\n\nTo walk over all keys of an object, there exists a special form of the loop: `for..in`. This is a completely different thing from the `for(;;)` construct that we studied before.\n\nThe syntax:\n\n```js\nfor (key in object) {\n  // executes the body for each key among object properties\n}\n```\n\nFor instance, let's output all properties of `user`:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30,\n  isAdmin: true\n};\n\nfor (let key in user) {\n  // keys\n  alert( key );  // name, age, isAdmin\n  // values for the keys\n  alert( user[key] ); // John, 30, true\n}\n```\n\nNote that all \"for\" constructs allow us to declare the looping variable inside the loop, like `let key` here.\n\nAlso, we could use another variable name here instead of `key`. For instance, `\"for (let prop in obj)\"` is also widely used.\n\n### Ordered like an object\n\nAre objects ordered? In other words, if we loop over an object, do we get all properties in the same order they were added? Can we rely on this?\n\nThe short answer is: \"ordered in a special fashion\": integer properties are sorted, others appear in creation order. The details follow.\n\nAs an example, let's consider an object with the phone codes:\n\n```js run\nlet codes = {\n  \"49\": \"Germany\",\n  \"41\": \"Switzerland\",\n  \"44\": \"Great Britain\",\n  // ..,\n  \"1\": \"USA\"\n};\n\n*!*\nfor (let code in codes) {\n  alert(code); // 1, 41, 44, 49\n}\n*/!*\n```\n\nThe object may be used to suggest a list of options to the user. If we're making a site mainly for German audience then we probably want `49` to be the first.\n\nBut if we run the code, we see a totally different picture:\n\n- USA (1) goes first\n- then Switzerland (41) and so on.\n\nThe phone codes go in the ascending sorted order, because they are integers. So we see `1, 41, 44, 49`.\n\n````smart header=\"Integer properties? What's that?\"\nThe \"integer property\" term here means a string that can be converted to-and-from an integer without a change.\n\nSo, \"49\" is an integer property name, because when it's transformed to an integer number and back, it's still the same. But \"+49\" and \"1.2\" are not:\n\n```js run\n// Math.trunc is a built-in function that removes the decimal part\nalert( String(Math.trunc(Number(\"49\"))) ); // \"49\", same, integer property\nalert( String(Math.trunc(Number(\"+49\"))) ); // \"49\", not same \"+49\" ⇒ not integer property\nalert( String(Math.trunc(Number(\"1.2\"))) ); // \"1\", not same \"1.2\" ⇒ not integer property\n```\n````\n\n...On the other hand, if the keys are non-integer, then they are listed in the creation order, for instance:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  surname: \"Smith\"\n};\nuser.age = 25; // add one more\n\n*!*\n// non-integer properties are listed in the creation order\n*/!*\nfor (let prop in user) {\n  alert( prop ); // name, surname, age\n}\n```\n\nSo, to fix the issue with the phone codes, we can \"cheat\" by making the codes non-integer. Adding a plus `\"+\"` sign before each code is enough.\n\nLike this:\n\n```js run\nlet codes = {\n  \"+49\": \"Germany\",\n  \"+41\": \"Switzerland\",\n  \"+44\": \"Great Britain\",\n  // ..,\n  \"+1\": \"USA\"\n};\n\nfor (let code in codes) {\n  alert( +code ); // 49, 41, 44, 1\n}\n```\n\nNow it works as intended.\n\n## Summary\n\nObjects are associative arrays with several special features.\n\nThey store properties (key-value pairs), where:\n- Property keys must be strings or symbols (usually strings).\n- Values can be of any type.\n\nTo access a property, we can use:\n- The dot notation: `obj.property`.\n- Square brackets notation `obj[\"property\"]`. Square brackets allow to take the key from a variable, like `obj[varWithKey]`.\n\nAdditional operators:\n- To delete a property: `delete obj.prop`.\n- To check if a property with the given key exists: `\"key\" in obj`.\n- To iterate over an object: `for (let key in obj)` loop.\n\nWhat we've studied in this chapter is called a \"plain object\", or just `Object`.\n\nThere are many other kinds of objects in JavaScript:\n\n- `Array` to store ordered data collections,\n- `Date` to store the information about the date and time,\n- `Error` to store the information about an error.\n- ...And so on.\n\nThey have their special features that we'll study later. Sometimes people say something like \"Array type\" or \"Date type\", but formally they are not types of their own, but belong to a single \"object\" data type. And they extend it in various ways.\n\nObjects in JavaScript are very powerful. Here we've just scratched the surface of a topic that is really huge. We'll be closely working with objects and learning more about them in further parts of the tutorial.",

        "content": "\n\nOne of the fundamental differences of objects vs primitives is that they are stored and copied \"by reference\".\n\nPrimitive values: strings, numbers, booleans -- are assigned/copied \"as a whole value\".\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js\nlet message = \"Hello!\";\nlet phrase = message;\n```\n\nAs a result we have two independent variables, each one is storing the string `\"Hello!\"`.\n\n![](variable-copy-value.svg)\n\nObjects are not like that.\n\n**A variable stores not the object itself, but its \"address in memory\", in other words \"a reference\" to it.**\n\nHere's the picture for the object:\n\n```js\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\"\n};\n```\n\n![](variable-contains-reference.svg)\n\nHere, the object is stored somewhere in memory. And the variable `user` has a \"reference\" to it.\n\n**When an object variable is copied -- the reference is copied, the object is not duplicated.**\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js no-beautify\nlet user = { name: \"John\" };\n\nlet admin = user; // copy the reference\n```\n\nNow we have two variables, each one with the reference to the same object:\n\n![](variable-copy-reference.svg)\n\nWe can use any variable to access the object and modify its contents:\n\n```js run\nlet user = { name: 'John' };\n\nlet admin = user;\n\n*!*\nadmin.name = 'Pete'; // changed by the \"admin\" reference\n*/!*\n\nalert(*!*user.name*/!*); // 'Pete', changes are seen from the \"user\" reference\n```\n\nThe example above demonstrates that there is only one object. As if we had a cabinet with two keys and used one of them (`admin`) to get into it. Then, if we later use another key (`user`) we can see changes.\n\n## Comparison by reference\n\nThe equality `==` and strict equality `===` operators for objects work exactly the same.\n\n**Two objects are equal only if they are the same object.**\n\nHere two variables reference the same object, thus they are equal:\n\n```js run\nlet a = {};\nlet b = a; // copy the reference\n\nalert( a == b ); // true, both variables reference the same object\nalert( a === b ); // true\n```\n\nAnd here two independent objects are not equal, even though both are empty:\n\n```js run\nlet a = {};\nlet b = {}; // two independent objects\n\nalert( a == b ); // false\n```\n\nFor comparisons like `obj1 > obj2` or for a comparison against a primitive `obj == 5`, objects are converted to primitives. We'll study how object conversions work very soon, but to tell the truth, such comparisons occur very rarely, usually as a result of a coding mistake.\n\n## Cloning and merging, Object.assign\n\nSo, copying an object variable creates one more reference to the same object.\n\nBut what if we need to duplicate an object? Create an independent copy, a clone?\n\nThat's also doable, but a little bit more difficult, because there's no built-in method for that in JavaScript. Actually, that's rarely needed. Copying by reference is good most of the time.\n\nBut if we really want that, then we need to create a new object and replicate the structure of the existing one by iterating over its properties and copying them on the primitive level.\n\nLike this:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30\n};\n\n*!*\nlet clone = {}; // the new empty object\n\n// let's copy all user properties into it\nfor (let key in user) {\n  clone[key] = user[key];\n}\n*/!*\n\n// now clone is a fully independent object with the same content\nclone.name = \"Pete\"; // changed the data in it\n\nalert( user.name ); // still John in the original object\n```\n\nAlso we can use the method [Object.assign](mdn:js/Object/assign) for that.\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\nObject.assign(dest, [src1, src2, src3...])\n```\n\n- The first argument `dest` is a target object.\n- Further arguments `src1, ..., srcN` (can be as many as needed) are source objects.\n- It copies the properties of all source objects `src1, ..., srcN` into the target `dest`. In other words, properties of all arguments starting from the second are copied into the first object.\n- The call returns `dest`.\n\nFor instance, we can use it to merge several objects into one:\n```js\nlet user = { name: \"John\" };\n\nlet permissions1 = { canView: true };\nlet permissions2 = { canEdit: true };\n\n*!*\n// copies all properties from permissions1 and permissions2 into user\nObject.assign(user, permissions1, permissions2);\n*/!*\n\n// now user = { name: \"John\", canView: true, canEdit: true }\n```\n\nIf the copied property name already exists, it gets overwritten:\n\n```js run\nlet user = { name: \"John\" };\n\nObject.assign(user, { name: \"Pete\" });\n\nalert(user.name); // now user = { name: \"Pete\" }\n```\n\nWe also can use `Object.assign` to replace `for..in` loop for simple cloning:\n\n```js\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30\n};\n\n*!*\nlet clone = Object.assign({}, user);\n*/!*\n```\n\nIt copies all properties of `user` into the empty object and returns it.\n\n## Nested cloning\n\nUntil now we assumed that all properties of `user` are primitive. But properties can be references to other objects. What to do with them?\n\nLike this:\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  sizes: {\n    height: 182,\n    width: 50\n  }\n};\n\nalert( user.sizes.height ); // 182\n```\n\nNow it's not enough to copy `clone.sizes = user.sizes`, because the `user.sizes` is an object, it will be copied by reference. So `clone` and `user` will share the same sizes:\n\nLike this:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  sizes: {\n    height: 182,\n    width: 50\n  }\n};\n\nlet clone = Object.assign({}, user);\n\nalert( user.sizes === clone.sizes ); // true, same object\n\n// user and clone share sizes\nuser.sizes.width++;       // change a property from one place\nalert(clone.sizes.width); // 51, see the result from the other one\n```\n\nTo fix that, we should use the cloning loop that examines each value of `user[key]` and, if it's an object, then replicate its structure as well. That is called a \"deep cloning\".\n\nThere's a standard algorithm for deep cloning that handles the case above and more complex cases, called the [Structured cloning algorithm](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/structured-data.html#safe-passing-of-structured-data).\n\nWe can use recursion to implement it. Or, not to reinvent the wheel, take an existing implementation, for instance [_.cloneDeep(obj)](https://lodash.com/docs#cloneDeep) from the JavaScript library [lodash](https://lodash.com).\n\n## Summary\n\nObjects are assigned and copied by reference. In other words, a variable stores not the \"object value\", but a \"reference\" (address in memory) for the value. So copying such a variable or passing it as a function argument copies that reference, not the object.\n\nAll operations via copied references (like adding/removing properties) are performed on the same single object.\n\nTo make a \"real copy\" (a clone) we can use `Object.assign` for the so-called \"shallow copy\" (nested objects are copied by reference) or a \"deep cloning\" function, such as [_.cloneDeep(obj)](https://lodash.com/docs#cloneDeep).",

All that takes memory.\n\nWhat happens when something is not needed any more? How does the JavaScript engine discover it and clean it up?\n\n## Reachability\n\nThe main concept of memory management in JavaScript is *reachability*.\n\nSimply put, \"reachable\" values are those that are accessible or usable somehow. They are guaranteed to be stored in memory.\n\n1. There's a base set of inherently reachable values, that cannot be deleted for obvious reasons.\n\n    For instance:\n\n    - Local variables and parameters of the current function.\n    - Variables and parameters for other functions on the current chain of nested calls.\n    - Global variables.\n    - (there are some other, internal ones as well)\n\n    These values are called *roots*.\n\n2. Any other value is considered reachable if it's reachable from a root by a reference or by a chain of references.\n\n    For instance, if there's an object in a local variable, and that object has a property referencing another object, that object is considered reachable. And those that it references are also reachable. Detailed examples to follow.\n\nThere's a background process in the JavaScript engine that is called [garbage collector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)). It monitors all objects and removes those that have become unreachable.\n\n## A simple example\n\nHere's the simplest example:\n\n```js\n// user has a reference to the object\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\"\n};\n```\n\n![](memory-user-john.svg)\n\nHere the arrow depicts an object reference. The global variable `\"user\"` references the object `{name: \"John\"}` (we'll call it John for brevity). The `\"name\"` property of John stores a primitive, so it's painted inside the object.\n\nIf the value of `user` is overwritten, the reference is lost:\n\n```js\nuser = null;\n```\n\n![](memory-user-john-lost.svg)\n\nNow John becomes unreachable. There's no way to access it, no references to it. Garbage collector will junk the data and free the memory.\n\n## Two references\n\nNow let's imagine we copied the reference from `user` to `admin`:\n\n```js\n// user has a reference to the object\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\"\n};\n\n*!*\nlet admin = user;\n*/!*\n```\n\n![](memory-user-john-admin.svg)\n\nNow if we do the same:\n```js\nuser = null;\n```\n\n...Then the object is still reachable via `admin` global variable, so it's in memory. If we overwrite `admin` too, then it can be removed.\n\n## Interlinked objects\n\nNow a more complex example. The family:\n\n```js\nfunction marry(man, woman) {\n  woman.husband = man;\n  man.wife = woman;\n\n  return {\n    father: man,\n    mother: woman\n  }\n}\n\nlet family = marry({\n  name: \"John\"\n}, {\n  name: \"Ann\"\n});\n```\n\nFunction `marry` \"marries\" two objects by giving them references to each other and returns a new object that contains them both.\n\nThe resulting memory structure:\n\n![](family.svg)\n\nAs of now, all objects are reachable.\n\nNow let's remove two references:\n\n```js\ndelete family.father;\ndelete family.mother.husband;\n```\n\n![](family-delete-refs.svg)\n\nIt's not enough to delete only one of these two references, because all objects would still be reachable.\n\nBut if we delete both, then we can see that John has no incoming reference any more:\n\n![](family-no-father.svg)\n\nOutgoing references do not matter. Only incoming ones can make an object reachable. So, John is now unreachable and will be removed from the memory with all its data that also became unaccessible.\n\nAfter garbage collection:\n\n![](family-no-father-2.svg)\n\n## Unreachable island\n\nIt is possible that the whole island of interlinked objects becomes unreachable and is removed from the memory.\n\nThe source object is the same as above. Then:\n\n```js\nfamily = null;\n```\n\nThe in-memory picture becomes:\n\n![](family-no-family.svg)\n\nThis example demonstrates how important the concept of reachability is.\n\nIt's obvious that John and Ann are still linked, both have incoming references. But that's not enough.\n\nThe former `\"family\"` object has been unlinked from the root, there's no reference to it any more, so the whole island becomes unreachable and will be removed.\n\n## Internal algorithms\n\nThe basic garbage collection algorithm is called \"mark-and-sweep\".\n\nThe following \"garbage collection\" steps are regularly performed:\n\n- The garbage collector takes roots and \"marks\" (remembers) them.\n- Then it visits and \"marks\" all references from them.\n- Then it visits marked objects and marks *their* references. All visited objects are remembered, so as not to visit the same object twice in the future.\n- ...And so on until every reachable (from the roots) references are visited.\n- All objects except marked ones are removed.\n\nFor instance, let our object structure look like this:\n\n![](garbage-collection-1.svg)\n\nWe can clearly see an \"unreachable island\" to the right side. Now let's see how \"mark-and-sweep\" garbage collector deals with it.\n\nThe first step marks the roots:\n\n![](garbage-collection-2.svg)\n\nThen their references are marked:\n\n![](garbage-collection-3.svg)\n\n...And their references, while possible:\n\n![](garbage-collection-4.svg)\n\nNow the objects that could not be visited in the process are considered unreachable and will be removed:\n\n![](garbage-collection-5.svg)\n\nWe can also imagine the process as spilling a huge bucket of paint from the roots, that flows through all references and marks all reachable objects. The unmarked ones are then removed.\n\nThat's the concept of how garbage collection works. JavaScript engines apply many optimizations to make it run faster and not affect the execution.\n\nSome of the optimizations:\n\n- **Generational collection** -- objects are split into two sets: \"new ones\" and \"old ones\". Many  objects appear, do their job and die fast, they can be cleaned up aggressively. Those that survive for long enough, become \"old\" and are examined less often.\n- **Incremental collection** -- if there are many objects, and we try to walk and mark the whole object set at once, it may take some time and introduce visible delays in the execution. So the engine tries to split the garbage collection into pieces. Then the pieces are executed one by one, separately. That requires some extra bookkeeping between them to track changes, but we have many tiny delays instead of a big one.\n- **Idle-time collection** -- the garbage collector tries to run only while the CPU is idle, to reduce the possible effect on the execution.\n\nThere exist other optimizations and flavours of garbage collection algorithms. As much as I'd like to describe them here, I have to hold off, because different engines implement different tweaks and techniques. And, what's even more important, things change as engines develop, so studying deeper \"in advance\", without a real need is probably not worth that. Unless, of course, it is a matter of pure interest, then there will be some links for you below.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe main things to know:\n\n- Garbage collection is performed automatically. We cannot force or prevent it.\n- Objects are retained in memory while they are reachable.\n- Being referenced is not the same as being reachable (from a root): a pack of interlinked objects can become unreachable as a whole.\n\nModern engines implement advanced algorithms of garbage collection.\n\nA general book \"The Garbage Collection Handbook: The Art of Automatic Memory Management\" (R. Jones et al) covers some of them.\n\nIf you are familiar with low-level programming, the more detailed information about V8 garbage collector is in the article [A tour of V8: Garbage Collection](http://jayconrod.com/posts/55/a-tour-of-v8-garbage-collection).\n\n[V8 blog](https://v8.dev/) also publishes articles about changes in memory management from time to time. Naturally, to learn the garbage collection, you'd better prepare by learning about V8 internals in general and read the blog of [Vyacheslav Egorov](http://mrale.ph) who worked as one of V8 engineers. I'm saying: \"V8\", because it is best covered with articles in the internet. For other engines, many approaches are similar, but garbage collection differs in many aspects.\n\nIn-depth knowledge of engines is good when you need low-level optimizations. It would be wise to plan that as the next step after you're familiar with the language.",

        "content": "\n\nObjects are usually created to represent entities of the real world, like users, orders and so on:\n\n```js\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30\n};\n```\n\nAnd, in the real world, a user can *act*: select something from the shopping cart, login, logout etc.\n\nActions are represented in JavaScript by functions in properties.\n\n## Method examples\n\nFor a start, let's teach the `user` to say hello:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30\n};\n\n*!*\nuser.sayHi = function() {\n  alert(\"Hello!\");\n};\n*/!*\n\nuser.sayHi(); // Hello!\n```\n\nHere we've just used a Function Expression to create the function and assign it to the property `user.sayHi` of the object.\n\nThen we can call it. The user can now speak!\n\nA function that is the property of an object is called its *method*.\n\nSo, here we've got a method `sayHi` of the object `user`.\n\nOf course, we could use a pre-declared function as a method, like this:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  // ...\n};\n\n*!*\n// first, declare\nfunction sayHi() {\n  alert(\"Hello!\");\n};\n\n// then add as a method\nuser.sayHi = sayHi;\n*/!*\n\nuser.sayHi(); // Hello!\n```\n\n```smart header=\"Object-oriented programming\"\nWhen we write our code using objects to represent entities, that's called [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), in short: \"OOP\".\n\nOOP is a big thing, an interesting science of its own. How to choose the right entities? How to organize the interaction between them? That's architecture, and there are great books on that topic, like \"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software\" by E. Gamma, R. Helm, R. Johnson, J. Vissides or \"Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications\" by G. Booch, and more.\n```\n### Method shorthand\n\nThere exists a shorter syntax for methods in an object literal:\n\n```js\n// these objects do the same\n\nuser = {\n  sayHi: function() {\n    alert(\"Hello\");\n  }\n};\n\n// method shorthand looks better, right?\nuser = {\n*!*\n  sayHi() { // same as \"sayHi: function()\"\n*/!*\n    alert(\"Hello\");\n  }\n};\n```\n\nAs demonstrated, we can omit `\"function\"` and just write `sayHi()`.\n\nTo tell the truth, the notations are not fully identical. There are subtle differences related to object inheritance (to be covered later), but for now they do not matter. In almost all cases the shorter syntax is preferred.\n\n## \"this\" in methods\n\nIt's common that an object method needs to access the information stored in the object to do its job.\n\nFor instance, the code inside `user.sayHi()` may need the name of the `user`.\n\n**To access the object, a method can use the `this` keyword.**\n\nThe value of `this` is the object \"before dot\", the one used to call the method.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30,\n\n  sayHi() {\n*!*\n    // \"this\" is the \"current object\"\n    alert(this.name);\n*/!*\n  }\n\n};\n\nuser.sayHi(); // John\n```\n\nHere during the execution of `user.sayHi()`, the value of `this` will be `user`.\n\nTechnically, it's also possible to access the object without `this`, by referencing it via the outer variable:\n\n```js\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30,\n\n  sayHi() {\n*!*\n    alert(user.name); // \"user\" instead of \"this\"\n*/!*\n  }\n\n};\n```\n\n...But such code is unreliable. If we decide to copy `user` to another variable, e.g. `admin = user` and overwrite `user` with something else, then it will access the wrong object.\n\nThat's demonstrated below:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30,\n\n  sayHi() {\n*!*\n    alert( user.name ); // leads to an error\n*/!*\n  }\n\n};\n\n\nlet admin = user;\nuser = null; // overwrite to make things obvious\n\nadmin.sayHi(); // Whoops! inside sayHi(), the old name is used! error!\n```\n\nIf we used `this.name` instead of `user.name` inside the `alert`, then the code would work.\n\n## \"this\" is not bound\n\nIn JavaScript, keyword `this` behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function.\n\nThere's no syntax error in the following example:\n\n```js\nfunction sayHi() {\n  alert( *!*this*/!*.name );\n}\n```\n\nThe value of `this` is evaluated during the run-time, depending on the context.\n\nFor instance, here the same function is assigned to two different objects and has different \"this\" in the calls:\n\n```js run\nlet user = { name: \"John\" };\nlet admin = { name: \"Admin\" };\n\nfunction sayHi() {\n  alert( this.name );\n}\n\n*!*\n// use the same function in two objects\nuser.f = sayHi;\nadmin.f = sayHi;\n*/!*\n\n// these calls have different this\n// \"this\" inside the function is the object \"before the dot\"\nuser.f(); // John  (this == user)\nadmin.f(); // Admin  (this == admin)\n\nadmin['f'](); // Admin (dot or square brackets access the method – doesn't matter)\n```\n\nThe rule is simple: if `obj.f()` is called, then `this` is `obj` during the call of `f`. So it's either `user` or `admin` in the example above.\n\n````smart header=\"Calling without an object: `this == undefined`\"\nWe can even call the function without an object at all:\n\n```js run\nfunction sayHi() {\n  alert(this);\n}\n\nsayHi(); // undefined\n```\n\nIn this case `this` is `undefined` in strict mode. If we try to access `this.name`, there will be an error.\n\nIn non-strict mode the value of `this` in such case will be the *global object* (`window` in a browser, we'll get to it later in the chapter [](info:global-object)). This is a historical behavior that `\"use strict\"` fixes.\n\nUsually such call is a programming error. If there's `this` inside a function, it expects to be called in an object context.\n````\n\n```smart header=\"The consequences of unbound `this`\"\nIf you come from another programming language, then you are probably used to the idea of a \"bound `this`\", where methods defined in an object always have `this` referencing that object.\n\nIn JavaScript `this` is \"free\", its value is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the method was declared, but rather on what object is \"before the dot\".\n\nThe concept of run-time evaluated `this` has both pluses and minuses. On the one hand, a function can be reused for different objects. On the other hand, the greater flexibility creates more possibilities for mistakes.\n\nHere our position is not to judge whether this language design decision is good or bad. We'll understand how to work with it, how to get benefits and avoid problems.\n```\n\n## Arrow functions have no \"this\"\n\nArrow functions are special: they don't have their \"own\" `this`. If we reference `this` from such a function, it's taken from the outer \"normal\" function.\n\nFor instance, here `arrow()` uses `this` from the outer `user.sayHi()` method:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  firstName: \"Ilya\",\n  sayHi() {\n    let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);\n    arrow();\n  }\n};\n\nuser.sayHi(); // Ilya\n```\n\nThat's a special feature of arrow functions, it's useful when we actually do not want to have a separate `this`, but rather to take it from the outer context. Later in the chapter <info:arrow-functions> we'll go more deeply into arrow functions.\n\n\n## Summary\n\n- Functions that are stored in object properties are called \"methods\".\n- Methods allow objects to \"act\" like `object.doSomething()`.\n- Methods can reference the object as `this`.\n\nThe value of `this` is defined at run-time.\n- When a function is declared, it may use `this`, but that `this` has no value until the function is called.\n- A function can be copied between objects.\n- When a function is called in the \"method\" syntax: `object.method()`, the value of `this` during the call is `object`.\n\nPlease note that arrow functions are special: they have no `this`. When `this` is accessed inside an arrow function, it is taken from outside.",

        "content": "\n\nThe regular `{...}` syntax allows to create one object. But often we need to create many similar objects, like multiple users or menu items and so on.\n\nThat can be done using constructor functions and the `\"new\"` operator.\n\n## Constructor function\n\nConstructor functions technically are regular functions. There are two conventions though:\n\n1. They are named with capital letter first.\n2. They should be executed only with `\"new\"` operator.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nfunction User(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.isAdmin = false;\n}\n\n*!*\nlet user = new User(\"Jack\");\n*/!*\n\nalert(user.name); // Jack\nalert(user.isAdmin); // false\n```\n\nWhen a function is executed with `new`, it does the following steps:\n\n1. A new empty object is created and assigned to `this`.\n2. The function body executes. Usually it modifies `this`, adds new properties to it.\n3. The value of `this` is returned.\n\nIn other words, `new User(...)` does something like:\n\n```js\nfunction User(name) {\n*!*\n  // this = {};  (implicitly)\n*/!*\n\n  // add properties to this\n  this.name = name;\n  this.isAdmin = false;\n\n*!*\n  // return this;  (implicitly)\n*/!*\n}\n```\n\nSo `let user = new User(\"Jack\")` gives the same result as:\n\n```js\nlet user = {\n  name: \"Jack\",\n  isAdmin: false\n};\n```\n\nNow if we want to create other users, we can call `new User(\"Ann\")`, `new User(\"Alice\")` and so on. Much shorter than using literals every time, and also easy to read.\n\nThat's the main purpose of constructors -- to implement reusable object creation code.\n\nLet's note once again -- technically, any function can be used as a constructor. That is: any function can be run with `new`, and it will execute the algorithm above. The \"capital letter first\" is a common agreement, to make it clear that a function is to be run with `new`.\n\n````smart header=\"new function() { ... }\"\nIf we have many lines of code all about creation of a single complex object, we can wrap them in constructor function, like this:\n\n```js\nlet user = new function() {\n  this.name = \"John\";\n  this.isAdmin = false;\n\n  // ...other code for user creation\n  // maybe complex logic and statements\n  // local variables etc\n};\n```\n\nThe constructor can't be called again, because it is not saved anywhere, just created and called. So this trick aims to encapsulate the code that constructs the single object, without future reuse.\n````\n\n## Constructor mode test: new.target\n\n```smart header=\"Advanced stuff\"\nThe syntax from this section is rarely used, skip it unless you want to know everything.\n```\n\nInside a function, we can check whether it was called with `new` or without it, using a special `new.target` property.\n\nIt is empty for regular calls and equals the function if called with `new`:\n\n```js run\nfunction User() {\n  alert(new.target);\n}\n\n// without \"new\":\n*!*\nUser(); // undefined\n*/!*\n\n// with \"new\":\n*!*\nnew User(); // function User { ... }\n*/!*\n```\n\nThat can be used inside the function to know whether it was called with `new`, \"in constructor mode\", or without it, \"in regular mode\".\n\nWe can also make both `new` and regular calls to do the same, like this:\n\n```js run\nfunction User(name) {\n  if (!new.target) { // if you run me without new\n    return new User(name); // ...I will add new for you\n  }\n\n  this.name = name;\n}\n\nlet john = User(\"John\"); // redirects call to new User\nalert(john.name); // John\n```\n\nThis approach is sometimes used in libraries to make the syntax more flexible. So that people may call the function with or without `new`, and it still works.\n\nProbably not a good thing to use everywhere though, because omitting `new` makes it a bit less obvious what's going on. With `new` we all know that the new object is being created.\n\n## Return from constructors\n\nUsually, constructors do not have a `return` statement. Their task is to write all necessary stuff into `this`, and it automatically becomes the result.\n\nBut if there is a `return` statement, then the rule is simple:\n\n- If `return` is called with an object, then the object is returned instead of `this`.\n- If `return` is called with a primitive, it's ignored.\n\nIn other words, `return` with an object returns that object, in all other cases `this` is returned.\n\nFor instance, here `return` overrides `this` by returning an object:\n\n```js run\nfunction BigUser() {\n\n  this.name = \"John\";\n\n  return { name: \"Godzilla\" };  // <-- returns this object\n}\n\nalert( new BigUser().name );  // Godzilla, got that object\n```\n\nAnd here's an example with an empty `return` (or we could place a primitive after it, doesn't matter):\n\n```js run\nfunction SmallUser() {\n\n  this.name = \"John\";\n\n  return; // <-- returns this\n}\n\nalert( new SmallUser().name );  // John\n```\n\nUsually constructors don't have a `return` statement. Here we mention the special behavior with returning objects mainly for the sake of completeness.\n\n````smart header=\"Omitting parentheses\"\nBy the way, we can omit parentheses after `new`, if it has no arguments:\n\n```js\nlet user = new User; // <-- no parentheses\n// same as\nlet user = new User();\n```\n\nOmitting parentheses here is not considered a \"good style\", but the syntax is permitted by specification.\n````\n\n## Methods in constructor\n\nUsing constructor functions to create objects gives a great deal of flexibility. The constructor function may have parameters that define how to construct the object, and what to put in it.\n\nOf course, we can add to `this` not only properties, but methods as well.\n\nFor instance, `new User(name)` below creates an object with the given `name` and the method `sayHi`:\n\n```js run\nfunction User(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n\n  this.sayHi = function() {\n    alert( \"My name is: \" + this.name );\n  };\n}\n\n*!*\nlet john = new User(\"John\");\n\njohn.sayHi(); // My name is: John\n*/!*\n\n/*\njohn = {\n   name: \"John\",\n   sayHi: function() { ... }\n}\n*/\n```\n\nTo create complex objects, there's a more advanced syntax, [classes](info:classes), that we'll cover later.\n\n## Summary\n\n- Constructor functions or, briefly, constructors, are regular functions, but there's a common agreement to name them with capital letter first.\n- Constructor functions should only be called using `new`. Such a call implies a creation of empty `this` at the start and returning the populated one at the end.\n\nWe can use constructor functions to make multiple similar objects.\n\nJavaScript provides constructor functions for many built-in language objects: like `Date` for dates, `Set` for sets and others that we plan to study.\n\n```smart header=\"Objects, we'll be back!\"\nIn this chapter we only cover the basics about objects and constructors. They are essential for learning more about data types and functions in the next chapters.\n\nAfter we learn that, we return to objects and cover them in-depth in the chapters <info:prototypes> and <info:classes>.\n```",

Then we can't safely read `user.address.street`:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {}; // the user happens to be without address\n\nalert(user.address.street); // Error!\n```\n\nOr, in the web development, we'd like to get an information about an element on the page, but it may not exist:\n\n```js run\n// Error if the result of querySelector(...) is null\nlet html = document.querySelector('.my-element').innerHTML;\n```\n\nBefore `?.` appeared in the language, the `&&` operator was used to work around that.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {}; // user has no address\n\nalert( user && user.address && user.address.street ); // undefined (no error)\n```\n\nAND'ing the whole path to the property ensures that all components exist, but is cumbersome to write.\n\n## Optional chaining\n\nThe optional chaining `?.` stops the evaluation and returns `undefined` if the part before `?.` is `undefined` or `null`.\n\nFurther in this article, for brevity, we'll be saying that something \"exists\" if it's not `null` and not `undefined`.\n\n\nHere's the safe way to access `user.address.street`:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {}; // user has no address\n\nalert( user?.address?.street ); // undefined (no error)\n```\n\nReading the address with `user?.address` works even if `user` object doesn't exist:\n\n```js run\nlet user = null;\n\nalert( user?.address ); // undefined\n\nalert( user?.address.street ); // undefined\nalert( user?.address.street.anything ); // undefined\n```\n\nPlease note: the `?.` syntax works exactly where it's placed, not any further.\n\nIn the last two lines the evaluation stops immediately after `user?.`, never accessing further properties. But if the `user` actually exists, then the further intermediate properties, such as `user.address` must exist.\n\n```warn header=\"Don't overuse the optional chaining\"\nWe should use `?.` only where it's ok that something doesn't exist.\n\nFor example, if according to our coding logic `user` object must be there, but `address` is optional, then `user.address?.street` would be better.\n\nSo, if `user` happens to be undefined due to a mistake, we'll know about it and fix it. Otherwise, coding errors can be silenced where not appropriate, and become more difficult to debug.\n```\n\n````warn header=\"The variable before `?.` must exist\"\nIf there's no variable `user`, then `user?.anything` triggers an error:\n\n```js run\n// ReferenceError: user is not defined\nuser?.address;\n```\nThe optional chaining only tests for `null/undefined`, doesn't interfere with any other language mechanics.\n````\n\n## Short-circuiting\n\nAs it was said before, the `?.` immediately stops (\"short-circuits\") the evaluation if the left part doesn't exist.\n\nSo, if there are any further function calls or side effects, they don't occur:\n\n```js run\nlet user = null;\nlet x = 0;\n\nuser?.sayHi(x++); // nothing happens\n\nalert(x); // 0, value not incremented\n```\n\n## Other cases: ?.(), ?.[]\n\nThe optional chaining `?.` is not an operator, but a special syntax construct, that also works with functions and square brackets.\n\nFor example, `?.()` is used to call a function that may not exist.\n\nIn the code below, some of our users have `admin` method, and some don't:\n\n```js run\nlet user1 = {\n  admin() {\n    alert(\"I am admin\");\n  }\n}\n\nlet user2 = {};\n\n*!*\nuser1.admin?.(); // I am admin\nuser2.admin?.();\n*/!*\n```\n\nHere, in both lines we first use the dot `.` to get `admin` property, because the user object must exist, so it's safe read from it.\n\nThen `?.()` checks the left part: if the admin function exists, then it runs (for `user1`). Otherwise (for `user2`) the evaluation stops without errors.\n\nThe `?.[]` syntax also works, if we'd like to use brackets `[]` to access properties instead of dot `.`. Similar to previous cases, it allows to safely read a property from an object that may not exist.\n\n```js run\nlet user1 = {\n  firstName: \"John\"\n};\n\nlet user2 = null; // Imagine, we couldn't authorize the user\n\nlet key = \"firstName\";\n\nalert( user1?.[key] ); // John\nalert( user2?.[key] ); // undefined\n\nalert( user1?.[key]?.something?.not?.existing); // undefined\n```\n\nAlso we can use `?.` with `delete`:\n\n```js run\ndelete user?.name; // delete user.name if user exists\n```\n\n```warn header=\"We can use `?.` for safe reading and deleting, but not writing\"\nThe optional chaining `?.` has no use at the left side of an assignment:\n\n```js run\n// the idea of the code below is to write user.name, if user exists\n\nuser?.name = \"John\"; // Error, doesn't work\n// because it evaluates to undefined = \"John\"\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nThe `?.` syntax has three forms:\n\n1. `obj?.prop` -- returns `obj.prop` if `obj` exists, otherwise `undefined`.\n2. `obj?.[prop]` -- returns `obj[prop]` if `obj` exists, otherwise `undefined`.\n3. `obj?.method()` -- calls `obj.method()` if `obj` exists, otherwise returns `undefined`.\n\nAs we can see, all of them are straightforward and simple to use. The `?.` checks the left part for `null/undefined` and allows the evaluation to proceed if it's not so.\n\nA chain of `?.` allows to safely access nested properties.\n\nStill, we should apply `?.` carefully, only where it's ok that the left part doesn't to exist.\n\nSo that it won't hide programming errors from us, if they occur.",

        "content": "\n\nBy specification, object property keys may be either of string type, or of symbol type. Not numbers, not booleans, only strings or symbols, these two types.\n\nTill now we've been using only strings. Now let's see the benefits that symbols can give us.\n\n## Symbols\n\nA \"symbol\" represents a unique identifier.\n\nA value of this type can be created using `Symbol()`:\n\n```js\n// id is a new symbol\nlet id = Symbol();\n```\n\nUpon creation, we can give symbol a description (also called a symbol name), mostly useful for debugging purposes:\n\n```js\n// id is a symbol with the description \"id\"\nlet id = Symbol(\"id\");\n```\n\nSymbols are guaranteed to be unique. Even if we create many symbols with the same description, they are different values. The description is just a label that doesn't affect anything.\n\nFor instance, here are two symbols with the same description -- they are not equal:\n\n```js run\nlet id1 = Symbol(\"id\");\nlet id2 = Symbol(\"id\");\n\n*!*\nalert(id1 == id2); // false\n*/!*\n```\n\nIf you are familiar with Ruby or another language that also has some sort of \"symbols\" -- please don't be misguided. JavaScript symbols are different.\n\n````warn header=\"Symbols don't auto-convert to a string\"\nMost values in JavaScript support implicit conversion to a string. For instance, we can `alert` almost any value, and it will work. Symbols are special. They don't auto-convert.\n\nFor instance, this `alert` will show an error:\n\n```js run\nlet id = Symbol(\"id\");\n*!*\nalert(id); // TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string\n*/!*\n```\n\nThat's a \"language guard\" against messing up, because strings and symbols are fundamentally different and should not accidentally convert one into another.\n\nIf we really want to show a symbol, we need to explicitly call `.toString()` on it, like here:\n```js run\nlet id = Symbol(\"id\");\n*!*\nalert(id.toString()); // Symbol(id), now it works\n*/!*\n```\n\nOr get `symbol.description` property to show the description only:\n```js run\nlet id = Symbol(\"id\");\n*!*\nalert(id.description); // id\n*/!*\n```\n\n````\n\n## \"Hidden\" properties\n\nSymbols allow us to create \"hidden\" properties of an object, that no other part of code can accidentally access or overwrite.\n\nFor instance, if we're working with `user` objects, that belong to a third-party code. We'd like to add identifiers to them.\n\nLet's use a symbol key for it:\n\n```js run\nlet user = { // belongs to another code\n  name: \"John\"\n};\n\nlet id = Symbol(\"id\");\n\nuser[id] = 1;\n\nalert( user[id] ); // we can access the data using the symbol as the key\n```\n\nWhat's the benefit of using `Symbol(\"id\")` over a string `\"id\"`?\n\nAs `user` objects belongs to another code, and that code also works with them, we shouldn't just add any fields to it. That's unsafe. But a symbol cannot be accessed accidentally, the third-party code probably won't even see it, so it's probably all right to do.\n\nAlso, imagine that another script wants to have its own identifier inside `user`, for its own purposes. That may be another JavaScript library, so that the scripts are completely unaware of each other.\n\nThen that script can create its own `Symbol(\"id\")`, like this:\n\n```js\n// ...\nlet id = Symbol(\"id\");\n\nuser[id] = \"Their id value\";\n```\n\nThere will be no conflict between our and their identifiers, because symbols are always different, even if they have the same name.\n\n...But if we used a string `\"id\"` instead of a symbol for the same purpose, then there *would* be a conflict:\n\n```js run\nlet user = { name: \"John\" };\n\n// Our script uses \"id\" property\nuser.id = \"Our id value\";\n\n// ...Another script also wants \"id\" for its purposes...\n\nuser.id = \"Their id value\"\n// Boom! overwritten by another script!\n```\n\n### Symbols in a literal\n\nIf we want to use a symbol in an object literal `{...}`, we need square brackets around it.\n\nLike this:\n\n```js\nlet id = Symbol(\"id\");\n\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n*!*\n  [id]: 123 // not \"id: 123\"\n*/!*\n};\n```\nThat's because we need the value from the variable `id` as the key, not the string \"id\".\n\n### Symbols are skipped by for..in\n\nSymbolic properties do not participate in `for..in` loop.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet id = Symbol(\"id\");\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30,\n  [id]: 123\n};\n\n*!*\nfor (let key in user) alert(key); // name, age (no symbols)\n*/!*\n\n// the direct access by the symbol works\nalert( \"Direct: \" + user[id] );\n```\n\n`Object.keys(user)` also ignores them. That's a part of the general \"hiding symbolic properties\" principle. If another script or a library loops over our object, it won't unexpectedly access a symbolic property.\n\nIn contrast, [Object.assign](mdn:js/Object/assign) copies both string and symbol properties:\n\n```js run\nlet id = Symbol(\"id\");\nlet user = {\n  [id]: 123\n};\n\nlet clone = Object.assign({}, user);\n\nalert( clone[id] ); // 123\n```\n\nThere's no paradox here. That's by design. The idea is that when we clone an object or merge objects, we usually want *all* properties to be copied (including symbols like `id`).\n\n## Global symbols\n\nAs we've seen, usually all symbols are different, even if they have the same name. But sometimes we want same-named symbols to be same entities. For instance, different parts of our application want to access symbol `\"id\"` meaning exactly the same property.\n\nTo achieve that, there exists a *global symbol registry*. We can create symbols in it and access them later, and it guarantees that repeated accesses by the same name return exactly the same symbol.\n\nIn order to read (create if absent) a symbol from the registry, use `Symbol.for(key)`.\n\nThat call checks the global registry, and if there's a symbol described as `key`, then returns it, otherwise creates a new symbol `Symbol(key)` and stores it in the registry by the given `key`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\n// read from the global registry\nlet id = Symbol.for(\"id\"); // if the symbol did not exist, it is created\n\n// read it again (maybe from another part of the code)\nlet idAgain = Symbol.for(\"id\");\n\n// the same symbol\nalert( id === idAgain ); // true\n```\n\nSymbols inside the registry are called *global symbols*. If we want an application-wide symbol, accessible everywhere in the code -- that's what they are for.\n\n```smart header=\"That sounds like Ruby\"\nIn some programming languages, like Ruby, there's a single symbol per name.\n\nIn JavaScript, as we can see, that's right for global symbols.\n```\n\n### Symbol.keyFor\n\nFor global symbols, not only `Symbol.for(key)` returns a symbol by name, but there's a reverse call: `Symbol.keyFor(sym)`, that does the reverse: returns a name by a global symbol.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\n// get symbol by name\nlet sym = Symbol.for(\"name\");\nlet sym2 = Symbol.for(\"id\");\n\n// get name by symbol\nalert( Symbol.keyFor(sym) ); // name\nalert( Symbol.keyFor(sym2) ); // id\n```\n\nThe `Symbol.keyFor` internally uses the global symbol registry to look up the key for the symbol. So it doesn't work for non-global symbols. If the symbol is not global, it won't be able to find it and returns `undefined`.\n\nThat said, any symbols have `description` property.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet globalSymbol = Symbol.for(\"name\");\nlet localSymbol = Symbol(\"name\");\n\nalert( Symbol.keyFor(globalSymbol) ); // name, global symbol\nalert( Symbol.keyFor(localSymbol) ); // undefined, not global\n\nalert( localSymbol.description ); // name\n```\n\n## System symbols\n\nThere exist many \"system\" symbols that JavaScript uses internally, and we can use them to fine-tune various aspects of our objects.\n\nThey are listed in the specification in the [Well-known symbols](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-well-known-symbols) table:\n\n- `Symbol.hasInstance`\n- `Symbol.isConcatSpreadable`\n- `Symbol.iterator`\n- `Symbol.toPrimitive`\n- ...and so on.\n\nFor instance, `Symbol.toPrimitive` allows us to describe object to primitive conversion. We'll see its use very soon.\n\nOther symbols will also become familiar when we study the corresponding language features.\n\n## Summary\n\n`Symbol` is a primitive type for unique identifiers.\n\nSymbols are created with `Symbol()` call with an optional description (name).\n\nSymbols are always different values, even if they have the same name. If we want same-named symbols to be equal, then we should use the global registry: `Symbol.for(key)` returns (creates if needed) a global symbol with `key` as the name. Multiple calls of `Symbol.for` with the same `key` return exactly the same symbol.\n\nSymbols have two main use cases:\n\n1. \"Hidden\" object properties.\n    If we want to add a property into an object that \"belongs\" to another script or a library, we can create a symbol and use it as a property key. A symbolic property does not appear in `for..in`, so it won't be accidentally processed together with other properties. Also it won't be accessed directly, because another script does not have our symbol. So the property will be protected from accidental use or overwrite.\n\n    So we can \"covertly\" hide something into objects that we need, but others should not see, using symbolic properties.\n\n2. There are many system symbols used by JavaScript which are accessible as `Symbol.*`. We can use them to alter some built-in behaviors. For instance, later in the tutorial we'll use `Symbol.iterator` for [iterables](info:iterable), `Symbol.toPrimitive` to setup [object-to-primitive conversion](info:object-toprimitive) and so on.\n\nTechnically, symbols are not 100% hidden. There is a built-in method [Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(obj)](mdn:js/Object/getOwnPropertySymbols) that allows us to get all symbols. Also there is a method named [Reflect.ownKeys(obj)](mdn:js/Reflect/ownKeys) that returns *all* keys of an object including symbolic ones. So they are not really hidden. But most libraries, built-in functions and syntax constructs don't use these methods.",

But we left a gap for objects. Now, as we know about methods and symbols it becomes possible to fill it.\n\n1. All objects are `true` in a boolean context. There are only numeric and string conversions.\n2. The numeric conversion happens when we subtract objects or apply mathematical functions. For instance, `Date` objects (to be covered in the chapter <info:date>) can be subtracted, and the result of `date1 - date2` is the time difference between two dates.\n3. As for the string conversion -- it usually happens when we output an object like `alert(obj)` and in similar contexts.\n\n## ToPrimitive\n\nWe can fine-tune string and numeric conversion, using special object methods.\n\nThere are three variants of type conversion, so-called \"hints\", described in the [specification](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-toprimitive):\n\n`\"string\"`\n: For an object-to-string conversion, when we're doing an operation on an object that expects a string, like `alert`:\n\n    ```js\n    // output\n    alert(obj);\n\n    // using object as a property key\n    anotherObj[obj] = 123;\n    ```\n\n`\"number\"`\n: For an object-to-number conversion, like when we're doing maths:\n\n    ```js\n    // explicit conversion\n    let num = Number(obj);\n\n    // maths (except binary plus)\n    let n = +obj; // unary plus\n    let delta = date1 - date2;\n\n    // less/greater comparison\n    let greater = user1 > user2;\n    ```\n\n`\"default\"`\n: Occurs in rare cases when the operator is \"not sure\" what type to expect.\n\n    For instance, binary plus `+` can work both with strings (concatenates them) and numbers (adds them), so both strings and numbers would do. So if the a binary plus gets an object as an argument, it uses the `\"default\"` hint to convert it.\n\n    Also, if an object is compared using `==` with a string, number or a symbol, it's also unclear which conversion should be done, so the `\"default\"` hint is used.\n\n    ```js\n    // binary plus uses the \"default\" hint\n    let total = obj1 + obj2;\n\n    // obj == number uses the \"default\" hint\n    if (user == 1) { ... };\n    ```\n\n    The greater and less comparison operators, such as `<` `>`, can work with both strings and numbers too. Still, they use the `\"number\"` hint, not `\"default\"`. That's for historical reasons.\n\n    In practice though, we don't need to remember these peculiar details, because all built-in objects except for one case (`Date` object, we'll learn it later) implement `\"default\"` conversion the same way as `\"number\"`. And we can do the same.\n\n```smart header=\"No `\\\"boolean\\\"` hint\"\nPlease note -- there are only three hints. It's that simple.\n\nThere is no \"boolean\" hint (all objects are `true` in boolean context) or anything else. And if we treat `\"default\"` and `\"number\"` the same, like most built-ins do, then there are only two conversions.\n```\n\n**To do the conversion, JavaScript tries to find and call three object methods:**\n\n1. Call `obj[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint)` - the method with the symbolic key `Symbol.toPrimitive` (system symbol), if such method exists,\n2. Otherwise if hint is `\"string\"`\n    - try `obj.toString()` and `obj.valueOf()`, whatever exists.\n3. Otherwise if hint is `\"number\"` or `\"default\"`\n    - try `obj.valueOf()` and `obj.toString()`, whatever exists.\n\n## Symbol.toPrimitive\n\nLet's start from the first method. There's a built-in symbol named `Symbol.toPrimitive` that should be used to name the conversion method, like this:\n\n```js\nobj[Symbol.toPrimitive] = function(hint) {\n  // must return a primitive value\n  // hint = one of \"string\", \"number\", \"default\"\n};\n```\n\nFor instance, here `user` object implements it:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  money: 1000,\n\n  [Symbol.toPrimitive](hint) {\n    alert(`hint: ${hint}`);\n    return hint == \"string\" ? `{name: \"${this.name}\"}` : this.money;\n  }\n};\n\n// conversions demo:\nalert(user); // hint: string -> {name: \"John\"}\nalert(+user); // hint: number -> 1000\nalert(user + 500); // hint: default -> 1500\n```\n\nAs we can see from the code, `user` becomes a self-descriptive string or a money amount depending on the conversion. The single method `user[Symbol.toPrimitive]` handles all conversion cases.\n\n\n## toString/valueOf\n\nMethods `toString` and `valueOf` come from ancient times. They are not symbols (symbols did not exist that long ago), but rather \"regular\" string-named methods. They provide an alternative \"old-style\" way to implement the conversion.\n\nIf there's no `Symbol.toPrimitive` then JavaScript tries to find them and try in the order:\n\n- `toString -> valueOf` for \"string\" hint.\n- `valueOf -> toString` otherwise.\n\nThese methods must return a primitive value. If `toString` or `valueOf` returns an object, then it's ignored (same as if there were no method).\n\nBy default, a plain object has following `toString` and `valueOf` methods:\n\n- The `toString` method returns a string `\"[object Object]\"`.\n- The `valueOf` method returns the object itself.\n\nHere's the demo:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {name: \"John\"};\n\nalert(user); // [object Object]\nalert(user.valueOf() === user); // true\n```\n\nSo if we try to use an object as a string, like in an `alert` or so, then by default we see `[object Object]`.\n\nAnd the default `valueOf` is mentioned here only for the sake of completeness, to avoid any confusion. As you can see, it returns the object itself, and so is ignored. Don't ask me why, that's for historical reasons. So we can assume it doesn't exist.\n\nLet's implement these methods.\n\nFor instance, here `user` does the same as above using a combination of `toString` and `valueOf` instead of `Symbol.toPrimitive`:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  money: 1000,\n\n  // for hint=\"string\"\n  toString() {\n    return `{name: \"${this.name}\"}`;\n  },\n\n  // for hint=\"number\" or \"default\"\n  valueOf() {\n    return this.money;\n  }\n\n};\n\nalert(user); // toString -> {name: \"John\"}\nalert(+user); // valueOf -> 1000\nalert(user + 500); // valueOf -> 1500\n```\n\nAs we can see, the behavior is the same as the previous example with `Symbol.toPrimitive`.\n\nOften we want a single \"catch-all\" place to handle all primitive conversions. In this case, we can implement `toString` only, like this:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n\n  toString() {\n    return this.name;\n  }\n};\n\nalert(user); // toString -> John\nalert(user + 500); // toString -> John500\n```\n\nIn the absence of `Symbol.toPrimitive` and `valueOf`, `toString` will handle all primitive conversions.\n\n## Return types\n\nThe important thing to know about all primitive-conversion methods is that they do not necessarily return the \"hinted\" primitive.\n\nThere is no control whether `toString` returns exactly a string, or whether `Symbol.toPrimitive` method returns a number for a hint `\"number\"`.\n\nThe only mandatory thing: these methods must return a primitive, not an object.\n\n```smart header=\"Historical notes\"\nFor historical reasons, if `toString` or `valueOf` returns an object, there's no error, but such value is ignored (like if the method didn't exist). That's because in ancient times there was no good \"error\" concept in JavaScript.\n\nIn contrast, `Symbol.toPrimitive` *must* return a primitive, otherwise there will be an error.\n```\n\n## Further conversions\n\nAs we know already, many operators and functions perform type conversions, e.g. multiplication `*` converts operands to numbers.\n\nIf we pass an object as an argument, then there are two stages:\n1. The object is converted to a primitive (using the rules described above).\n2. If the resulting primitive isn't of the right type, it's converted.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet obj = {\n  // toString handles all conversions in the absence of other methods\n  toString() {\n    return \"2\";\n  }\n};\n\nalert(obj * 2); // 4, object converted to primitive \"2\", then multiplication made it a number\n```\n\n1. The multiplication `obj * 2` first converts the object to primitive (that's a string `\"2\"`).\n2. Then `\"2\" * 2` becomes `2 * 2` (the string is converted to number).\n\nBinary plus will concatenate strings in the same situation, as it gladly accepts a string:\n\n```js run\nlet obj = {\n  toString() {\n    return \"2\";\n  }\n};\n\nalert(obj + 2); // 22 (\"2\" + 2), conversion to primitive returned a string => concatenation\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nThe object-to-primitive conversion is called automatically by many built-in functions and operators that expect a primitive as a value.\n\nThere are 3 types (hints) of it:\n- `\"string\"` (for `alert` and other operations that need a string)\n- `\"number\"` (for maths)\n- `\"default\"` (few operators)\n\nThe specification describes explicitly which operator uses which hint. There are very few operators that \"don't know what to expect\" and use the `\"default\"` hint. Usually for built-in objects `\"default\"` hint is handled the same way as `\"number\"`, so in practice the last two are often merged together.\n\nThe conversion algorithm is:\n\n1. Call `obj[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint)` if the method exists,\n2. Otherwise if hint is `\"string\"`\n    - try `obj.toString()` and `obj.valueOf()`, whatever exists.\n3. Otherwise if hint is `\"number\"` or `\"default\"`\n    - try `obj.valueOf()` and `obj.toString()`, whatever exists.\n\nIn practice, it's often enough to implement only `obj.toString()` as a \"catch-all\" method for all conversions that return a \"human-readable\" representation of an object, for logging or debugging purposes.",

        "content": "\n\nJavaScript allows us to work with primitives (strings, numbers, etc.) as if they were objects. They also provide methods to call as such. We will study those soon, but first we'll see how it works because, of course, primitives are not objects (and here we will make it even clearer).\n\nLet's look at the key distinctions between primitives and objects.\n\nA primitive\n\n- Is a value of a primitive type.\n- There are 7 primitive types: `string`, `number`, `bigint`, `boolean`, `symbol`, `null` and `undefined`.\n\nAn object\n\n- Is capable of storing multiple values as properties.\n- Can be created with `{}`, for instance: `{name: \"John\", age: 30}`. There are other kinds of objects in JavaScript: functions, for example, are objects.\n\nOne of the best things about objects is that we can store a function as one of its properties.\n\n```js run\nlet john = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  sayHi: function() {\n    alert(\"Hi buddy!\");\n  }\n};\n\njohn.sayHi(); // Hi buddy!\n```\n\nSo here we've made an object `john` with the method `sayHi`.\n\nMany built-in objects already exist, such as those that work with dates, errors, HTML elements, etc. They have different properties and methods.\n\nBut, these features come with a cost!\n\nObjects are \"heavier\" than primitives. They require additional resources to support the internal machinery.\n\n## A primitive as an object\n\nHere's the paradox faced by the creator of JavaScript:\n\n- There are many things one would want to do with a primitive like a string or a number. It would be great to access them as methods.\n- Primitives must be as fast and lightweight as possible.\n\nThe solution looks a little bit awkward, but here it is:\n\n1. Primitives are still primitive. A single value, as desired.\n2. The language allows access to methods and properties of strings, numbers, booleans and symbols.\n3. In order for that to work, a special \"object wrapper\" that provides the extra functionality is created, and then is destroyed.\n\nThe \"object wrappers\" are different for each primitive type and are called: `String`, `Number`, `Boolean` and `Symbol`. Thus, they provide different sets of methods.\n\nFor instance, there exists a string method [str.toUpperCase()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase) that returns a capitalized `str`.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"Hello\";\n\nalert( str.toUpperCase() ); // HELLO\n```\n\nSimple, right? Here's what actually happens in `str.toUpperCase()`:\n\n1. The string `str` is a primitive. So in the moment of accessing its property, a special object is created that knows the value of the string, and has useful methods, like `toUpperCase()`.\n2. That method runs and returns a new string (shown by `alert`).\n3. The special object is destroyed, leaving the primitive `str` alone.\n\nSo primitives can provide methods, but they still remain lightweight.\n\nThe JavaScript engine highly optimizes this process. It may even skip the creation of the extra object at all. But it must still adhere to the specification and behave as if it creates one.\n\nA number has methods of its own, for instance, [toFixed(n)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed) rounds the number to the given precision:\n\n```js run\nlet n = 1.23456;\n\nalert( n.toFixed(2) ); // 1.23\n```\n\nWe'll see more specific methods in chapters <info:number> and <info:string>.\n\n\n````warn header=\"Constructors `String/Number/Boolean` are for internal use only\"\nSome languages like Java allow us to explicitly create \"wrapper objects\" for primitives using a syntax like `new Number(1)` or `new Boolean(false)`.\n\nIn JavaScript, that's also possible for historical reasons, but highly **unrecommended**. Things will go crazy in several places.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nalert( typeof 0 ); // \"number\"\n\nalert( typeof new Number(0) ); // \"object\"!\n```\n\nObjects are always truthy in `if`, so here the alert will show up:\n\n```js run\nlet zero = new Number(0);\n\nif (zero) { // zero is true, because it's an object\n  alert( \"zero is truthy!?!\" );\n}\n```\n\nOn the other hand, using the same functions `String/Number/Boolean` without `new` is a totally sane and useful thing. They convert a value to the corresponding type: to a string, a number, or a boolean (primitive).\n\nFor example, this is entirely valid:\n```js\nlet num = Number(\"123\"); // convert a string to number\n```\n````\n\n\n````warn header=\"null/undefined have no methods\"\nThe special primitives `null` and `undefined` are exceptions. They have no corresponding \"wrapper objects\" and provide no methods. In a sense, they are \"the most primitive\".\n\nAn attempt to access a property of such value would give the error:\n\n```js run\nalert(null.test); // error\n````\n\n## Summary\n\n- Primitives except `null` and `undefined` provide many helpful methods. We will study those in the upcoming chapters.\n- Formally, these methods work via temporary objects, but JavaScript engines are well tuned to optimize that internally, so they are not expensive to call.",

        "content": "\n\nIn modern JavaScript, there are two types of numbers:\n\n1. Regular numbers in JavaScript are stored in 64-bit format [IEEE-754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-2008_revision), also known as \"double precision floating point numbers\". These are numbers that we're using most of the time, and we'll talk about them in this chapter.\n\n2. BigInt numbers, to represent integers of arbitrary length. They are sometimes needed, because a regular number can't exceed <code>2<sup>53</sup></code> or be less than <code>-2<sup>53</sup></code>. As bigints are used in few special areas, we devote them a special chapter <info:bigint>.\n\nSo here we'll talk about regular numbers. Let's expand our knowledge of them.\n\n## More ways to write a number\n\nImagine we need to write 1 billion. The obvious way is:\n\n```js\nlet billion = 1000000000;\n```\n\nBut in real life, we usually avoid writing a long string of zeroes as it's easy to mistype. Also, we are lazy. We will usually write something like `\"1bn\"` for a billion or `\"7.3bn\"` for 7 billion 300 million. The same is true for most large numbers.\n\nIn JavaScript, we shorten a number by appending the letter `\"e\"` to the number and specifying the zeroes count:\n\n```js run\nlet billion = 1e9;  // 1 billion, literally: 1 and 9 zeroes\n\nalert( 7.3e9 );  // 7.3 billions (7,300,000,000)\n```\n\nIn other words, `\"e\"` multiplies the number by `1` with the given zeroes count.\n\n```js\n1e3 = 1 * 1000\n1.23e6 = 1.23 * 1000000\n```\n\nNow let's write something very small. Say, 1 microsecond (one millionth of a second):\n\n```js\nlet ms = 0.000001;\n```\n\nJust like before, using `\"e\"` can help. If we'd like to avoid writing the zeroes explicitly, we could say the same as:\n\n```js\nlet ms = 1e-6; // six zeroes to the left from 1\n```\n\nIf we count the zeroes in `0.000001`, there are 6 of them. So naturally it's `1e-6`.  \n\nIn other words, a negative number after `\"e\"` means a division by 1 with the given number of zeroes:\n\n```js\n// -3 divides by 1 with 3 zeroes\n1e-3 = 1 / 1000 (=0.001)\n\n// -6 divides by 1 with 6 zeroes\n1.23e-6 = 1.23 / 1000000 (=0.00000123)\n```\n\n### Hex, binary and octal numbers\n\n[Hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) numbers are widely used in JavaScript to represent colors, encode characters, and for many other things. So naturally, there exists a shorter way to write them: `0x` and then the number.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nalert( 0xff ); // 255\nalert( 0xFF ); // 255 (the same, case doesn't matter)\n```\n\nBinary and octal numeral systems are rarely used, but also supported using the `0b` and `0o` prefixes:\n\n\n```js run\nlet a = 0b11111111; // binary form of 255\nlet b = 0o377; // octal form of 255\n\nalert( a == b ); // true, the same number 255 at both sides\n```\n\nThere are only 3 numeral systems with such support. For other numeral systems, we should use the function `parseInt` (which we will see later in this chapter).\n\n## toString(base)\n\nThe method `num.toString(base)` returns a string representation of `num` in the numeral system with the given `base`.\n\nFor example:\n```js run\nlet num = 255;\n\nalert( num.toString(16) );  // ff\nalert( num.toString(2) );   // 11111111\n```\n\nThe `base` can vary from `2` to `36`. By default it's `10`.\n\nCommon use cases for this are:\n\n- **base=16** is used for hex colors, character encodings etc, digits can be `0..9` or `A..F`.\n- **base=2** is mostly for debugging bitwise operations, digits can be `0` or `1`.\n- **base=36** is the maximum, digits can be `0..9` or `A..Z`. The whole latin alphabet is used to represent a number. A funny, but useful case for `36` is when we need to turn a long numeric identifier into something shorter, for example to make a short url. Can simply represent it in the numeral system with base `36`:\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( 123456..toString(36) ); // 2n9c\n    ```\n\n```warn header=\"Two dots to call a method\"\nPlease note that two dots in `123456..toString(36)` is not a typo. If we want to call a method directly on a number, like `toString` in the example above, then we need to place two dots `..` after it.\n\nIf we placed a single dot: `123456.toString(36)`, then there would be an error, because JavaScript syntax implies the decimal part after the first dot. And if we place one more dot, then JavaScript knows that the decimal part is empty and now goes the method.\n\nAlso could write `(123456).toString(36)`.\n```\n\n## Rounding\n\nOne of the most used operations when working with numbers is rounding.\n\nThere are several built-in functions for rounding:\n\n`Math.floor`\n: Rounds down: `3.1` becomes `3`, and `-1.1` becomes `-2`.\n\n`Math.ceil`\n: Rounds up: `3.1` becomes `4`, and `-1.1` becomes `-1`.\n\n`Math.round`\n: Rounds to the nearest integer: `3.1` becomes `3`, `3.6` becomes `4` and `-1.1` becomes `-1`.\n\n`Math.trunc` (not supported by Internet Explorer)\n: Removes anything after the decimal point without rounding: `3.1` becomes `3`, `-1.1` becomes `-1`.\n\nHere's the table to summarize the differences between them:\n\n|   | `Math.floor` | `Math.ceil` | `Math.round` | `Math.trunc` |\n|---|---------|--------|---------|---------|\n|`3.1`|  `3`    |   `4`  |    `3`  |   `3`   |\n|`3.6`|  `3`    |   `4`  |    `4`  |   `3`   |\n|`-1.1`|  `-2`    |   `-1`  |    `-1`  |   `-1`   |\n|`-1.6`|  `-2`    |   `-1`  |    `-2`  |   `-1`   |\n\n\nThese functions cover all of the possible ways to deal with the decimal part of a number. But what if we'd like to round the number to `n-th` digit after the decimal?\n\nFor instance, we have `1.2345` and want to round it to 2 digits, getting only `1.23`.\n\nThere are two ways to do so:\n\n1. Multiply-and-divide.\n\n    For example, to round the number to the 2nd digit after the decimal, we can multiply the number by `100`, call the rounding function and then divide it back.\n    ```js run\n    let num = 1.23456;\n\n    alert( Math.floor(num * 100) / 100 ); // 1.23456 -> 123.456 -> 123 -> 1.23\n    ```\n\n2. The method [toFixed(n)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed) rounds the number to `n` digits after the point and returns a string representation of the result.\n\n    ```js run\n    let num = 12.34;\n    alert( num.toFixed(1) ); // \"12.3\"\n    ```\n\n    This rounds up or down to the nearest value, similar to `Math.round`:\n\n    ```js run\n    let num = 12.36;\n    alert( num.toFixed(1) ); // \"12.4\"\n    ```\n\n    Please note that result of `toFixed` is a string. If the decimal part is shorter than required, zeroes are appended to the end:\n\n    ```js run\n    let num = 12.34;\n    alert( num.toFixed(5) ); // \"12.34000\", added zeroes to make exactly 5 digits\n    ```\n\n    We can convert it to a number using the unary plus or a `Number()` call: `+num.toFixed(5)`.\n\n## Imprecise calculations\n\nInternally, a number is represented in 64-bit format [IEEE-754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-2008_revision), so there are exactly 64 bits to store a number: 52 of them are used to store the digits, 11 of them store the position of the decimal point (they are zero for integer numbers), and 1 bit is for the sign.\n\nIf a number is too big, it would overflow the 64-bit storage, potentially giving an infinity:\n\n```js run\nalert( 1e500 ); // Infinity\n```\n\nWhat may be a little less obvious, but happens quite often, is the loss of precision.\n\nConsider this (falsy!) test:\n\n```js run\nalert( 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3 ); // *!*false*/!*\n```\n\nThat's right, if we check whether the sum of `0.1` and `0.2` is `0.3`, we get `false`.\n\nStrange! What is it then if not `0.3`?\n\n```js run\nalert( 0.1 + 0.2 ); // 0.30000000000000004\n```\n\nOuch! There are more consequences than an incorrect comparison here. Imagine you're making an e-shopping site and the visitor puts `$0.10` and `$0.20` goods into their cart. The order total will be `$0.30000000000000004`. That would surprise anyone.\n\nBut why does this happen?\n\nA number is stored in memory in its binary form, a sequence of bits - ones and zeroes. But fractions like `0.1`, `0.2` that look simple in the decimal numeric system are actually unending fractions in their binary form.\n\nIn other words, what is `0.1`? It is one divided by ten `1/10`, one-tenth. In decimal numeral system such numbers are easily representable. Compare it to one-third: `1/3`. It becomes an endless fraction `0.33333(3)`.\n\nSo, division by powers `10` is guaranteed to work well in the decimal system, but division by `3` is not. For the same reason, in the binary numeral system, the division by powers of `2` is guaranteed to work, but `1/10` becomes an endless binary fraction.\n\nThere's just no way to store *exactly 0.1* or *exactly 0.2* using the binary system, just like there is no way to store one-third as a decimal fraction.\n\nThe numeric format IEEE-754 solves this by rounding to the nearest possible number. These rounding rules normally don't allow us to see that \"tiny precision loss\", but it exists.\n\nWe can see this in action:\n```js run\nalert( 0.1.toFixed(20) ); // 0.10000000000000000555\n```\n\nAnd when we sum two numbers, their \"precision losses\" add up.\n\nThat's why `0.1 + 0.2` is not exactly `0.3`.\n\n```smart header=\"Not only JavaScript\"\nThe same issue exists in many other programming languages.\n\nPHP, Java, C, Perl, Ruby give exactly the same result, because they are based on the same numeric format.\n```\n\nCan we work around the problem? Sure, the most reliable method is to round the result with the help of a method [toFixed(n)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed):\n\n```js run\nlet sum = 0.1 + 0.2;\nalert( sum.toFixed(2) ); // 0.30\n```\n\nPlease note that `toFixed` always returns a string. It ensures that it has 2 digits after the decimal point. That's actually convenient if we have an e-shopping and need to show `$0.30`. For other cases, we can use the unary plus to coerce it into a number:\n\n```js run\nlet sum = 0.1 + 0.2;\nalert( +sum.toFixed(2) ); // 0.3\n```\n\nWe also can temporarily multiply the numbers by 100 (or a bigger number) to turn them into integers, do the maths, and then divide back. Then, as we're doing maths with integers, the error somewhat decreases, but we still get it on division:\n\n```js run\nalert( (0.1 * 10 + 0.2 * 10) / 10 ); // 0.3\nalert( (0.28 * 100 + 0.14 * 100) / 100); // 0.4200000000000001\n```\n\nSo, multiply/divide approach reduces the error, but doesn't remove it totally.\n\nSometimes we could try to evade fractions at all. Like if we're dealing with a shop, then we can store prices in cents instead of dollars. But what if we apply a discount of 30%? In practice, totally evading fractions is rarely possible. Just round them to cut \"tails\" when needed.\n\n````smart header=\"The funny thing\"\nTry running this:\n\n```js run\n// Hello! I'm a self-increasing number!\nalert( 9999999999999999 ); // shows 10000000000000000\n```\n\nThis suffers from the same issue: a loss of precision. There are 64 bits for the number, 52 of them can be used to store digits, but that's not enough. So the least significant digits disappear.\n\nJavaScript doesn't trigger an error in such events. It does its best to fit the number into the desired format, but unfortunately, this format is not big enough.\n````\n\n```smart header=\"Two zeroes\"\nAnother funny consequence of the internal representation of numbers is the existence of two zeroes: `0` and `-0`.\n\nThat's because a sign is represented by a single bit, so it can be set or not set for any number including a zero.\n\nIn most cases the distinction is unnoticeable, because operators are suited to treat them as the same.\n```\n\n## Tests: isFinite and isNaN\n\nRemember these two special numeric values?\n\n- `Infinity` (and `-Infinity`) is a special numeric value that is greater (less) than anything.\n- `NaN` represents an error.\n\nThey belong to the type `number`, but are not \"normal\" numbers, so there are special functions to check for them:\n\n\n- `isNaN(value)` converts its argument to a number and then tests it for being `NaN`:\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( isNaN(NaN) ); // true\n    alert( isNaN(\"str\") ); // true\n    ```\n\n    But do we need this function? Can't we just use the comparison `=== NaN`? Sorry, but the answer is no. The value `NaN` is unique in that it does not equal anything, including itself:\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( NaN === NaN ); // false\n    ```\n\n- `isFinite(value)` converts its argument to a number and returns `true` if it's a regular number, not `NaN/Infinity/-Infinity`:\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( isFinite(\"15\") ); // true\n    alert( isFinite(\"str\") ); // false, because a special value: NaN\n    alert( isFinite(Infinity) ); // false, because a special value: Infinity\n    ```\n\nSometimes `isFinite` is used to validate whether a string value is a regular number:\n\n\n```js run\nlet num = +prompt(\"Enter a number\", '');\n\n// will be true unless you enter Infinity, -Infinity or not a number\nalert( isFinite(num) );\n```\n\nPlease note that an empty or a space-only string is treated as `0` in all numeric functions including `isFinite`.  \n\n```smart header=\"Compare with `Object.is`\"\n\nThere is a special built-in method [`Object.is`](mdn:js/Object/is) that compares values like `===`, but is more reliable for two edge cases:\n\n1. It works with `NaN`: `Object.is(NaN, NaN) === true`, that's a good thing.\n2. Values `0` and `-0` are different: `Object.is(0, -0) === false`, technically that's true, because internally the number has a sign bit that may be different even if all other bits are zeroes.\n\nIn all other cases, `Object.is(a, b)` is the same as `a === b`.\n\nThis way of comparison is often used in JavaScript specification. When an internal algorithm needs to compare two values for being exactly the same, it uses `Object.is` (internally called [SameValue](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-samevalue)).\n```\n\n\n## parseInt and parseFloat\n\nNumeric conversion using a plus `+` or `Number()` is strict. If a value is not exactly a number, it fails:\n\n```js run\nalert( +\"100px\" ); // NaN\n```\n\nThe sole exception is spaces at the beginning or at the end of the string, as they are ignored.\n\nBut in real life we often have values in units, like `\"100px\"` or `\"12pt\"` in CSS. Also in many countries the currency symbol goes after the amount, so we have `\"19€\"` and would like to extract a numeric value out of that.\n\nThat's what `parseInt` and `parseFloat` are for.\n\nThey \"read\" a number from a string until they can't. In case of an error, the gathered number is returned. The function `parseInt` returns an integer, whilst `parseFloat` will return a floating-point number:\n\n```js run\nalert( parseInt('100px') ); // 100\nalert( parseFloat('12.5em') ); // 12.5\n\nalert( parseInt('12.3') ); // 12, only the integer part is returned\nalert( parseFloat('12.3.4') ); // 12.3, the second point stops the reading\n```\n\nThere are situations when `parseInt/parseFloat` will return `NaN`. It happens when no digits could be read:\n\n```js run\nalert( parseInt('a123') ); // NaN, the first symbol stops the process\n```\n\n````smart header=\"The second argument of `parseInt(str, radix)`\"\nThe `parseInt()` function has an optional second parameter. It specifies the base of the numeral system, so `parseInt` can also parse strings of hex numbers, binary numbers and so on:\n\n```js run\nalert( parseInt('0xff', 16) ); // 255\nalert( parseInt('ff', 16) ); // 255, without 0x also works\n\nalert( parseInt('2n9c', 36) ); // 123456\n```\n````\n\n## Other math functions\n\nJavaScript has a built-in [Math](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math) object which contains a small library of mathematical functions and constants.\n\nA few examples:\n\n`Math.random()`\n: Returns a random number from 0 to 1 (not including 1)\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( Math.random() ); // 0.1234567894322\n    alert( Math.random() ); // 0.5435252343232\n    alert( Math.random() ); // ... (any random numbers)\n    ```\n\n`Math.max(a, b, c...)` / `Math.min(a, b, c...)`\n: Returns the greatest/smallest from the arbitrary number of arguments.\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( Math.max(3, 5, -10, 0, 1) ); // 5\n    alert( Math.min(1, 2) ); // 1\n    ```\n\n`Math.pow(n, power)`\n: Returns `n` raised the given power\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( Math.pow(2, 10) ); // 2 in power 10 = 1024\n    ```\n\nThere are more functions and constants in `Math` object, including trigonometry, which you can find in the [docs for the Math](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math) object.\n\n## Summary\n\nTo write numbers with many zeroes:\n\n- Append `\"e\"` with the zeroes count to the number. Like: `123e6` is the same as `123` with 6 zeroes `123000000`.\n- A negative number after `\"e\"` causes the number to be divided by 1 with given zeroes. E.g. `123e-6` means `0.000123` (`123` millionths).\n\nFor different numeral systems:\n\n- Can write numbers directly in hex (`0x`), octal (`0o`) and binary (`0b`) systems.\n- `parseInt(str, base)` parses the string `str` into an integer in numeral system with given `base`, `2 ≤ base ≤ 36`.\n- `num.toString(base)` converts a number to a string in the numeral system with the given `base`.\n\nFor converting values like `12pt` and `100px` to a number:\n\n- Use `parseInt/parseFloat` for the \"soft\" conversion, which reads a number from a string and then returns the value they could read before the error.\n\nFor fractions:\n\n- Round using `Math.floor`, `Math.ceil`, `Math.trunc`, `Math.round` or `num.toFixed(precision)`.\n- Make sure to remember there's a loss of precision when working with fractions.\n\nMore mathematical functions:\n\n- See the [Math](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math) object when you need them.

        "content": "\n\nIn JavaScript, the textual data is stored as strings. There is no separate type for a single character.\n\nThe internal format for strings is always [UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16), it is not tied to the page encoding.\n\n## Quotes\n\nLet's recall the kinds of quotes.\n\nStrings can be enclosed within either single quotes, double quotes or backticks:\n\n```js\nlet single = 'single-quoted';\nlet double = \"double-quoted\";\n\nlet backticks = `backticks`;\n```\n\nSingle and double quotes are essentially the same. Backticks, however, allow us to embed any expression into the string, by wrapping it in `${…}`:\n\n```js run\nfunction sum(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nalert(`1 + 2 = ${sum(1, 2)}.`); // 1 + 2 = 3.\n```\n\nAnother advantage of using backticks is that they allow a string to span multiple lines:\n\n```js run\nlet guestList = `Guests:\n * John\n * Pete\n * Mary\n`;\n\nalert(guestList); // a list of guests, multiple lines\n```\n\nLooks natural, right? But single or double quotes do not work this way.\n\nIf we use them and try to use multiple lines, there'll be an error:\n\n```js run\nlet guestList = \"Guests: // Error: Unexpected token ILLEGAL\n  * John\";\n```\n\nSingle and double quotes come from ancient times of language creation when the need for multiline strings was not taken into account. Backticks appeared much later and thus are more versatile.\n\nBackticks also allow us to specify a \"template function\" before the first backtick. The syntax is: <code>func&#96;string&#96;</code>. The function `func` is called automatically, receives the string and embedded expressions and can process them. This is called \"tagged templates\". This feature makes it easier to implement custom templating, but is rarely used in practice. You can read more about it in the [manual](mdn:/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates). \n\n## Special characters\n\nIt is still possible to create multiline strings with single and double quotes by using a so-called \"newline character\", written as `\\n`, which denotes a line break:\n\n```js run\nlet guestList = \"Guests:\\n * John\\n * Pete\\n * Mary\";\n\nalert(guestList); // a multiline list of guests\n```\n\nFor example, these two lines are equal, just written differently:\n\n```js run\nlet str1 = \"Hello\\nWorld\"; // two lines using a \"newline symbol\"\n\n// two lines using a normal newline and backticks\nlet str2 = `Hello\nWorld`;\n\nalert(str1 == str2); // true\n```\n\nThere are other, less common \"special\" characters.\n\nHere's the full list:\n\n| Character | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n|`\\n`|New line|\n|`\\r`|Carriage return: not used alone. Windows text files use a combination of two characters `\\r\\n` to represent a line break. |\n|`\\'`, `\\\"`|Quotes|\n|`\\\\`|Backslash|\n|`\\t`|Tab|\n|`\\b`, `\\f`, `\\v`| Backspace, Form Feed, Vertical Tab -- kept for compatibility, not used nowadays. |\n|`\\xXX`|Unicode character with the given hexadecimal unicode `XX`, e.g. `'\\x7A'` is the same as `'z'`.|\n|`\\uXXXX`|A unicode symbol with the hex code `XXXX` in UTF-16 encoding, for instance `\\u00A9` -- is a unicode for the copyright symbol `©`. It must be exactly 4 hex digits. |\n|`\\u{X…XXXXXX}` (1 to 6 hex characters)|A unicode symbol with the given UTF-32 encoding. Some rare characters are encoded with two unicode symbols, taking 4 bytes. This way we can insert long codes. |\n\nExamples with unicode:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"\\u00A9\" ); // ©\nalert( \"\\u{20331}\" ); // 佫, a rare Chinese hieroglyph (long unicode)\nalert( \"\\u{1F60D}\" ); // 😍, a smiling face symbol (another long unicode)\n```\n\nAll special characters start with a backslash character `\\`. It is also called an \"escape character\".\n\nWe might also use it if we wanted to insert a quote into the string.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nalert( 'I*!*\\'*/!*m the Walrus!' ); // *!*I'm*/!* the Walrus!\n```\n\nAs you can see, we have to prepend the inner quote by the backslash `\\'`, because otherwise it would indicate the string end.\n\nOf course, only to the quotes that are the same as the enclosing ones need to be escaped. So, as a more elegant solution, we could switch to double quotes or backticks instead:\n\n```js run\nalert( `I'm the Walrus!` ); // I'm the Walrus!\n```\n\nNote that the backslash `\\` serves for the correct reading of the string by JavaScript, then disappears. The in-memory string has no `\\`. You can clearly see that in `alert` from the examples above.\n\nBut what if we need to show an actual backslash `\\` within the string?\n\nThat's possible, but we need to double it like `\\\\`:\n\n```js run\nalert( `The backslash: \\\\` ); // The backslash: \\\n```\n\n## String length\n\nThe `length` property has the string length:\n\n```js run\nalert( `My\\n`.length ); // 3\n```\n\nNote that `\\n` is a single \"special\" character, so the length is indeed `3`.\n\n```warn header=\"`length` is a property\"\nPeople with a background in some other languages sometimes mistype by calling `str.length()` instead of just `str.length`. That doesn't work.\n\nPlease note that `str.length` is a numeric property, not a function. There is no need to add parenthesis after it.\n```\n\n## Accessing characters\n\nTo get a character at position `pos`, use square brackets `[pos]` or call the method [str.charAt(pos)](mdn:js/String/charAt). The first character starts from the zero position:\n\n```js run\nlet str = `Hello`;\n\n// the first character\nalert( str[0] ); // H\nalert( str.charAt(0) ); // H\n\n// the last character\nalert( str[str.length - 1] ); // o\n```\n\nThe square brackets are a modern way of getting a character, while `charAt` exists mostly for historical reasons.\n\nThe only difference between them is that if no character is found, `[]` returns `undefined`, and `charAt` returns an empty string:\n\n```js run\nlet str = `Hello`;\n\nalert( str[1000] ); // undefined\nalert( str.charAt(1000) ); // '' (an empty string)\n```\n\nWe can also iterate over characters using `for..of`:\n\n```js run\nfor (let char of \"Hello\") {\n  alert(char); // H,e,l,l,o (char becomes \"H\", then \"e\", then \"l\" etc)\n}\n```\n\n## Strings are immutable\n\nStrings can't be changed in JavaScript. It is impossible to change a character.\n\nLet's try it to show that it doesn't work:\n\n```js run\nlet str = 'Hi';\n\nstr[0] = 'h'; // error\nalert( str[0] ); // doesn't work\n```\n\nThe usual workaround is to create a whole new string and assign it to `str` instead of the old one.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet str = 'Hi';\n\nstr = 'h' + str[1]; // replace the string\n\nalert( str ); // hi\n```\n\nIn the following sections we'll see more examples of this.\n\n## Changing the case\n\nMethods [toLowerCase()](mdn:js/String/toLowerCase) and [toUpperCase()](mdn:js/String/toUpperCase) change the case:\n\n```js run\nalert( 'Interface'.toUpperCase() ); // INTERFACE\nalert( 'Interface'.toLowerCase() ); // interface\n```\n\nOr, if we want a single character lowercased:\n\n```js\nalert( 'Interface'[0].toLowerCase() ); // 'i'\n```\n\n## Searching for a substring\n\nThere are multiple ways to look for a substring within a string.\n\n### str.indexOf\n\nThe first method is [str.indexOf(substr, pos)](mdn:js/String/indexOf).\n\nIt looks for the `substr` in `str`, starting from the given position `pos`, and returns the position where the match was found or `-1` if nothing can be found.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet str = 'Widget with id';\n\nalert( str.indexOf('Widget') ); // 0, because 'Widget' is found at the beginning\nalert( str.indexOf('widget') ); // -1, not found, the search is case-sensitive\n\nalert( str.indexOf(\"id\") ); // 1, \"id\" is found at the position 1 (..idget with id)\n```\n\nThe optional second parameter allows us to search starting from the given position.\n\nFor instance, the first occurrence of `\"id\"` is at position `1`. To look for the next occurrence, let's start the search from position `2`:\n\n```js run\nlet str = 'Widget with id';\n\nalert( str.indexOf('id', 2) ) // 12\n```\n\nIf we're interested in all occurrences, we can run `indexOf` in a loop. Every new call is made with the position after the previous match:\n\n```js run\nlet str = 'As sly as a fox, as strong as an ox';\n\nlet target = 'as'; // let's look for it\n\nlet pos = 0;\nwhile (true) {\n  let foundPos = str.indexOf(target, pos);\n  if (foundPos == -1) break;\n\n  alert( `Found at ${foundPos}` );\n  pos = foundPos + 1; // continue the search from the next position\n}\n```\n\nThe same algorithm can be layed out shorter:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"As sly as a fox, as strong as an ox\";\nlet target = \"as\";\n\n*!*\nlet pos = -1;\nwhile ((pos = str.indexOf(target, pos + 1)) != -1) {\n  alert( pos );\n}\n*/!*\n```\n\n```smart header=\"`str.lastIndexOf(substr, position)`\"\nThere is also a similar method [str.lastIndexOf(substr, position)](mdn:js/String/lastIndexOf) that searches from the end of a string to its beginning.\n\nIt would list the occurrences in the reverse order.\n```\n\nThere is a slight inconvenience with `indexOf` in the `if` test. We can't put it in the `if` like this:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"Widget with id\";\n\nif (str.indexOf(\"Widget\")) {\n    alert(\"We found it\"); // doesn't work!\n}\n```\n\nThe `alert` in the example above doesn't show because `str.indexOf(\"Widget\")` returns `0` (meaning that it found the match at the starting position). Right, but `if` considers `0` to be `false`.\n\nSo, we should actually check for `-1`, like this:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"Widget with id\";\n\n*!*\nif (str.indexOf(\"Widget\") != -1) {\n*/!*\n    alert(\"We found it\"); // works now!\n}\n```\n\n#### The bitwise NOT trick\n\nOne of the old tricks used here is the [bitwise NOT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators#Bitwise_NOT) `~` operator. It converts the number to a 32-bit integer (removes the decimal part if exists) and then reverses all bits in its binary representation.\n\nIn practice, that means a simple thing: for 32-bit integers `~n` equals `-(n+1)`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nalert( ~2 ); // -3, the same as -(2+1)\nalert( ~1 ); // -2, the same as -(1+1)\nalert( ~0 ); // -1, the same as -(0+1)\n*!*\nalert( ~-1 ); // 0, the same as -(-1+1)\n*/!*\n```\n\nAs we can see, `~n` is zero only if `n == -1` (that's for any 32-bit signed integer `n`).\n\nSo, the test `if ( ~str.indexOf(\"...\") )` is truthy only if the result of `indexOf` is not `-1`. In other words, when there is a match.\n\nPeople use it to shorten `indexOf` checks:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"Widget\";\n\nif (~str.indexOf(\"Widget\")) {\n  alert( 'Found it!' ); // works\n}\n```\n\nIt is usually not recommended to use language features in a non-obvious way, but this particular trick is widely used in old code, so we should understand it.\n\nJust remember: `if (~str.indexOf(...))` reads as \"if found\".\n\nTo be precise though, as big numbers are truncated to 32 bits by `~` operator, there exist other numbers that give `0`, the smallest is `~4294967295=0`. That makes such check is correct only if a string is not that long.\n\nRight now we can see this trick only in the old code, as modern JavaScript provides `.includes` method (see below).\n\n### includes, startsWith, endsWith\n\nThe more modern method [str.includes(substr, pos)](mdn:js/String/includes) returns `true/false` depending on whether `str` contains `substr` within.\n\nIt's the right choice if we need to test for the match, but don't need its position:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"Widget with id\".includes(\"Widget\") ); // true\n\nalert( \"Hello\".includes(\"Bye\") ); // false\n```\n\nThe optional second argument of `str.includes` is the position to start searching from:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"Widget\".includes(\"id\") ); // true\nalert( \"Widget\".includes(\"id\", 3) ); // false, from position 3 there is no \"id\"\n```\n\nThe methods [str.startsWith](mdn:js/String/startsWith) and [str.endsWith](mdn:js/String/endsWith) do exactly what they say:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"Widget\".startsWith(\"Wid\") ); // true, \"Widget\" starts with \"Wid\"\nalert( \"Widget\".endsWith(\"get\") ); // true, \"Widget\" ends with \"get\"\n```\n\n## Getting a substring\n\nThere are 3 methods in JavaScript to get a substring: `substring`, `substr` and `slice`.\n\n`str.slice(start [, end])`\n: Returns the part of the string from `start` to (but not including) `end`.\n\n    For instance:\n\n    ```js run\n    let str = \"stringify\";\n    alert( str.slice(0, 5) ); // 'strin', the substring from 0 to 5 (not including 5)\n    alert( str.slice(0, 1) ); // 's', from 0 to 1, but not including 1, so only character at 0\n    ```\n\n    If there is no second argument, then `slice` goes till the end of the string:\n\n    ```js run\n    let str = \"st*!*ringify*/!*\";\n    alert( str.slice(2) ); // 'ringify', from the 2nd position till the end\n    ```\n\n    Negative values for `start/end` are also possible. They mean the position is counted from the string end:\n\n    ```js run\n    let str = \"strin*!*gif*/!*y\";\n\n    // start at the 4th position from the right, end at the 1st from the right\n    alert( str.slice(-4, -1) ); // 'gif'\n    ```\n\n`str.substring(start [, end])`\n: Returns the part of the string *between* `start` and `end`.\n\n    This is almost the same as `slice`, but it allows `start` to be greater than `end`.\n\n    For instance:\n\n    ```js run\n    let str = \"st*!*ring*/!*ify\";\n\n    // these are same for substring\n    alert( str.substring(2, 6) ); // \"ring\"\n    alert( str.substring(6, 2) ); // \"ring\"\n\n    // ...but not for slice:\n    alert( str.slice(2, 6) ); // \"ring\" (the same)\n    alert( str.slice(6, 2) ); // \"\" (an empty string)\n\n    ```\n\n    Negative arguments are (unlike slice) not supported, they are treated as `0`.\n\n`str.substr(start [, length])`\n: Returns the part of the string from `start`, with the given `length`.\n\n    In contrast with the previous methods, this one allows us to specify the `length` instead of the ending position:\n\n    ```js run\n    let str = \"st*!*ring*/!*ify\";\n    alert( str.substr(2, 4) ); // 'ring', from the 2nd position get 4 characters\n    ```\n\n    The first argument may be negative, to count from the end:\n\n    ```js run\n    let str = \"strin*!*gi*/!*fy\";\n    alert( str.substr(-4, 2) ); // 'gi', from the 4th position get 2 characters\n    ```\n\nLet's recap these methods to avoid any confusion:\n\n| method | selects... | negatives |\n|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| `slice(start, end)` | from `start` to `end` (not including `end`) | allows negatives |\n| `substring(start, end)` | between `start` and `end` | negative values mean `0` |\n| `substr(start, length)` | from `start` get `length` characters | allows negative `start` |\n\n```smart header=\"Which one to choose?\"\nAll of them can do the job. Formally, `substr` has a minor drawback: it is described not in the core JavaScript specification, but in Annex B, which covers browser-only features that exist mainly for historical reasons. So, non-browser environments may fail to support it. But in practice it works everywhere.\n\nOf the other two variants, `slice` is a little bit more flexible, it allows negative arguments and shorter to write. So, it's enough to remember solely `slice` of these three methods.\n```\n\n## Comparing strings\n\nAs we know from the chapter <info:comparison>, strings are compared character-by-character in alphabetical order.\n\nAlthough, there are some oddities.\n\n1. A lowercase letter is always greater than the uppercase:\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( 'a' > 'Z' ); // true\n    ```\n\n2. Letters with diacritical marks are \"out of order\":\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( 'Österreich' > 'Zealand' ); // true\n    ```\n\n    This may lead to strange results if we sort these country names. Usually people would expect `Zealand` to come after `Österreich` in the list.\n\nTo understand what happens, let's review the internal representation of strings in JavaScript.\n\nAll strings are encoded using [UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16). That is: each character has a corresponding numeric code. There are special methods that allow to get the character for the code and back.\n\n`str.codePointAt(pos)`\n: Returns the code for the character at position `pos`:\n\n    ```js run\n    // different case letters have different codes\n    alert( \"z\".codePointAt(0) ); // 122\n    alert( \"Z\".codePointAt(0) ); // 90\n    ```\n\n`String.fromCodePoint(code)`\n: Creates a character by its numeric `code`\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( String.fromCodePoint(90) ); // Z\n    ```\n\n    We can also add unicode characters by their codes using `\\u` followed by the hex code:\n\n    ```js run\n    // 90 is 5a in hexadecimal system\n    alert( '\\u005a' ); // Z\n    ```\n\nNow let's see the characters with codes `65..220` (the latin alphabet and a little bit extra) by making a string of them:\n\n```js run\nlet str = '';\n\nfor (let i = 65; i <= 220; i++) {\n  str += String.fromCodePoint(i);\n}\nalert( str );\n// ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~\n// ¡¢£¤¥¦§¨©ª«¬­®¯°±²³´µ¶·¸¹º»¼½¾¿ÀÁÂÃÄÅÆÇÈÉÊËÌÍÎÏÐÑÒÓÔÕÖ×ØÙÚÛÜ\n```\n\nSee? Capital characters go first, then a few special ones, then lowercase characters, and `Ö` near the end of the output.\n\nNow it becomes obvious why `a > Z`.\n\nThe characters are compared by their numeric code. The greater code means that the character is greater. The code for `a` (97) is greater than the code for `Z` (90).\n\n- All lowercase letters go after uppercase letters because their codes are greater.\n- Some letters like `Ö` stand apart from the main alphabet. Here, it's code is greater than anything from `a` to `z`.\n\n### Correct comparisons\n\nThe \"right\" algorithm to do string comparisons is more complex than it may seem, because alphabets are different for different languages.\n\nSo, the browser needs to know the language to compare.\n\nLuckily, all modern browsers (IE10- requires the additional library [Intl.js](https://github.com/andyearnshaw/Intl.js/)) support the internationalization standard [ECMA-402](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/ECMA-402.pdf).\n\nIt provides a special method to compare strings in different languages, following their rules.\n\nThe call [str.localeCompare(str2)](mdn:js/String/localeCompare) returns an integer indicating whether `str` is less, equal or greater than `str2` according to the language rules:\n\n- Returns a negative number if `str` is less than `str2`.\n- Returns a positive number if `str` is greater than `str2`.\n- Returns `0` if they are equivalent.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nalert( 'Österreich'.localeCompare('Zealand') ); // -1\n```\n\nThis method actually has two additional arguments specified in [the documentation](mdn:js/String/localeCompare), which allows it to specify the language (by default taken from the environment, letter order depends on the language) and setup additional rules like case sensitivity or should `\"a\"` and `\"á\"` be treated as the same etc.\n\n## Internals, Unicode\n\n```warn header=\"Advanced knowledge\"\nThe section goes deeper into string internals. This knowledge will be useful for you if you plan to deal with emoji, rare mathematical or hieroglyphic characters or other rare symbols.\n\nYou can skip the section if you don't plan to support them.\n```\n\n### Surrogate pairs\n\nAll frequently used characters have 2-byte codes. Letters in most european languages, numbers, and even most hieroglyphs, have a 2-byte representation.\n\nBut 2 bytes only allow 65536 combinations and that's not enough for every possible symbol. So rare symbols are encoded with a pair of 2-byte characters called \"a surrogate pair\".\n\nThe length of such symbols is `2`:\n\n```js run\nalert( '𝒳'.length ); // 2, MATHEMATICAL SCRIPT CAPITAL X\nalert( '😂'.length ); // 2, FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY\nalert( '𩷶'.length ); // 2, a rare Chinese hieroglyph\n```\n\nNote that surrogate pairs did not exist at the time when JavaScript was created, and thus are not correctly processed by the language!\n\nWe actually have a single symbol in each of the strings above, but the `length` shows a length of `2`.\n\n`String.fromCodePoint` and `str.codePointAt` are few rare methods that deal with surrogate pairs right. They recently appeared in the language. Before them, there were only [String.fromCharCode](mdn:js/String/fromCharCode) and [str.charCodeAt](mdn:js/String/charCodeAt). These methods are actually the same as `fromCodePoint/codePointAt`, but don't work with surrogate pairs.\n\nGetting a symbol can be tricky, because surrogate pairs are treated as two characters:\n\n```js run\nalert( '𝒳'[0] ); // strange symbols...\nalert( '𝒳'[1] ); // ...pieces of the surrogate pair\n```\n\nNote that pieces of the surrogate pair have no meaning without each other. So the alerts in the example above actually display garbage.\n\nTechnically, surrogate pairs are also detectable by their codes: if a character has the code in the interval of `0xd800..0xdbff`, then it is the first part of the surrogate pair. The next character (second part) must have the code in interval `0xdc00..0xdfff`. These intervals are reserved exclusively for surrogate pairs by the standard.\n\nIn the case above:\n\n```js run\n// charCodeAt is not surrogate-pair aware, so it gives codes for parts\n\nalert( '𝒳'.charCodeAt(0).toString(16) ); // d835, between 0xd800 and 0xdbff\nalert( '𝒳'.charCodeAt(1).toString(16) ); // dcb3, between 0xdc00 and 0xdfff\n```\n\nYou will find more ways to deal with surrogate pairs later in the chapter <info:iterable>. There are probably special libraries for that too, but nothing famous enough to suggest here.\n\n### Diacritical marks and normalization\n\nIn many languages there are symbols that are composed of the base character with a mark above/under it.\n\nFor instance, the letter `a` can be the base character for: `àáâäãåā`. Most common \"composite\" character have their own code in the UTF-16 table. But not all of them, because there are too many possible combinations.\n\nTo support arbitrary compositions, UTF-16 allows us to use several unicode characters: the base character followed by one or many \"mark\" characters that \"decorate\" it.\n\nFor instance, if we have `S` followed by the special \"dot above\" character (code `\\u0307`), it is shown as Ṡ.\n\n```js run\nalert( 'S\\u0307' ); // Ṡ\n```\n\nIf we need an additional mark above the letter (or below it) -- no problem, just add the necessary mark character.\n\nFor instance, if we append a character \"dot below\" (code `\\u0323`), then we'll have \"S with dots above and below\": `Ṩ`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nalert( 'S\\u0307\\u0323' ); // Ṩ\n```\n\nThis provides great flexibility, but also an interesting problem: two characters may visually look the same, but be represented with different unicode compositions.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet s1 = 'S\\u0307\\u0323'; // Ṩ, S + dot above + dot below\nlet s2 = 'S\\u0323\\u0307'; // Ṩ, S + dot below + dot above\n\nalert( `s1: ${s1}, s2: ${s2}` );\n\nalert( s1 == s2 ); // false though the characters look identical (?!)\n```\n\nTo solve this, there exists a \"unicode normalization\" algorithm that brings each string to the single \"normal\" form.\n\nIt is implemented by [str.normalize()](mdn:js/String/normalize).\n\n```js run\nalert( \"S\\u0307\\u0323\".normalize() == \"S\\u0323\\u0307\".normalize() ); // true\n```\n\nIt's funny that in our situation `normalize()` actually brings together a sequence of 3 characters to one: `\\u1e68` (S with two dots).\n\n```js run\nalert( \"S\\u0307\\u0323\".normalize().length ); // 1\n\nalert( \"S\\u0307\\u0323\".normalize() == \"\\u1e68\" ); // true\n```\n\nIn reality, this is not always the case. The reason being that the symbol `Ṩ` is \"common enough\", so UTF-16 creators included it in the main table and gave it the code.\n\nIf you want to learn more about normalization rules and variants -- they are described in the appendix of the Unicode standard: [Unicode Normalization Forms](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/), but for most practical purposes the information from this section is enough.\n\n## Summary\n\n- There are 3 types of quotes. Backticks allow a string to span multiple lines and embed expressions `${…}`.\n- Strings in JavaScript are encoded using UTF-16.\n- We can use special characters like `\\n` and insert letters by their unicode using `\\u...`.\n- To get a character, use: `[]`.\n- To get a substring, use: `slice` or `substring`.\n- To lowercase/uppercase a string, use: `toLowerCase/toUpperCase`.\n- To look for a substring, use: `indexOf`, or `includes/startsWith/endsWith` for simple checks.\n- To compare strings according to the language, use: `localeCompare`, otherwise they are compared by character codes.\n\nThere are several other helpful methods in strings:\n\n- `str.trim()` -- removes (\"trims\") spaces from the beginning and end of the string.\n- `str.repeat(n)` -- repeats the string `n` times.\n- ...and more to be found in the [manual](mdn:js/String).\n\nStrings also have methods for doing search/replace with regular expressions.

        "content": "\n\nObjects allow you to store keyed collections of values. That's fine.\n\nBut quite often we find that we need an *ordered collection*, where we have a 1st, a 2nd, a 3rd element and so on. For example, we need that to store a list of something: users, goods, HTML elements etc.\n\nIt is not convenient to use an object here, because it provides no methods to manage the order of elements. We can’t insert a new property “between” the existing ones. Objects are just not meant for such use.\n\nThere exists a special data structure named `Array`, to store ordered collections.\n\n## Declaration\n\nThere are two syntaxes for creating an empty array:\n\n```js\nlet arr = new Array();\nlet arr = [];\n```\n\nAlmost all the time, the second syntax is used. We can supply initial elements in the brackets:\n\n```js\nlet fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Plum\"];\n```\n\nArray elements are numbered, starting with zero.\n\nWe can get an element by its number in square brackets:\n\n```js run\nlet fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Plum\"];\n\nalert( fruits[0] ); // Apple\nalert( fruits[1] ); // Orange\nalert( fruits[2] ); // Plum\n```\n\nWe can replace an element:\n\n```js\nfruits[2] = 'Pear'; // now [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Pear\"]\n```\n\n...Or add a new one to the array:\n\n```js\nfruits[3] = 'Lemon'; // now [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Pear\", \"Lemon\"]\n```\n\nThe total count of the elements in the array is its `length`:\n\n```js run\nlet fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Plum\"];\n\nalert( fruits.length ); // 3\n```\n\nWe can also use `alert` to show the whole array.\n\n```js run\nlet fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Plum\"];\n\nalert( fruits ); // Apple,Orange,Plum\n```\n\nAn array can store elements of any type.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run no-beautify\n// mix of values\nlet arr = [ 'Apple', { name: 'John' }, true, function() { alert('hello'); } ];\n\n// get the object at index 1 and then show its name\nalert( arr[1].name ); // John\n\n// get the function at index 3 and run it\narr[3](); // hello\n```\n\n\n````smart header=\"Trailing comma\"\nAn array, just like an object, may end with a comma:\n```js\nlet fruits = [\n  \"Apple\",\n  \"Orange\",\n  \"Plum\"*!*,*/!*\n];\n```\n\nThe \"trailing comma\" style makes it easier to insert/remove items, because all lines become alike.\n````\n\n\n## Methods pop/push, shift/unshift\n\nA [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) is one of the most common uses of an array. In computer science, this means an ordered collection of elements which supports two operations:\n\n- `push` appends an element to the end.\n- `shift` get an element from the beginning, advancing the queue, so that the 2nd element becomes the 1st.\n\n![](queue.svg)\n\nArrays support both operations.\n\nIn practice we need it very often. For example, a queue of messages that need to be shown on-screen.\n\nThere's another use case for arrays -- the data structure named [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)).\n\nIt supports two operations:\n\n- `push` adds an element to the end.\n- `pop` takes an element from the end.\n\nSo new elements are added or taken always from the \"end\".\n\nA stack is usually illustrated as a pack of cards: new cards are added to the top or taken from the top:\n\n![](stack.svg)\n\nFor stacks, the latest pushed item is received first, that's also called LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. For queues, we have FIFO (First-In-First-Out).\n\nArrays in JavaScript can work both as a queue and as a stack. They allow you to add/remove elements both to/from the beginning or the end.\n\nIn computer science the data structure that allows this, is called [deque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue).\n\n**Methods that work with the end of the array:**\n\n`pop`\n: Extracts the last element of the array and returns it:\n\n    ```js run\n    let fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Pear\"];\n\n    alert( fruits.pop() ); // remove \"Pear\" and alert it\n\n    alert( fruits ); // Apple, Orange\n    ```\n\n`push`\n: Append the element to the end of the array:\n\n    ```js run\n    let fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\"];\n\n    fruits.push(\"Pear\");\n\n    alert( fruits ); // Apple, Orange, Pear\n    ```\n\n    The call `fruits.push(...)` is equal to `fruits[fruits.length] = ...`.\n\n**Methods that work with the beginning of the array:**\n\n`shift`\n: Extracts the first element of the array and returns it:\n\n    ```js run\n    let fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Pear\"];\n\n    alert( fruits.shift() ); // remove Apple and alert it\n\n    alert( fruits ); // Orange, Pear\n    ```\n\n`unshift`\n: Add the element to the beginning of the array:\n\n    ```js run\n    let fruits = [\"Orange\", \"Pear\"];\n\n    fruits.unshift('Apple');\n\n    alert( fruits ); // Apple, Orange, Pear\n    ```\n\nMethods `push` and `unshift` can add multiple elements at once:\n\n```js run\nlet fruits = [\"Apple\"];\n\nfruits.push(\"Orange\", \"Peach\");\nfruits.unshift(\"Pineapple\", \"Lemon\");\n\n// [\"Pineapple\", \"Lemon\", \"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Peach\"]\nalert( fruits );\n```\n\n## Internals\n\nAn array is a special kind of object. The square brackets used to access a property `arr[0]` actually come from the object syntax. That's essentially the same as `obj[key]`, where `arr` is the object, while numbers are used as keys.\n\nThey extend objects providing special methods to work with ordered collections of data and also the `length` property. But at the core it's still an object.\n\nRemember, there are only 7 basic types in JavaScript. Array is an object and thus behaves like an object.\n\nFor instance, it is copied by reference:\n\n```js run\nlet fruits = [\"Banana\"]\n\nlet arr = fruits; // copy by reference (two variables reference the same array)\n\nalert( arr === fruits ); // true\n\narr.push(\"Pear\"); // modify the array by reference\n\nalert( fruits ); // Banana, Pear - 2 items now\n```\n\n...But what makes arrays really  special is their internal representation. The engine tries to store its elements in the contiguous memory area, one after another, just as depicted on the illustrations in this chapter, and there are other optimizations as well, to make arrays work really fast.\n\nBut they all break if we quit working with an array as with an \"ordered collection\" and start working with it as if it were a regular object.\n\nFor instance, technically we can do this:\n\n```js\nlet fruits = []; // make an array\n\nfruits[99999] = 5; // assign a property with the index far greater than its length\n\nfruits.age = 25; // create a property with an arbitrary name\n```\n\nThat's possible, because arrays are objects at their base. We can add any properties to them.\n\nBut the engine will see that we're working with the array as with a regular object. Array-specific optimizations are not suited for such cases and will be turned off, their benefits disappear.\n\nThe ways to misuse an array:\n\n- Add a non-numeric property like `arr.test = 5`.\n- Make holes, like: add `arr[0]` and then `arr[1000]` (and nothing between them).\n- Fill the array in the reverse order, like `arr[1000]`, `arr[999]` and so on.\n\nPlease think of arrays as special structures to work with the *ordered data*. They provide special methods for that. Arrays are carefully tuned inside JavaScript engines to work with contiguous ordered data, please use them this way. And if you need arbitrary keys, chances are high that you actually require a regular object `{}`.\n\n## Performance\n\nMethods `push/pop` run fast, while `shift/unshift` are slow.\n\n![](array-speed.svg)\n\nWhy is it faster to work with the end of an array than with its beginning? Let's see what happens during the execution:\n\n```js\nfruits.shift(); // take 1 element from the start\n```\n\nIt's not enough to take and remove the element with the number `0`. Other elements need to be renumbered as well.\n\nThe `shift` operation must do 3 things:\n\n1. Remove the element with the index `0`.\n2. Move all elements to the left, renumber them from the index `1` to `0`, from `2` to `1` and so on.\n3. Update the `length` property.\n\n![](array-shift.svg)\n\n**The more elements in the array, the more time to move them, more in-memory operations.**\n\nThe similar thing happens with `unshift`: to add an element to the beginning of the array, we need first to move existing elements to the right, increasing their indexes.\n\nAnd what's with `push/pop`? They do not need to move anything. To extract an element from the end, the `pop` method cleans the index and shortens `length`.\n\nThe actions for the `pop` operation:\n\n```js\nfruits.pop(); // take 1 element from the end\n```\n\n![](array-pop.svg)\n\n**The `pop` method does not need to move anything, because other elements keep their indexes. That's why it's blazingly fast.**\n\nThe similar thing with the `push` method.\n\n## Loops\n\nOne of the oldest ways to cycle array items is the `for` loop over indexes:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Pear\"];\n\n*!*\nfor (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n*/!*\n  alert( arr[i] );\n}\n```\n\nBut for arrays there is another form of loop, `for..of`:\n\n```js run\nlet fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Plum\"];\n\n// iterates over array elements\nfor (let fruit of fruits) {\n  alert( fruit );\n}\n```\n\nThe `for..of` doesn't give access to the number of the current element, just its value, but in most cases that's enough. And it's shorter.\n\nTechnically, because arrays are objects, it is also possible to use `for..in`:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Pear\"];\n\n*!*\nfor (let key in arr) {\n*/!*\n  alert( arr[key] ); // Apple, Orange, Pear\n}\n```\n\nBut that's actually a bad idea. There are potential problems with it:\n\n1. The loop `for..in` iterates over *all properties*, not only the numeric ones.\n\n    There are so-called \"array-like\" objects in the browser and in other environments, that *look like arrays*. That is, they have `length` and indexes properties, but they may also have other non-numeric properties and methods, which we usually don't need. The `for..in` loop will list them though. So if we need to work with array-like objects, then these \"extra\" properties can become a problem.\n\n2. The `for..in` loop is optimized for generic objects, not arrays, and thus is 10-100 times slower. Of course, it's still very fast. The speedup may only matter in bottlenecks. But still we should be aware of the difference.\n\nGenerally, we shouldn't use `for..in` for arrays.\n\n\n## A word about \"length\"\n\nThe `length` property automatically updates when we modify the array. To be precise, it is actually not the count of values in the array, but the greatest numeric index plus one.\n\nFor instance, a single element with a large index gives a big length:\n\n```js run\nlet fruits = [];\nfruits[123] = \"Apple\";\n\nalert( fruits.length ); // 124\n```\n\nNote that we usually don't use arrays like that.\n\nAnother interesting thing about the `length` property is that it's writable.\n\nIf we increase it manually, nothing interesting happens. But if we decrease it, the array is truncated. The process is irreversible, here's the example:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\narr.length = 2; // truncate to 2 elements\nalert( arr ); // [1, 2]\n\narr.length = 5; // return length back\nalert( arr[3] ); // undefined: the values do not return\n```\n\nSo, the simplest way to clear the array is: `arr.length = 0;`.\n\n\n## new Array() [#new-array]\n\nThere is one more syntax to create an array:\n\n```js\nlet arr = *!*new Array*/!*(\"Apple\", \"Pear\", \"etc\");\n```\n\nIt's rarely used, because square brackets `[]` are shorter. Also there's a tricky feature with it.\n\nIf `new Array` is called with a single argument which is a number, then it creates an array *without items, but with the given length*.\n\nLet's see how one can shoot themself in the foot:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = new Array(2); // will it create an array of [2] ?\n\nalert( arr[0] ); // undefined! no elements.\n\nalert( arr.length ); // length 2\n```\n\nIn the code above, `new Array(number)` has all elements `undefined`.\n\nTo evade such surprises, we usually use square brackets, unless we really know what we're doing.\n\n## Multidimensional arrays\n\nArrays can have items that are also arrays. We can use it for multidimensional arrays, for example to store matrices:\n\n```js run\nlet matrix = [\n  [1, 2, 3],\n  [4, 5, 6],\n  [7, 8, 9]\n];\n\nalert( matrix[1][1] ); // 5, the central element\n```\n\n## toString\n\nArrays have their own implementation of `toString` method that returns a comma-separated list of elements.\n\nFor instance:\n\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [1, 2, 3];\n\nalert( arr ); // 1,2,3\nalert( String(arr) === '1,2,3' ); // true\n```\n\nAlso, let's try this:\n\n```js run\nalert( [] + 1 ); // \"1\"\nalert( [1] + 1 ); // \"11\"\nalert( [1,2] + 1 ); // \"1,21\"\n```\n\nArrays do not have `Symbol.toPrimitive`, neither a viable `valueOf`, they implement only `toString` conversion, so here `[]` becomes an empty string, `[1]` becomes `\"1\"` and `[1,2]` becomes `\"1,2\"`.\n\nWhen the binary plus `\"+\"` operator adds something to a string, it converts it to a string as well, so the next step looks like this:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"\" + 1 ); // \"1\"\nalert( \"1\" + 1 ); // \"11\"\nalert( \"1,2\" + 1 ); // \"1,21\"\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nArray is a special kind of object, suited to storing and managing ordered data items.\n\n- The declaration:\n\n    ```js\n    // square brackets (usual)\n    let arr = [item1, item2...];\n\n    // new Array (exceptionally rare)\n    let arr = new Array(item1, item2...);\n    ```\n\n    The call to `new Array(number)` creates an array with the given length, but without elements.\n\n- The `length` property is the array length or, to be precise, its last numeric index plus one. It is auto-adjusted by array methods.\n- If we shorten `length` manually, the array is truncated.\n\nWe can use an array as a deque with the following operations:\n\n- `push(...items)` adds `items` to the end.\n- `pop()` removes the element from the end and returns it.\n- `shift()` removes the element from the beginning and returns it.\n- `unshift(...items)` adds `items` to the beginning.\n\nTo loop over the elements of the array:\n  - `for (let i=0; i<arr.length; i++)` -- works fastest, old-browser-compatible.\n  - `for (let item of arr)` -- the modern syntax for items only,\n  - `for (let i in arr)` -- never use.\n\nWe will return to arrays and study more methods to add, remove, extract elements and sort arrays in the chapter <info:array-methods>.",

        "content": "\n\nArrays provide a lot of methods. To make things easier, in this chapter they are split into groups.\n\n## Add/remove items\n\nWe already know methods that add and remove items from the beginning or the end:\n\n- `arr.push(...items)` -- adds items to the end,\n- `arr.pop()` -- extracts an item from the end,\n- `arr.shift()` -- extracts an item from the beginning,\n- `arr.unshift(...items)` -- adds items to the beginning.\n\nHere are a few others.\n\n### splice\n\nHow to delete an element from the array?\n\nThe arrays are objects, so we can try to use `delete`:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [\"I\", \"go\", \"home\"];\n\ndelete arr[1]; // remove \"go\"\n\nalert( arr[1] ); // undefined\n\n// now arr = [\"I\",  , \"home\"];\nalert( arr.length ); // 3\n```\n\nThe element was removed, but the array still has 3 elements, we can see that `arr.length == 3`.\n\nThat's natural, because `delete obj.key` removes a value by the `key`. It's all it does. Fine for objects. But for arrays we usually want the rest of elements to shift and occupy the freed place. We expect to have a shorter array now.\n\nSo, special methods should be used.\n\nThe [arr.splice(start)](mdn:js/Array/splice) method is a swiss army knife for arrays. It can do everything: insert, remove and replace elements.\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\narr.splice(index[, deleteCount, elem1, ..., elemN])\n```\n\nIt starts from the position `index`: removes `deleteCount` elements and then inserts `elem1, ..., elemN` at their place. Returns the array of removed elements.\n\nThis method is easy to grasp by examples.\n\nLet's start with the deletion:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [\"I\", \"study\", \"JavaScript\"];\n\n*!*\narr.splice(1, 1); // from index 1 remove 1 element\n*/!*\n\nalert( arr ); // [\"I\", \"JavaScript\"]\n```\n\nEasy, right? Starting from the index `1` it removed `1` element.\n\nIn the next example we remove 3 elements and replace them with the other two:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [*!*\"I\", \"study\", \"JavaScript\",*/!* \"right\", \"now\"];\n\n// remove 3 first elements and replace them with another\narr.splice(0, 3, \"Let's\", \"dance\");\n\nalert( arr ) // now [*!*\"Let's\", \"dance\"*/!*, \"right\", \"now\"]\n```\n\nHere we can see that `splice` returns the array of removed elements:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [*!*\"I\", \"study\",*/!* \"JavaScript\", \"right\", \"now\"];\n\n// remove 2 first elements\nlet removed = arr.splice(0, 2);\n\nalert( removed ); // \"I\", \"study\" <-- array of removed elements\n```\n\nThe `splice` method is also able to insert the elements without any removals. For that we need to set `deleteCount` to `0`:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [\"I\", \"study\", \"JavaScript\"];\n\n// from index 2\n// delete 0\n// then insert \"complex\" and \"language\"\narr.splice(2, 0, \"complex\", \"language\");\n\nalert( arr ); // \"I\", \"study\", \"complex\", \"language\", \"JavaScript\"\n```\n\n````smart header=\"Negative indexes allowed\"\nHere and in other array methods, negative indexes are allowed. They specify the position from the end of the array, like here:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [1, 2, 5];\n\n// from index -1 (one step from the end)\n// delete 0 elements,\n// then insert 3 and 4\narr.splice(-1, 0, 3, 4);\n\nalert( arr ); // 1,2,3,4,5\n```\n````\n\n### slice\n\nThe method [arr.slice](mdn:js/Array/slice) is much simpler than similar-looking `arr.splice`.\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\narr.slice([start], [end])\n```\n\nIt returns a new array copying to it all items from index `start` to `end` (not including `end`). Both `start` and `end` can be negative, in that case position from array end is assumed.\n\nIt's similar to a string method `str.slice`, but instead of substrings it makes subarrays.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [\"t\", \"e\", \"s\", \"t\"];\n\nalert( arr.slice(1, 3) ); // e,s (copy from 1 to 3)\n\nalert( arr.slice(-2) ); // s,t (copy from -2 till the end)\n```\n\nWe can also call it without arguments: `arr.slice()` creates a copy of `arr`. That's often used to obtain a copy for further transformations that should not affect the original array.\n\n### concat\n\nThe method [arr.concat](mdn:js/Array/concat) creates a new array that includes values from other arrays and additional items.\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\narr.concat(arg1, arg2...)\n```\n\nIt accepts any number of arguments -- either arrays or values.\n\nThe result is a new array containing items from `arr`, then `arg1`, `arg2` etc.\n\nIf an argument `argN` is an array, then all its elements are copied. Otherwise, the argument itself is copied.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [1, 2];\n\n// create an array from: arr and [3,4]\nalert( arr.concat([3, 4]) ); // 1,2,3,4\n\n// create an array from: arr and [3,4] and [5,6]\nalert( arr.concat([3, 4], [5, 6]) ); // 1,2,3,4,5,6\n\n// create an array from: arr and [3,4], then add values 5 and 6\nalert( arr.concat([3, 4], 5, 6) ); // 1,2,3,4,5,6\n```\n\nNormally, it only copies elements from arrays. Other objects, even if they look like arrays, are added as a whole:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [1, 2];\n\nlet arrayLike = {\n  0: \"something\",\n  length: 1\n};\n\nalert( arr.concat(arrayLike) ); // 1,2,[object Object]\n```\n\n...But if an array-like object has a special `Symbol.isConcatSpreadable` property, then it's treated as an array by `concat`: its elements are added instead:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [1, 2];\n\nlet arrayLike = {\n  0: \"something\",\n  1: \"else\",\n*!*\n  [Symbol.isConcatSpreadable]: true,\n*/!*\n  length: 2\n};\n\nalert( arr.concat(arrayLike) ); // 1,2,something,else\n```\n\n## Iterate: forEach\n\nThe [arr.forEach](mdn:js/Array/forEach) method allows to run a function for every element of the array.\n\nThe syntax:\n```js\narr.forEach(function(item, index, array) {\n  // ... do something with item\n});\n```\n\nFor instance, this shows each element of the array:\n\n```js run\n// for each element call alert\n[\"Bilbo\", \"Gandalf\", \"Nazgul\"].forEach(alert);\n```\n\nAnd this code is more elaborate about their positions in the target array:\n\n```js run\n[\"Bilbo\", \"Gandalf\", \"Nazgul\"].forEach((item, index, array) => {\n  alert(`${item} is at index ${index} in ${array}`);\n});\n```\n\nThe result of the function (if it returns any) is thrown away and ignored.\n\n\n## Searching in array\n\nNow let's cover methods that search in an array.\n\n### indexOf/lastIndexOf and includes\n\nThe methods [arr.indexOf](mdn:js/Array/indexOf), [arr.lastIndexOf](mdn:js/Array/lastIndexOf) and [arr.includes](mdn:js/Array/includes) have the same syntax and do essentially the same as their string counterparts, but operate on items instead of characters:\n\n- `arr.indexOf(item, from)` -- looks for `item` starting from index `from`, and returns the index where it was found, otherwise `-1`.\n- `arr.lastIndexOf(item, from)` -- same, but looks for from right to left.\n- `arr.includes(item, from)` -- looks for `item` starting from index `from`, returns `true` if found.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [1, 0, false];\n\nalert( arr.indexOf(0) ); // 1\nalert( arr.indexOf(false) ); // 2\nalert( arr.indexOf(null) ); // -1\n\nalert( arr.includes(1) ); // true\n```\n\nNote that the methods use `===` comparison. So, if we look for `false`, it finds exactly `false` and not the zero.\n\nIf we want to check for inclusion, and don't want to know the exact index, then `arr.includes` is preferred.\n\nAlso, a very minor difference of `includes` is that it correctly handles `NaN`, unlike `indexOf/lastIndexOf`:\n\n```js run\nconst arr = [NaN];\nalert( arr.indexOf(NaN) ); // -1 (should be 0, but === equality doesn't work for NaN)\nalert( arr.includes(NaN) );// true (correct)\n```\n\n### find and findIndex\n\nImagine we have an array of objects. How do we find an object with the specific condition?\n\nHere the [arr.find(fn)](mdn:js/Array/find) method comes in handy.\n\nThe syntax is:\n```js\nlet result = arr.find(function(item, index, array) {\n  // if true is returned, item is returned and iteration is stopped\n  // for falsy scenario returns undefined\n});\n```\n\nThe function is called for elements of the array, one after another:\n\n- `item` is the element.\n- `index` is its index.\n- `array` is the array itself.\n\nIf it returns `true`, the search is stopped, the `item` is returned. If nothing found, `undefined` is returned.\n\nFor example, we have an array of users, each with the fields `id` and `name`. Let's find the one with `id == 1`:\n\n```js run\nlet users = [\n  {id: 1, name: \"John\"},\n  {id: 2, name: \"Pete\"},\n  {id: 3, name: \"Mary\"}\n];\n\nlet user = users.find(item => item.id == 1);\n\nalert(user.name); // John\n```\n\nIn real life arrays of objects is a common thing, so the `find` method is very useful.\n\nNote that in the example we provide to `find` the function `item => item.id == 1` with one argument. That's typical, other arguments of this function are rarely used.\n\nThe [arr.findIndex](mdn:js/Array/findIndex) method is essentially the same, but it returns the index where the element was found instead of the element itself and `-1` is returned when nothing is found.\n\n### filter\n\nThe `find` method looks for a single (first) element that makes the function return `true`.\n\nIf there may be many, we can use [arr.filter(fn)](mdn:js/Array/filter).\n\nThe syntax is similar to `find`, but `filter` returns an array of all matching elements:\n\n```js\nlet results = arr.filter(function(item, index, array) {\n  // if true item is pushed to results and the iteration continues\n  // returns empty array if nothing found\n});\n```\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet users = [\n  {id: 1, name: \"John\"},\n  {id: 2, name: \"Pete\"},\n  {id: 3, name: \"Mary\"}\n];\n\n// returns array of the first two users\nlet someUsers = users.filter(item => item.id < 3);\n\nalert(someUsers.length); // 2\n```\n\n## Transform an array\n\nLet's move on to methods that transform and reorder an array.\n\n### map\n\nThe [arr.map](mdn:js/Array/map) method is one of the most useful and often used.\n\nIt calls the function for each element of the array and returns the array of results.\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\nlet result = arr.map(function(item, index, array) {\n  // returns the new value instead of item\n});\n```\n\nFor instance, here we transform each element into its length:\n\n```js run\nlet lengths = [\"Bilbo\", \"Gandalf\", \"Nazgul\"].map(item => item.length);\nalert(lengths); // 5,7,6\n```\n\n### sort(fn)\n\nThe call to [arr.sort()](mdn:js/Array/sort) sorts the array *in place*, changing its element order.\n\nIt also returns the sorted array, but the returned value is usually ignored, as `arr` itself is modified.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [ 1, 2, 15 ];\n\n// the method reorders the content of arr\narr.sort();\n\nalert( arr );  // *!*1, 15, 2*/!*\n```\n\nDid you notice anything strange in the outcome?\n\nThe order became `1, 15, 2`. Incorrect. But why?\n\n**The items are sorted as strings by default.**\n\nLiterally, all elements are converted to strings for comparisons. For strings, lexicographic ordering is applied and indeed `\"2\" > \"15\"`.\n\nTo use our own sorting order, we need to supply a function as the argument of `arr.sort()`.\n\nThe function should compare two arbitrary values and return:\n```js\nfunction compare(a, b) {\n  if (a > b) return 1; // if the first value is greater than the second\n  if (a == b) return 0; // if values are equal\n  if (a < b) return -1; // if the first value is less than the second\n}\n```\n\nFor instance, to sort as numbers:\n\n```js run\nfunction compareNumeric(a, b) {\n  if (a > b) return 1;\n  if (a == b) return 0;\n  if (a < b) return -1;\n}\n\nlet arr = [ 1, 2, 15 ];\n\n*!*\narr.sort(compareNumeric);\n*/!*\n\nalert(arr);  // *!*1, 2, 15*/!*\n```\n\nNow it works as intended.\n\nLet's step aside and think what's happening. The `arr` can be array of anything, right? It may contain numbers or strings or objects or whatever. We have a set of *some items*. To sort it, we need an *ordering function* that knows how to compare its elements. The default is a string order.\n\nThe `arr.sort(fn)` method implements a generic sorting algorithm. We don't need to care how it internally works (an optimized [quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) most of the time). It will walk the array, compare its elements using the provided function and reorder them, all we need is to provide the `fn` which does the comparison.\n\nBy the way, if we ever want to know which elements are compared -- nothing prevents from alerting them:\n\n```js run\n[1, -2, 15, 2, 0, 8].sort(function(a, b) {\n  alert( a + \" <> \" + b );\n});\n```\n\nThe algorithm may compare an element with multiple others in the process, but it tries to make as few comparisons as possible.\n\n````smart header=\"A comparison function may return any number\"\nActually, a comparison function is only required to return a positive number to say \"greater\" and a negative number to say \"less\".\n\nThat allows to write shorter functions:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [ 1, 2, 15 ];\n\narr.sort(function(a, b) { return a - b; });\n\nalert(arr);  // *!*1, 2, 15*/!*\n```\n````\n\n````smart header=\"Arrow functions for the best\"\nRemember [arrow functions](info:arrow-functions-basics)? We can use them here for neater sorting:\n\n```js\narr.sort( (a, b) => a - b );\n```\n\nThis works exactly the same as the longer version above.\n````\n\n````smart header=\"Use `localeCompare` for strings\"\nRemember [strings](info:string#correct-comparisons) comparison algorithm? It compares letters by their codes by default.\n\nFor many alphabets, it's better to use `str.localeCompare` method to correctly sort letters, such as `Ö`.\n\nFor example, let's sort a few countries in German:\n\n```js run\nlet countries = ['Österreich', 'Andorra', 'Vietnam'];\n\nalert( countries.sort( (a, b) => a > b ? 1 : -1) ); // Andorra, Vietnam, Österreich (wrong)\n\nalert( countries.sort( (a, b) => a.localeCompare(b) ) ); // Andorra,Österreich,Vietnam (correct!)\n```\n````\n\n### reverse\n\nThe method [arr.reverse](mdn:js/Array/reverse) reverses the order of elements in `arr`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\narr.reverse();\n\nalert( arr ); // 5,4,3,2,1\n```\n\nIt also returns the array `arr` after the reversal.\n\n### split and join\n\nHere's the situation from real life. We are writing a messaging app, and the person enters the comma-delimited list of receivers: `John, Pete, Mary`. But for us an array of names would be much more comfortable than a single string. How to get it?\n\nThe [str.split(delim)](mdn:js/String/split) method does exactly that. It splits the string into an array by the given delimiter `delim`.\n\nIn the example below, we split by a comma followed by space:\n\n```js run\nlet names = 'Bilbo, Gandalf, Nazgul';\n\nlet arr = names.split(', ');\n\nfor (let name of arr) {\n  alert( `A message to ${name}.` ); // A message to Bilbo  (and other names)\n}\n```\n\nThe `split` method has an optional second numeric argument -- a limit on the array length. If it is provided, then the extra elements are ignored. In practice it is rarely used though:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = 'Bilbo, Gandalf, Nazgul, Saruman'.split(', ', 2);\n\nalert(arr); // Bilbo, Gandalf\n```\n\n````smart header=\"Split into letters\"\nThe call to `split(s)` with an empty `s` would split the string into an array of letters:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"test\";\n\nalert( str.split('') ); // t,e,s,t\n```\n````\n\nThe call [arr.join(glue)](mdn:js/Array/join) does the reverse to `split`. It creates a string of `arr` items joined by `glue` between them.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = ['Bilbo', 'Gandalf', 'Nazgul'];\n\nlet str = arr.join(';'); // glue the array into a string using ;\n\nalert( str ); // Bilbo;Gandalf;Nazgul\n```\n\n### reduce/reduceRight\n\nWhen we need to iterate over an array -- we can use `forEach`, `for` or `for..of`.\n\nWhen we need to iterate and return the data for each element -- we can use `map`.\n\nThe methods [arr.reduce](mdn:js/Array/reduce) and [arr.reduceRight](mdn:js/Array/reduceRight) also belong to that breed, but are a little bit more intricate. They are used to calculate a single value based on the array.\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\nlet value = arr.reduce(function(accumulator, item, index, array) {\n  // ...\n}, [initial]);\n```\n\nThe function is applied to all array elements one after another and \"carries on\" its result to the next call.\n\nArguments:\n\n- `accumulator` -- is the result of the previous function call, equals `initial` the first time (if `initial` is provided).\n- `item` -- is the current array item.\n- `index` -- is its position.\n- `array` -- is the array.\n\nAs function is applied, the result of the previous function call is passed to the next one as the first argument.\n\nSo, the first argument is essentially the accumulator that stores the combined result of all previous executions. And at the end it becomes the result of `reduce`.\n\nSounds complicated?\n\nThe easiest way to grasp that is by example.\n\nHere we get a sum of an array in one line:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\nlet result = arr.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current, 0);\n\nalert(result); // 15\n```\n\nThe function passed to `reduce` uses only 2 arguments, that's typically enough.\n\nLet's see the details of what's going on.\n\n1. On the first run, `sum` is the `initial` value (the last argument of `reduce`), equals `0`, and `current` is the first array element, equals `1`. So the function result is `1`.\n2. On the second run, `sum = 1`, we add the second array element (`2`) to it and return.\n3. On the 3rd run, `sum = 3` and we add one more element to it, and so on...\n\nThe calculation flow:\n\n![](reduce.svg)\n\nOr in the form of a table, where each row represents a function call on the next array element:\n\n|   |`sum`|`current`|result|\n|---|-----|---------|---------|\n|the first call|`0`|`1`|`1`|\n|the second call|`1`|`2`|`3`|\n|the third call|`3`|`3`|`6`|\n|the fourth call|`6`|`4`|`10`|\n|the fifth call|`10`|`5`|`15`|\n\nHere we can clearly see how the result of the previous call becomes the first argument of the next one.\n\nWe also can omit the initial value:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n// removed initial value from reduce (no 0)\nlet result = arr.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current);\n\nalert( result ); // 15\n```\n\nThe result is the same. That's because if there's no initial, then `reduce` takes the first element of the array as the initial value and starts the iteration from the 2nd element.\n\nThe calculation table is the same as above, minus the first row.\n\nBut such use requires an extreme care. If the array is empty, then `reduce` call without initial value gives an error.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [];\n\n// Error: Reduce of empty array with no initial value\n// if the initial value existed, reduce would return it for the empty arr.\narr.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current);\n```\n\nSo it's advised to always specify the initial value.\n\nThe method [arr.reduceRight](mdn:js/Array/reduceRight) does the same, but goes from right to left.\n\n\n## Array.isArray\n\nArrays do not form a separate language type. They are based on objects.\n\nSo `typeof` does not help to distinguish a plain object from an array:\n\n```js run\nalert(typeof {}); // object\nalert(typeof []); // same\n```\n\n...But arrays are used so often that there's a special method for that: [Array.isArray(value)](mdn:js/Array/isArray). It returns `true` if the `value` is an array, and `false` otherwise.\n\n```js run\nalert(Array.isArray({})); // false\n\nalert(Array.isArray([])); // true\n```\n\n## Most methods support \"thisArg\"\n\nAlmost all array methods that call functions -- like `find`, `filter`, `map`, with a notable exception of `sort`, accept an optional additional parameter `thisArg`.\n\nThat parameter is not explained in the sections above, because it's rarely used. But for completeness we have to cover it.\n\nHere's the full syntax of these methods:\n\n```js\narr.find(func, thisArg);\narr.filter(func, thisArg);\narr.map(func, thisArg);\n// ...\n// thisArg is the optional last argument\n```\n\nThe value of `thisArg` parameter becomes `this` for `func`.\n\nFor example, here we use a method of `army` object as a filter, and `thisArg` passes the context:\n\n```js run\nlet army = {\n  minAge: 18,\n  maxAge: 27,\n  canJoin(user) {\n    return user.age >= this.minAge && user.age < this.maxAge;\n  }\n};\n\nlet users = [\n  {age: 16},\n  {age: 20},\n  {age: 23},\n  {age: 30}\n];\n\n*!*\n// find users, for who army.canJoin returns true\nlet soldiers = users.filter(army.canJoin, army);\n*/!*\n\nalert(soldiers.length); // 2\nalert(soldiers[0].age); // 20\nalert(soldiers[1].age); // 23\n```\n\nIf in the example above we used `users.filter(army.canJoin)`, then `army.canJoin` would be called as a standalone function, with `this=undefined`, thus leading to an instant error.\n\nA call to `users.filter(army.canJoin, army)` can be replaced with `users.filter(user => army.canJoin(user))`, that does the same. The former is used more often, as it's a bit easier to understand for most people.\n\n## Summary\n\nA cheat sheet of array methods:\n\n- To add/remove elements:\n  - `push(...items)` -- adds items to the end,\n  - `pop()` -- extracts an item from the end,\n  - `shift()` -- extracts an item from the beginning,\n  - `unshift(...items)` -- adds items to the beginning.\n  - `splice(pos, deleteCount, ...items)` -- at index `pos` delete `deleteCount` elements and insert `items`.\n  - `slice(start, end)` -- creates a new array, copies elements from position `start` till `end` (not inclusive) into it.\n  - `concat(...items)` -- returns a new array: copies all members of the current one and adds `items` to it. If any of `items` is an array, then its elements are taken.\n\n- To search among elements:\n  - `indexOf/lastIndexOf(item, pos)` -- look for `item` starting from position `pos`, return the index or `-1` if not found.\n  - `includes(value)` -- returns `true` if the array has `value`, otherwise `false`.\n  - `find/filter(func)` -- filter elements through the function, return first/all values that make it return `true`.\n  - `findIndex` is like `find`, but returns the index instead of a value.\n\n- To iterate over elements:\n  - `forEach(func)` -- calls `func` for every element, does not return anything.\n\n- To transform the array:\n  - `map(func)` -- creates a new array from results of calling `func` for every element.\n  - `sort(func)` -- sorts the array in-place, then returns it.\n  - `reverse()` -- reverses the array in-place, then returns it.\n  - `split/join` -- convert a string to array and back.\n  - `reduce(func, initial)` -- calculate a single value over the array by calling `func` for each element and passing an intermediate result between the calls.\n\n- Additionally:\n  - `Array.isArray(arr)` checks `arr` for being an array.\n\nPlease note that methods `sort`, `reverse` and `splice` modify the array itself.\n\nThese methods are the most used ones, they cover 99% of use cases. But there are few others:\n\n- [arr.some(fn)](mdn:js/Array/some)/[arr.every(fn)](mdn:js/Array/every) checks the array.\n\n  The function `fn` is called on each element of the array similar to `map`. If any/all results are `true`, returns `true`, otherwise `false`.\n\n- [arr.fill(value, start, end)](mdn:js/Array/fill) -- fills the array with repeating `value` from index `start` to `end`.\n\n- [arr.copyWithin(target, start, end)](mdn:js/Array/copyWithin) -- copies its elements from position `start` till position `end` into *itself*, at position `target` (overwrites existing).\n\nFor the full list, see the [manual](mdn:js/Array).\n\nFrom the first sight it may seem that there are so many methods, quite difficult to remember. But actually that's much easier.\n\nLook through the cheat sheet just to be aware of them. Then solve the tasks of this chapter to practice, so that you have experience with array methods.\n\nAfterwards whenever you need to do something with an array, and you don't know how -- come here, look at the cheat sheet and find the right method. Examples will help you to write it correctly. Soon you'll automatically remember the methods, without specific efforts from your side.",

It runs `shuffle` 1000000 times and counts appearances of all possible results:\n\n```js run\nfunction shuffle(array) {\n  array.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);\n}\n\n// counts of appearances for all possible permutations\nlet count = {\n  '123': 0,\n  '132': 0,\n  '213': 0,\n  '231': 0,\n  '321': 0,\n  '312': 0\n};\n\nfor (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {\n  let array = [1, 2, 3];\n  shuffle(array);\n  count[array.join('')]++;\n}\n\n// show counts of all possible permutations\nfor (let key in count) {\n  alert(`${key}: ${count[key]}`);\n}\n```\n\nAn example result (depends on JS engine):\n\n```js\n123: 250706\n132: 124425\n213: 249618\n231: 124880\n312: 125148\n321: 125223\n```\n\nWe can see the bias clearly: `123` and `213` appear much more often than others.\n\nThe result of the code may vary between JavaScript engines, but we can already see that the approach is unreliable.\n\nWhy it doesn't work? Generally speaking, `sort` is a \"black box\": we throw an array and a comparison function into it and expect the array to be sorted. But due to the utter randomness of the comparison the black box goes mad, and how exactly it goes mad depends on the concrete implementation that differs between engines.\n\nThere are other good ways to do the task. For instance, there's a great algorithm called [Fisher-Yates shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle).

        "content": "\n\n*Iterable* objects is a generalization of arrays. That's a concept that allows us to make any object useable in a `for..of` loop.\n\nOf course, Arrays are iterable. But there are many other built-in objects, that are iterable as well. For instance, strings are also iterable.\n\nIf an object isn't technically an array, but represents a collection (list, set) of something, then `for..of` is a great syntax to loop over it, so let's see how to make it work.\n\n\n## Symbol.iterator\n\nWe can easily grasp the concept of iterables by making one of our own.\n\nFor instance, we have an object that is not an array, but looks suitable for `for..of`.\n\nLike a `range` object that represents an interval of numbers:\n\n```js\nlet range = {\n  from: 1,\n  to: 5\n};\n\n// We want the for..of to work:\n// for(let num of range) ... num=1,2,3,4,5\n```\n\nTo make the `range` iterable (and thus let `for..of` work) we need to add a method to the object named `Symbol.iterator` (a special built-in symbol just for that).\n\n1. When `for..of` starts, it calls that method once (or errors if not found). The method must return an *iterator* -- an object with the method `next`.\n2. Onward, `for..of` works *only with that returned object*.\n3. When `for..of` wants the next value, it calls `next()` on that object.\n4. The result of `next()` must have the form `{done: Boolean, value: any}`, where `done=true`  means that the iteration is finished, otherwise `value` is the next value.\n\nHere's the full implementation for `range` with remarks:\n\n```js run\nlet range = {\n  from: 1,\n  to: 5\n};\n\n// 1. call to for..of initially calls this\nrange[Symbol.iterator] = function() {\n\n  // ...it returns the iterator object:\n  // 2. Onward, for..of works only with this iterator, asking it for next values\n  return {\n    current: this.from,\n    last: this.to,      \n\n    // 3. next() is called on each iteration by the for..of loop\n    next() {\n      // 4. it should return the value as an object {done:.., value :...}\n      if (this.current <= this.last) {\n        return { done: false, value: this.current++ };\n      } else {\n        return { done: true };\n      }\n    }\n  };\n};\n\n// now it works!\nfor (let num of range) {\n  alert(num); // 1, then 2, 3, 4, 5\n}\n```\n\nPlease note the core feature of iterables: separation of concerns.\n\n- The `range` itself does not have the `next()` method.\n- Instead, another object, a so-called \"iterator\" is created by the call to `range[Symbol.iterator]()`, and its `next()` generates values for the iteration.\n\nSo, the iterator object is separate from the object it iterates over.\n\nTechnically, we may merge them and use `range` itself as the iterator to make the code simpler.\n\nLike this:\n\n```js run\nlet range = {\n  from: 1,\n  to: 5,\n\n  [Symbol.iterator]() {\n    this.current = this.from;\n    return this;\n  },\n\n  next() {\n    if (this.current <= this.to) {\n      return { done: false, value: this.current++ };\n    } else {\n      return { done: true };\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nfor (let num of range) {\n  alert(num); // 1, then 2, 3, 4, 5\n}\n```\n\nNow `range[Symbol.iterator]()` returns the `range` object itself:  it has the necessary `next()` method and remembers the current iteration progress in `this.current`. Shorter? Yes. And sometimes that's fine too.\n\nThe downside is that now it's impossible to have two `for..of` loops running over the object simultaneously: they'll share the iteration state, because there's only one iterator -- the object itself. But two parallel for-ofs is a rare thing, even in async scenarios.\n\n```smart header=\"Infinite iterators\"\nInfinite iterators are also possible. For instance, the `range` becomes infinite for `range.to = Infinity`. Or we can make an iterable object that generates an infinite sequence of pseudorandom numbers. Also can be useful.\n\nThere are no limitations on `next`, it can return more and more values, that's normal.\n\nOf course, the `for..of` loop over such an iterable would be endless. But we can always stop it using `break`.\n```\n\n\n## String is iterable\n\nArrays and strings are most widely used built-in iterables.\n\nFor a string, `for..of` loops over its characters:\n\n```js run\nfor (let char of \"test\") {\n  // triggers 4 times: once for each character\n  alert( char ); // t, then e, then s, then t\n}\n```\n\nAnd it works correctly with surrogate pairs!\n\n```js run\nlet str = '𝒳😂';\nfor (let char of str) {\n    alert( char ); // 𝒳, and then 😂\n}\n```\n\n## Calling an iterator explicitly\n\nFor deeper understanding let's see how to use an iterator explicitly.\n\nWe'll iterate over a string in exactly the same way as `for..of`, but with direct calls. This code creates a string iterator and gets values from it \"manually\":\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"Hello\";\n\n// does the same as\n// for (let char of str) alert(char);\n\n*!*\nlet iterator = str[Symbol.iterator]();\n*/!*\n\nwhile (true) {\n  let result = iterator.next();\n  if (result.done) break;\n  alert(result.value); // outputs characters one by one\n}\n```\n\nThat is rarely needed, but gives us more control over the process than `for..of`. For instance, we can split the iteration process: iterate a bit, then stop, do something else, and then resume later.\n\n## Iterables and array-likes [#array-like]\n\nThere are two official terms that look similar, but are very different. Please make sure you understand them well to avoid the confusion.\n\n- *Iterables* are objects that implement the `Symbol.iterator` method, as described above.\n- *Array-likes* are objects that have indexes and `length`, so they look like arrays.\n\nWhen we use JavaScript for practical tasks in browser or other environments, we may meet objects that are iterables or array-likes, or both.\n\nFor instance, strings are both iterable (`for..of` works on them) and array-like (they have numeric indexes and `length`).\n\nBut an iterable may be not array-like. And vice versa an array-like may be not iterable.\n\nFor example, the `range` in the example above is iterable, but not array-like, because it does not have indexed properties and `length`.\n\nAnd here's the object that is array-like, but not iterable:\n\n```js run\nlet arrayLike = { // has indexes and length => array-like\n  0: \"Hello\",\n  1: \"World\",\n  length: 2\n};\n\n*!*\n// Error (no Symbol.iterator)\nfor (let item of arrayLike) {}\n*/!*\n```\n\nBoth iterables and array-likes are usually *not arrays*, they don't have `push`, `pop` etc. That's rather inconvenient if we have such an object and want to work with it as with an array. E.g. we would like to work with `range` using array methods. How to achieve that?\n\n## Array.from\n\nThere's a universal method [Array.from](mdn:js/Array/from) that takes an iterable or array-like value and makes a \"real\" `Array` from it. Then we can call array methods on it.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet arrayLike = {\n  0: \"Hello\",\n  1: \"World\",\n  length: 2\n};\n\n*!*\nlet arr = Array.from(arrayLike); // (*)\n*/!*\nalert(arr.pop()); // World (method works)\n```\n\n`Array.from` at the line `(*)` takes the object, examines it for being an iterable or array-like, then makes a new array and copies all items to it.\n\nThe same happens for an iterable:\n\n```js\n// assuming that range is taken from the example above\nlet arr = Array.from(range);\nalert(arr); // 1,2,3,4,5 (array toString conversion works)\n```\n\nThe full syntax for `Array.from` also allows us to provide an optional \"mapping\" function:\n```js\nArray.from(obj[, mapFn, thisArg])\n```\n\nThe optional second argument `mapFn` can be a function that will be applied to each element before adding it to the array, and `thisArg` allows us to set `this` for it.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js\n// assuming that range is taken from the example above\n\n// square each number\nlet arr = Array.from(range, num => num * num);\n\nalert(arr); // 1,4,9,16,25\n```\n\nHere we use `Array.from` to turn a string into an array of characters:\n\n```js run\nlet str = '𝒳😂';\n\n// splits str into array of characters\nlet chars = Array.from(str);\n\nalert(chars[0]); // 𝒳\nalert(chars[1]); // 😂\nalert(chars.length); // 2\n```\n\nUnlike `str.split`, it relies on the iterable nature of the string and so, just like `for..of`, correctly works with surrogate pairs.\n\nTechnically here it does the same as:\n\n```js run\nlet str = '𝒳😂';\n\nlet chars = []; // Array.from internally does the same loop\nfor (let char of str) {\n  chars.push(char);\n}\n\nalert(chars);\n```\n\n...But it is shorter.    \n\nWe can even build surrogate-aware `slice` on it:\n\n```js run\nfunction slice(str, start, end) {\n  return Array.from(str).slice(start, end).join('');\n}\n\nlet str = '𝒳😂𩷶';\n\nalert( slice(str, 1, 3) ); // 😂𩷶\n\n// the native method does not support surrogate pairs\nalert( str.slice(1, 3) ); // garbage (two pieces from different surrogate pairs)\n```\n\n\n## Summary\n\nObjects that can be used in `for..of` are called *iterable*.\n\n- Technically, iterables must implement the method named `Symbol.iterator`.\n    - The result of `obj[Symbol.iterator]` is called an *iterator*. It handles the further iteration process.\n    - An iterator must have the method named `next()` that returns an object `{done: Boolean, value: any}`, here `done:true` denotes the end of the iteration process, otherwise the `value` is the next value.\n- The `Symbol.iterator` method is called automatically by `for..of`, but we also can do it directly.\n- Built-in iterables like strings or arrays, also implement `Symbol.iterator`.\n- String iterator knows about surrogate pairs.\n\n\nObjects that have indexed properties and `length` are called *array-like*. Such objects may also have other properties and methods, but lack the built-in methods of arrays.\n\nIf we look inside the specification -- we'll see that most built-in methods assume that they work with iterables or array-likes instead of \"real\" arrays, because that's more abstract.\n\n`Array.from(obj[, mapFn, thisArg])` makes a real `Array` of an iterable or array-like `obj`, and we can then use array methods on it. The optional arguments `mapFn` and `thisArg` allow us to apply a function to each item.",

But the main difference is that `Map` allows keys of any type.\n\nMethods and properties are:\n\n- `new Map()` -- creates the map.\n- `map.set(key, value)` -- stores the value by the key.\n- `map.get(key)` -- returns the value by the key, `undefined` if `key` doesn't exist in map.\n- `map.has(key)` -- returns `true` if the `key` exists, `false` otherwise.\n- `map.delete(key)` -- removes the value by the key.\n- `map.clear()` -- removes everything from the map.\n- `map.size` -- returns the current element count.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet map = new Map();\n\nmap.set('1', 'str1');   // a string key\nmap.set(1, 'num1');     // a numeric key\nmap.set(true, 'bool1'); // a boolean key\n\n// remember the regular Object? it would convert keys to string\n// Map keeps the type, so these two are different:\nalert( map.get(1)   ); // 'num1'\nalert( map.get('1') ); // 'str1'\n\nalert( map.size ); // 3\n```\n\nAs we can see, unlike objects, keys are not converted to strings. Any type of key is possible.\n\n```smart header=\"`map[key]` isn't the right way to use a `Map`\"\nAlthough `map[key]` also works, e.g. we can set `map[key] = 2`, this is treating `map` as a plain JavaScript object, so it implies all corresponding limitations (no object keys and so on).\n\nSo we should use `map` methods: `set`, `get` and so on.\n```\n\n**Map can also use objects as keys.**\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet john = { name: \"John\" };\n\n// for every user, let's store their visits count\nlet visitsCountMap = new Map();\n\n// john is the key for the map\nvisitsCountMap.set(john, 123);\n\nalert( visitsCountMap.get(john) ); // 123\n```\n\nUsing objects as keys is one of most notable and important `Map` features. For string keys, `Object` can be fine, but not for object keys.\n\nLet's try:\n\n```js run\nlet john = { name: \"John\" };\n\nlet visitsCountObj = {}; // try to use an object\n\nvisitsCountObj[john] = 123; // try to use john object as the key\n\n*!*\n// That's what got written!\nalert( visitsCountObj[\"[object Object]\"] ); // 123\n*/!*\n```\n\nAs `visitsCountObj` is an object, it converts all keys, such as `john` to strings, so we've got the string key `\"[object Object]\"`. Definitely not what we want.\n\n```smart header=\"How `Map` compares keys\"\nTo test keys for equivalence, `Map` uses the algorithm [SameValueZero](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-samevaluezero). It is roughly the same as strict equality `===`, but the difference is that `NaN` is considered equal to `NaN`. So `NaN` can be used as the key as well.\n\nThis algorithm can't be changed or customized.\n```\n\n````smart header=\"Chaining\"\nEvery `map.set` call returns the map itself, so we can \"chain\" the calls:\n\n```js\nmap.set('1', 'str1')\n  .set(1, 'num1')\n  .set(true, 'bool1');\n```\n````\n\n\n## Iteration over Map\n\nFor looping over a `map`, there are 3 methods:\n\n- `map.keys()` -- returns an iterable for keys,\n- `map.values()` -- returns an iterable for values,\n- `map.entries()` -- returns an iterable for entries `[key, value]`, it's used by default in `for..of`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet recipeMap = new Map([\n  ['cucumber', 500],\n  ['tomatoes', 350],\n  ['onion',    50]\n]);\n\n// iterate over keys (vegetables)\nfor (let vegetable of recipeMap.keys()) {\n  alert(vegetable); // cucumber, tomatoes, onion\n}\n\n// iterate over values (amounts)\nfor (let amount of recipeMap.values()) {\n  alert(amount); // 500, 350, 50\n}\n\n// iterate over [key, value] entries\nfor (let entry of recipeMap) { // the same as of recipeMap.entries()\n  alert(entry); // cucumber,500 (and so on)\n}\n```\n\n```smart header=\"The insertion order is used\"\nThe iteration goes in the same order as the values were inserted. `Map` preserves this order, unlike a regular `Object`.\n```\n\nBesides that, `Map` has a built-in `forEach` method, similar to `Array`:\n\n```js\n// runs the function for each (key, value) pair\nrecipeMap.forEach( (value, key, map) => {\n  alert(`${key}: ${value}`); // cucumber: 500 etc\n});\n```\n\n## Object.entries: Map from Object\n\nWhen a `Map` is created, we can pass an array (or another iterable) with key/value pairs for initialization, like this:\n\n```js run\n// array of [key, value] pairs\nlet map = new Map([\n  ['1',  'str1'],\n  [1,    'num1'],\n  [true, 'bool1']\n]);\n\nalert( map.get('1') ); // str1\n```\n\nIf we have a plain object, and we'd like to create a `Map` from it, then we can use built-in method [Object.entries(obj)](mdn:js/Object/entries) that returns an array of key/value pairs for an object exactly in that format.\n\nSo we can create a map from an object like this:\n\n```js run\nlet obj = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30\n};\n\n*!*\nlet map = new Map(Object.entries(obj));\n*/!*\n\nalert( map.get('name') ); // John\n```\n\nHere, `Object.entries` returns the array of key/value pairs: `[ [\"name\",\"John\"], [\"age\", 30] ]`. That's what `Map` needs.\n\n\n## Object.fromEntries: Object from Map\n\nWe've just seen how to create `Map` from a plain object with `Object.entries(obj)`.\n\nThere's `Object.fromEntries` method that does the reverse: given an array of `[key, value]` pairs, it creates an object from them:\n\n```js run\nlet prices = Object.fromEntries([\n  ['banana', 1],\n  ['orange', 2],\n  ['meat', 4]\n]);\n\n// now prices = { banana: 1, orange: 2, meat: 4 }\n\nalert(prices.orange); // 2\n```\n\nWe can use `Object.fromEntries` to get a plain object from `Map`.\n\nE.g. we store the data in a `Map`, but we need to pass it to a 3rd-party code that expects a plain object.\n\nHere we go:\n\n```js run\nlet map = new Map();\nmap.set('banana', 1);\nmap.set('orange', 2);\nmap.set('meat', 4);\n\n*!*\nlet obj = Object.fromEntries(map.entries()); // make a plain object (*)\n*/!*\n\n// done!\n// obj = { banana: 1, orange: 2, meat: 4 }\n\nalert(obj.orange); // 2\n```\n\nA call to `map.entries()` returns an iterable of key/value pairs, exactly in the right format for `Object.fromEntries`.\n\nWe could also make line `(*)` shorter:\n```js\nlet obj = Object.fromEntries(map); // omit .entries()\n```\n\nThat's the same, because `Object.fromEntries` expects an iterable object as the argument. Not necessarily an array. And the standard iteration for `map` returns same key/value pairs as `map.entries()`. So we get a plain object with same key/values as the `map`.\n\n## Set\n\nA `Set` is a special type collection - \"set of values\" (without keys), where each value may occur only once.\n\nIts main methods are:\n\n- `new Set(iterable)` -- creates the set, and if an `iterable` object is provided (usually an array), copies values from it into the set.\n- `set.add(value)` -- adds a value, returns the set itself.\n- `set.delete(value)` -- removes the value, returns `true` if `value` existed at the moment of the call, otherwise `false`.\n- `set.has(value)` -- returns `true` if the value exists in the set, otherwise `false`.\n- `set.clear()` -- removes everything from the set.\n- `set.size` -- is the elements count.\n\nThe main feature is that repeated calls of `set.add(value)` with the same value don't do anything. That's the reason why each value appears in a `Set` only once.\n\nFor example, we have visitors coming, and we'd like to remember everyone. But repeated visits should not lead to duplicates. A visitor must be \"counted\" only once.\n\n`Set` is just the right thing for that:\n\n```js run\nlet set = new Set();\n\nlet john = { name: \"John\" };\nlet pete = { name: \"Pete\" };\nlet mary = { name: \"Mary\" };\n\n// visits, some users come multiple times\nset.add(john);\nset.add(pete);\nset.add(mary);\nset.add(john);\nset.add(mary);\n\n// set keeps only unique values\nalert( set.size ); // 3\n\nfor (let user of set) {\n  alert(user.name); // John (then Pete and Mary)\n}\n```\n\nThe alternative to `Set` could be an array of users, and the code to check for duplicates on every insertion using [arr.find](mdn:js/Array/find). But the performance would be much worse, because this method walks through the whole array checking every element. `Set` is much better optimized internally for uniqueness checks.\n\n## Iteration over Set\n\nWe can loop over a set either with `for..of` or using `forEach`:\n\n```js run\nlet set = new Set([\"oranges\", \"apples\", \"bananas\"]);\n\nfor (let value of set) alert(value);\n\n// the same with forEach:\nset.forEach((value, valueAgain, set) => {\n  alert(value);\n});\n```\n\nNote the funny thing. The callback function passed in `forEach` has 3 arguments: a `value`, then *the same value* `valueAgain`, and then the target object. Indeed, the same value appears in the arguments twice.\n\nThat's for compatibility with `Map` where the callback passed `forEach` has three arguments. Looks a bit strange, for sure. But may help to replace `Map` with `Set` in certain cases with ease, and vice versa.\n\nThe same methods `Map` has for iterators are also supported:\n\n- `set.keys()` -- returns an iterable object for values,\n- `set.values()` -- same as `set.keys()`, for compatibility with `Map`,\n- `set.entries()` -- returns an iterable object for entries `[value, value]`, exists for compatibility with `Map`.\n\n## Summary\n\n`Map` -- is a collection of keyed values.\n\nMethods and properties:\n\n- `new Map([iterable])` -- creates the map, with optional `iterable` (e.g. array) of `[key,value]` pairs for initialization.\n- `map.set(key, value)` -- stores the value by the key.\n- `map.get(key)` -- returns the value by the key, `undefined` if `key` doesn't exist in map.\n- `map.has(key)` -- returns `true` if the `key` exists, `false` otherwise.\n- `map.delete(key)` -- removes the value by the key.\n- `map.clear()` -- removes everything from the map.\n- `map.size` -- returns the current element count.\n\nThe differences from a regular `Object`:\n\n- Any keys, objects can be keys.\n- Additional convenient methods, the `size` property.\n\n`Set` -- is a collection of unique values.\n\nMethods and properties:\n\n- `new Set([iterable])` -- creates the set, with optional `iterable` (e.g. array) of values for initialization.\n- `set.add(value)` -- adds a value (does nothing if `value` exists), returns the set itself.\n- `set.delete(value)` -- removes the value, returns `true` if `value` existed at the moment of the call, otherwise `false`.\n- `set.has(value)` -- returns `true` if the value exists in the set, otherwise `false`.\n- `set.clear()` -- removes everything from the set.\n- `set.size` -- is the elements count.\n\nIteration over `Map` and `Set` is always in the insertion order, so we can't say that these collections are unordered, but we can't reorder elements or directly get an element by its number.",

        "content": "\n\nAs we know from the chapter <info:garbage-collection>, JavaScript engine stores a value in memory while it is reachable (and can potentially be used).\n\nFor instance:\n```js\nlet john = { name: \"John\" };\n\n// the object can be accessed, john is the reference to it\n\n// overwrite the reference\njohn = null;\n\n*!*\n// the object will be removed from memory\n*/!*\n```\n\nUsually, properties of an object or elements of an array or another data structure are considered reachable and kept in memory while that data structure is in memory.\n\nFor instance, if we put an object into an array, then while the array is alive, the object will be alive as well, even if there are no other references to it.\n\nLike this:\n\n```js\nlet john = { name: \"John\" };\n\nlet array = [ john ];\n\njohn = null; // overwrite the reference\n\n*!*\n// john is stored inside the array, so it won't be garbage-collected\n// we can get it as array[0]\n*/!*\n```\n\nSimilar to that, if we use an object as the key in a regular `Map`, then while the `Map` exists, that object exists as well. It occupies memory and may not be garbage collected.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js\nlet john = { name: \"John\" };\n\nlet map = new Map();\nmap.set(john, \"...\");\n\njohn = null; // overwrite the reference\n\n*!*\n// john is stored inside the map,\n// we can get it by using map.keys()\n*/!*\n```\n\n`WeakMap` is fundamentally different in this aspect. It doesn't prevent garbage-collection of key objects.\n\nLet's see what it means on examples.\n\n## WeakMap\n\nThe first difference from `Map` is that `WeakMap` keys must be objects, not primitive values:\n\n```js run\nlet weakMap = new WeakMap();\n\nlet obj = {};\n\nweakMap.set(obj, \"ok\"); // works fine (object key)\n\n*!*\n// can't use a string as the key\nweakMap.set(\"test\", \"Whoops\"); // Error, because \"test\" is not an object\n*/!*\n```\n\nNow, if we use an object as the key in it, and there are no other references to that object -- it will be removed from memory (and from the map) automatically.\n\n```js\nlet john = { name: \"John\" };\n\nlet weakMap = new WeakMap();\nweakMap.set(john, \"...\");\n\njohn = null; // overwrite the reference\n\n// john is removed from memory!\n```\n\nCompare it with the regular `Map` example above. Now if `john` only exists as the key of `WeakMap` -- it will be automatically deleted from the map (and memory).\n\n`WeakMap` does not support iteration and methods `keys()`, `values()`, `entries()`, so there's no way to get all keys or values from it.\n\n`WeakMap` has only the following methods:\n\n- `weakMap.get(key)`\n- `weakMap.set(key, value)`\n- `weakMap.delete(key)`\n- `weakMap.has(key)`\n\nWhy such a limitation? That's for technical reasons. If an object has lost all other references (like `john` in the code above), then it is to be garbage-collected automatically. But technically it's not exactly specified *when the cleanup happens*.\n\nThe JavaScript engine decides that. It may choose to perform the memory cleanup immediately or to wait and do the cleaning later when more deletions happen. So, technically the current element count of a `WeakMap` is not known. The engine may have cleaned it up or not, or did it partially. For that reason, methods that access all keys/values are not supported.\n\nNow where do we need such data structure?\n\n## Use case: additional data\n\nThe main area of application for `WeakMap` is an *additional data storage*.\n\nIf we're working with an object that \"belongs\" to another code, maybe even a third-party library, and would like to store some data associated with it, that should only exist while the object is alive - then `WeakMap` is exactly what's needed.\n\nWe put the data to a `WeakMap`, using the object as the key, and when the object is garbage collected, that data will automatically disappear as well.\n\n```js\nweakMap.set(john, \"secret documents\");\n// if john dies, secret documents will be destroyed automatically\n```\n\nLet's look at an example.\n\nFor instance, we have code that keeps a visit count for users. The information is stored in a map: a user object is the key and the visit count is the value. When a user leaves (its object gets garbage collected), we don't want to store their visit count anymore.\n\nHere's an example of a counting function with `Map`:\n\n```js\n// 📁 visitsCount.js\nlet visitsCountMap = new Map(); // map: user => visits count\n\n// increase the visits count\nfunction countUser(user) {\n  let count = visitsCountMap.get(user) || 0;\n  visitsCountMap.set(user, count + 1);\n}\n```\n\nAnd here's another part of the code, maybe another file using it:\n\n```js\n// 📁 main.js\nlet john = { name: \"John\" };\n\ncountUser(john); // count his visits\n\n// later john leaves us\njohn = null;\n```\n\nNow `john` object should be garbage collected, but remains in memory, as it's a key in `visitsCountMap`.\n\nWe need to clean `visitsCountMap` when we remove users, otherwise it will grow in memory indefinitely. Such cleaning can become a tedious task in complex architectures.\n\nWe can avoid it by switching to `WeakMap` instead:\n\n```js\n// 📁 visitsCount.js\nlet visitsCountMap = new WeakMap(); // weakmap: user => visits count\n\n// increase the visits count\nfunction countUser(user) {\n  let count = visitsCountMap.get(user) || 0;\n  visitsCountMap.set(user, count + 1);\n}\n```\n\nNow we don't have to clean `visitsCountMap`. After `john` object becomes unreachable by all means except as a key of `WeakMap`, it gets removed from memory, along with the information by that key from `WeakMap`.\n\n## Use case: caching\n\nAnother common example is caching: when a function result should be remembered (\"cached\"), so that future calls on the same object reuse it.\n\nWe can use `Map` to store results, like this:\n\n```js run\n// 📁 cache.js\nlet cache = new Map();\n\n// calculate and remember the result\nfunction process(obj) {\n  if (!cache.has(obj)) {\n    let result = /* calculations of the result for */ obj;\n\n    cache.set(obj, result);\n  }\n\n  return cache.get(obj);\n}\n\n*!*\n// Now we use process() in another file:\n*/!*\n\n// 📁 main.js\nlet obj = {/* let's say we have an object */};\n\nlet result1 = process(obj); // calculated\n\n// ...later, from another place of the code...\nlet result2 = process(obj); // remembered result taken from cache\n\n// ...later, when the object is not needed any more:\nobj = null;\n\nalert(cache.size); // 1 (Ouch! The object is still in cache, taking memory!)\n```\n\nFor multiple calls of `process(obj)` with the same object, it only calculates the result the first time, and then just takes it from `cache`. The downside is that we need to clean `cache` when the object is not needed any more.\n\nIf we replace `Map` with `WeakMap`, then this problem disappears: the cached result will be removed from memory automatically after the object gets garbage collected.\n\n```js run\n// 📁 cache.js\n*!*\nlet cache = new WeakMap();\n*/!*\n\n// calculate and remember the result\nfunction process(obj) {\n  if (!cache.has(obj)) {\n    let result = /* calculate the result for */ obj;\n\n    cache.set(obj, result);\n  }\n\n  return cache.get(obj);\n}\n\n// 📁 main.js\nlet obj = {/* some object */};\n\nlet result1 = process(obj);\nlet result2 = process(obj);\n\n// ...later, when the object is not needed any more:\nobj = null;\n\n// Can't get cache.size, as it's a WeakMap,\n// but it's 0 or soon be 0\n// When obj gets garbage collected, cached data will be removed as well\n```\n\n## WeakSet\n\n`WeakSet` behaves similarly:\n\n- It is analogous to `Set`, but we may only add objects to `WeakSet` (not primitives).\n- An object exists in the set while it is reachable from somewhere else.\n- Like `Set`, it supports `add`, `has` and `delete`, but not `size`, `keys()` and no iterations.\n\nBeing \"weak\", it also serves as an additional storage. But not for an arbitrary data, but rather for \"yes/no\" facts. A membership in `WeakSet` may mean something about the object.\n\nFor instance, we can add users to `WeakSet` to keep track of those who visited our site:\n\n```js run\nlet visitedSet = new WeakSet();\n\nlet john = { name: \"John\" };\nlet pete = { name: \"Pete\" };\nlet mary = { name: \"Mary\" };\n\nvisitedSet.add(john); // John visited us\nvisitedSet.add(pete); // Then Pete\nvisitedSet.add(john); // John again\n\n// visitedSet has 2 users now\n\n// check if John visited?\nalert(visitedSet.has(john)); // true\n\n// check if Mary visited?\nalert(visitedSet.has(mary)); // false\n\njohn = null;\n\n// visitedSet will be cleaned automatically\n```\n\nThe most notable limitation of `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` is the absence of iterations, and inability to get all current content. That may appear inconvenient, but does not prevent `WeakMap/WeakSet` from doing their main job -- be an \"additional\" storage of data for objects which are stored/managed at another place.\n\n## Summary\n\n`WeakMap` is `Map`-like collection that allows only objects as keys and removes them together with associated value once they become inaccessible by other means.\n\n`WeakSet` is `Set`-like collection that stores only objects and removes them once they become inaccessible by other means.\n\nBoth of them do not support methods and properties that refer to all keys or their count. Only individual operations are allowed.\n\n`WeakMap` and `WeakSet` are used as \"secondary\" data structures in addition to the \"main\" object storage. Once the object is removed from the main storage, if it is only found as the key of `WeakMap` or in a `WeakSet`, it will be cleaned up automatically.",

        "content": "\n\nLet's step away from the individual data structures and talk about the iterations over them.\n\nIn the previous chapter we saw methods `map.keys()`, `map.values()`, `map.entries()`.\n\nThese methods are generic, there is a common agreement to use them for data structures. If we ever create a data structure of our own, we should implement them too.\n\nThey are supported for:\n\n- `Map`\n- `Set`\n- `Array`\n\nPlain objects also support similar methods, but the syntax is a bit different.\n\n## Object.keys, values, entries\n\nFor plain objects, the following methods are available:\n\n- [Object.keys(obj)](mdn:js/Object/keys) -- returns an array of keys.\n- [Object.values(obj)](mdn:js/Object/values) -- returns an array of values.\n- [Object.entries(obj)](mdn:js/Object/entries) -- returns an array of `[key, value]` pairs.\n\nPlease note the distinctions (compared to map for example):\n\n|             | Map              | Object       |\n|-------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Call syntax | `map.keys()`  | `Object.keys(obj)`, but not `obj.keys()` |\n| Returns     | iterable    | \"real\" Array                     |\n\nThe first difference is that we have to call `Object.keys(obj)`, and not `obj.keys()`.\n\nWhy so? The main reason is flexibility. Remember, objects are a base of all complex structures in JavaScript. So we may have an object of our own like `data` that implements its own `data.values()` method. And we still can call `Object.values(data)` on it.\n\nThe second difference is that `Object.*` methods return \"real\" array objects, not just an iterable. That's mainly for historical reasons.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30\n};\n```\n\n- `Object.keys(user) = [\"name\", \"age\"]`\n- `Object.values(user) = [\"John\", 30]`\n- `Object.entries(user) = [ [\"name\",\"John\"], [\"age\",30] ]`\n\nHere's an example of using `Object.values` to loop over property values:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30\n};\n\n// loop over values\nfor (let value of Object.values(user)) {\n  alert(value); // John, then 30\n}\n```\n\n```warn header=\"Object.keys/values/entries ignore symbolic properties\"\nJust like a `for..in` loop, these methods ignore properties that use `Symbol(...)` as keys.\n\nUsually that's convenient. But if we want symbolic keys too, then there's a separate method [Object.getOwnPropertySymbols](mdn:js/Object/getOwnPropertySymbols) that returns an array of only symbolic keys. Also, there exist a method [Reflect.ownKeys(obj)](mdn:js/Reflect/ownKeys) that returns *all* keys.\n```\n\n\n## Transforming objects\n\nObjects lack many methods that exist for arrays, e.g. `map`, `filter` and others.\n\nIf we'd like to apply them, then we can use `Object.entries` followed `Object.fromEntries`:\n\n1. Use `Object.entries(obj)` to get an array of key/value pairs from `obj`.\n2. Use array methods on that array, e.g. `map`.\n3. Use `Object.fromEntries(array)` on the resulting array to turn it back into an object.\n\nFor example, we have an object with prices, and would like to double them:\n\n```js run\nlet prices = {\n  banana: 1,\n  orange: 2,\n  meat: 4,\n};\n\n*!*\nlet doublePrices = Object.fromEntries(\n  // convert to array, map, and then fromEntries gives back the object\n  Object.entries(prices).map(([key, value]) => [key, value * 2])\n);\n*/!*\n\nalert(doublePrices.meat); // 8\n```   \n\nIt may look difficult from the first sight, but becomes easy to understand after you use it once or twice. We can make powerful chains of transforms this way.",

Destructuring also works great with complex functions that have a lot of parameters, default values, and so on.\n\n## Array destructuring\n\nAn example of how the array is destructured into variables:\n\n```js\n// we have an array with the name and surname\nlet arr = [\"Ilya\", \"Kantor\"]\n\n*!*\n// destructuring assignment\n// sets firstName = arr[0]\n// and surname = arr[1]\nlet [firstName, surname] = arr;\n*/!*\n\nalert(firstName); // Ilya\nalert(surname);  // Kantor\n```\n\nNow we can work with variables instead of array members.\n\nIt looks great when combined with `split` or other array-returning methods:\n\n```js\nlet [firstName, surname] = \"Ilya Kantor\".split(' ');\n```\n\n````smart header=\"\\\"Destructuring\\\" does not mean \\\"destructive\\\".\"\nIt's called \"destructuring assignment,\" because it \"destructurizes\" by copying items into variables. But the array itself is not modified.\n\nIt's just a shorter way to write:\n```js\n// let [firstName, surname] = arr;\nlet firstName = arr[0];\nlet surname = arr[1];\n```\n````\n\n````smart header=\"Ignore elements using commas\"\nUnwanted elements of the array can also be thrown away via an extra comma:\n\n```js run\n*!*\n// second element is not needed\nlet [firstName, , title] = [\"Julius\", \"Caesar\", \"Consul\", \"of the Roman Republic\"];\n*/!*\n\nalert( title ); // Consul\n```\n\nIn the code above, the second element of the array is skipped, the third one is assigned to `title`, and the rest of the array items is also skipped (as there are no variables for them).\n````\n\n````smart header=\"Works with any iterable on the right-side\"\n\n...Actually, we can use it with any iterable, not only arrays:\n\n```js\nlet [a, b, c] = \"abc\"; // [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\nlet [one, two, three] = new Set([1, 2, 3]);\n```\n\n````\n\n\n````smart header=\"Assign to anything at the left-side\"\n\nWe can use any \"assignables\" at the left side.\n\nFor instance, an object property:\n```js run\nlet user = {};\n[user.name, user.surname] = \"Ilya Kantor\".split(' ');\n\nalert(user.name); // Ilya\n```\n\n````\n\n````smart header=\"Looping with .entries()\"\n\nIn the previous chapter we saw the [Object.entries(obj)](mdn:js/Object/entries) method.\n\nWe can use it with destructuring to loop over keys-and-values of an object:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30\n};\n\n// loop over keys-and-values\n*!*\nfor (let [key, value] of Object.entries(user)) {\n*/!*\n  alert(`${key}:${value}`); // name:John, then age:30\n}\n```\n\n...And the same for a map:\n\n```js run\nlet user = new Map();\nuser.set(\"name\", \"John\");\nuser.set(\"age\", \"30\");\n\n*!*\nfor (let [key, value] of user) {\n*/!*\n  alert(`${key}:${value}`); // name:John, then age:30\n}\n```\n````\n\n```smart header=\"Swap variables trick\"\nA well-known trick for swapping values of two variables:\n\n```js run\nlet guest = \"Jane\";\nlet admin = \"Pete\";\n\n// Swap values: make guest=Pete, admin=Jane\n[guest, admin] = [admin, guest];\n\nalert(`${guest} ${admin}`); // Pete Jane (successfully swapped!)\n```\n\nHere we create a temporary array of two variables and immediately destructure it in swapped order.\n\nWe can swap more than two variables this way.\n\n\n### The rest '...'\n\nIf we want not just to get first values, but also to gather all that follows -- we can add one more parameter that gets \"the rest\" using three dots `\"...\"`:\n\n```js run\nlet [name1, name2, *!*...rest*/!*] = [\"Julius\", \"Caesar\", *!*\"Consul\", \"of the Roman Republic\"*/!*];\n\nalert(name1); // Julius\nalert(name2); // Caesar\n\n*!*\n// Note that type of `rest` is Array.\nalert(rest[0]); // Consul\nalert(rest[1]); // of the Roman Republic\nalert(rest.length); // 2\n*/!*\n```\n\nThe value of `rest` is the array of the remaining array elements. We can use any other variable name in place of `rest`, just make sure it has three dots before it and goes last in the destructuring assignment.\n\n### Default values\n\nIf there are fewer values in the array than variables in the assignment, there will be no error. Absent values are considered undefined:\n\n```js run\n*!*\nlet [firstName, surname] = [];\n*/!*\n\nalert(firstName); // undefined\nalert(surname); // undefined\n```\n\nIf we want a \"default\" value to replace the missing one, we can provide it using `=`:\n\n```js run\n*!*\n// default values\nlet [name = \"Guest\", surname = \"Anonymous\"] = [\"Julius\"];\n*/!*\n\nalert(name);    // Julius (from array)\nalert(surname); // Anonymous (default used)\n```\n\nDefault values can be more complex expressions or even function calls. They are evaluated only if the value is not provided.\n\nFor instance, here we use the `prompt` function for two defaults. But it will run only for the missing one:\n\n```js run\n// runs only prompt for surname\nlet [name = prompt('name?'), surname = prompt('surname?')] = [\"Julius\"];\n\nalert(name);    // Julius (from array)\nalert(surname); // whatever prompt gets\n```\n\n\n\n## Object destructuring\n\nThe destructuring assignment also works with objects.\n\nThe basic syntax is:\n\n```js\nlet {var1, var2} = {var1:…, var2:…}\n```\n\nWe have an existing object at the right side, that we want to split into variables. The left side contains a \"pattern\" for corresponding properties. In the simple case, that's a list of variable names in `{...}`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet options = {\n  title: \"Menu\",\n  width: 100,\n  height: 200\n};\n\n*!*\nlet {title, width, height} = options;\n*/!*\n\nalert(title);  // Menu\nalert(width);  // 100\nalert(height); // 200\n```\n\nProperties `options.title`, `options.width` and `options.height` are assigned to the corresponding variables. The order does not matter. This works too:\n\n```js\n// changed the order in let {...}\nlet {height, width, title} = { title: \"Menu\", height: 200, width: 100 }\n```\n\nThe pattern on the left side may be more complex and specify the mapping between properties and variables.\n\nIf we want to assign a property to a variable with another name, for instance, `options.width` to go into the variable named `w`, then we can set it using a colon:\n\n```js run\nlet options = {\n  title: \"Menu\",\n  width: 100,\n  height: 200\n};\n\n*!*\n// { sourceProperty: targetVariable }\nlet {width: w, height: h, title} = options;\n*/!*\n\n// width -> w\n// height -> h\n// title -> title\n\nalert(title);  // Menu\nalert(w);      // 100\nalert(h);      // 200\n```\n\nThe colon shows \"what : goes where\". In the example above the property `width` goes to `w`, property `height` goes to `h`, and `title` is assigned to the same name.\n\nFor potentially missing properties we can set default values using `\"=\"`, like this:\n\n```js run\nlet options = {\n  title: \"Menu\"\n};\n\n*!*\nlet {width = 100, height = 200, title} = options;\n*/!*\n\nalert(title);  // Menu\nalert(width);  // 100\nalert(height); // 200\n```\n\nJust like with arrays or function parameters, default values can be any expressions or even function calls. They will be evaluated if the value is not provided.\n\nIn the code below `prompt` asks for `width`, but not for `title`:\n\n```js run\nlet options = {\n  title: \"Menu\"\n};\n\n*!*\nlet {width = prompt(\"width?\"), title = prompt(\"title?\")} = options;\n*/!*\n\nalert(title);  // Menu\nalert(width);  // (whatever the result of prompt is)\n```\n\nWe also can combine both the colon and equality:\n\n```js run\nlet options = {\n  title: \"Menu\"\n};\n\n*!*\nlet {width: w = 100, height: h = 200, title} = options;\n*/!*\n\nalert(title);  // Menu\nalert(w);      // 100\nalert(h);      // 200\n```\n\nIf we have a complex object with many properties, we can extract only what we need:\n\n```js run\nlet options = {\n  title: \"Menu\",\n  width: 100,\n  height: 200\n};\n\n// only extract title as a variable\nlet { title } = options;\n\nalert(title); // Menu\n```\n\n### The rest pattern \"...\"\n\nWhat if the object has more properties than we have variables? Can we take some and then assign the \"rest\" somewhere?\n\nWe can use the rest pattern, just like we did with arrays. It's not supported by some older browsers (IE, use Babel to polyfill it), but works in modern ones.\n\nIt looks like this:\n\n```js run\nlet options = {\n  title: \"Menu\",\n  height: 200,\n  width: 100\n};\n\n*!*\n// title = property named title\n// rest = object with the rest of properties\nlet {title, ...rest} = options;\n*/!*\n\n// now title=\"Menu\", rest={height: 200, width: 100}\nalert(rest.height);  // 200\nalert(rest.width);   // 100\n```\n\n````smart header=\"Gotcha if there's no `let`\"\nIn the examples above variables were declared right in the assignment: `let {…} = {…}`. Of course, we could use existing variables too, without `let`. But there's a catch.\n\nThis won't work:\n```js run\nlet title, width, height;\n\n// error in this line\n{title, width, height} = {title: \"Menu\", width: 200, height: 100};\n```\n\nThe problem is that JavaScript treats `{...}` in the main code flow (not inside another expression) as a code block. Such code blocks can be used to group statements, like this:\n\n```js run\n{\n  // a code block\n  let message = \"Hello\";\n  // ...\n  alert( message );\n}\n```\n\nSo here JavaScript assumes that we have a code block, that's why there's an error. We want destructuring instead.\n\nTo show JavaScript that it's not a code block, we can wrap the expression in parentheses `(...)`:\n\n```js run\nlet title, width, height;\n\n// okay now\n*!*(*/!*{title, width, height} = {title: \"Menu\", width: 200, height: 100}*!*)*/!*;\n\nalert( title ); // Menu\n```\n````\n\n## Nested destructuring\n\nIf an object or an array contain other nested objects and arrays, we can use more complex left-side patterns to extract deeper portions.\n\nIn the code below `options` has another object in the property `size` and an array in the property `items`. The pattern at the left side of the assignment has the same structure to extract values from them:\n\n```js run\nlet options = {\n  size: {\n    width: 100,\n    height: 200\n  },\n  items: [\"Cake\", \"Donut\"],\n  extra: true   \n};\n\n// destructuring assignment split in multiple lines for clarity\nlet {\n  size: { // put size here\n    width,\n    height\n  },\n  items: [item1, item2], // assign items here\n  title = \"Menu\" // not present in the object (default value is used)\n} = options;\n\nalert(title);  // Menu\nalert(width);  // 100\nalert(height); // 200\nalert(item1);  // Cake\nalert(item2);  // Donut\n```\n\nAll properties of `options` object except `extra` that is absent in the left part, are assigned to corresponding variables:\n\n![](destructuring-complex.svg)\n\nFinally, we have `width`, `height`, `item1`, `item2` and `title` from the default value.\n\nNote that there are no variables for `size` and `items`, as we take their content instead.\n\n## Smart function parameters\n\nThere are times when a function has many parameters, most of which are optional. That's especially true for user interfaces. Imagine a function that creates a menu. It may have a width, a height, a title, items list and so on.\n\nHere's a bad way to write such function:\n\n```js\nfunction showMenu(title = \"Untitled\", width = 200, height = 100, items = []) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn real-life, the problem is how to remember the order of arguments. Usually IDEs try to help us, especially if the code is well-documented, but still... Another problem is how to call a function when most parameters are ok by default.\n\nLike this?\n\n```js\n// undefined where default values are fine\nshowMenu(\"My Menu\", undefined, undefined, [\"Item1\", \"Item2\"])\n```\n\nThat's ugly. And becomes unreadable when we deal with more parameters.\n\nDestructuring comes to the rescue!\n\nWe can pass parameters as an object, and the function immediately destructurizes them into variables:\n\n```js run\n// we pass object to function\nlet options = {\n  title: \"My menu\",\n  items: [\"Item1\", \"Item2\"]\n};\n\n// ...and it immediately expands it to variables\nfunction showMenu(*!*{title = \"Untitled\", width = 200, height = 100, items = []}*/!*) {\n  // title, items – taken from options,\n  // width, height – defaults used\n  alert( `${title} ${width} ${height}` ); // My Menu 200 100\n  alert( items ); // Item1, Item2\n}\n\nshowMenu(options);\n```\n\nWe can also use more complex destructuring with nested objects and colon mappings:\n\n```js run\nlet options = {\n  title: \"My menu\",\n  items: [\"Item1\", \"Item2\"]\n};\n\n*!*\nfunction showMenu({\n  title = \"Untitled\",\n  width: w = 100,  // width goes to w\n  height: h = 200, // height goes to h\n  items: [item1, item2] // items first element goes to item1, second to item2\n}) {\n*/!*\n  alert( `${title} ${w} ${h}` ); // My Menu 100 200\n  alert( item1 ); // Item1\n  alert( item2 ); // Item2\n}\n\nshowMenu(options);\n```\n\nThe full syntax is the same as for a destructuring assignment:\n```js\nfunction({\n  incomingProperty: varName = defaultValue\n  ...\n})\n```\n\nThen, for an object of parameters, there will be a variable `varName` for property `incomingProperty`, with `defaultValue` by default.\n\nPlease note that such destructuring assumes that `showMenu()` does have an argument. If we want all values by default, then we should specify an empty object:\n\n```js\nshowMenu({}); // ok, all values are default\n\nshowMenu(); // this would give an error\n```\n\nWe can fix this by making `{}` the default value for the whole object of parameters:\n\n```js run\nfunction showMenu({ title = \"Menu\", width = 100, height = 200 }*!* = {}*/!*) {\n  alert( `${title} ${width} ${height}` );\n}\n\nshowMenu(); // Menu 100 200\n```\n\nIn the code above, the whole arguments object is `{}` by default, so there's always something to destructurize.\n\n## Summary\n\n- Destructuring assignment allows for instantly mapping an object or array onto many variables.\n- The full object syntax:\n    ```js\n    let {prop : varName = default, ...rest} = object\n    ```\n\n    This means that property `prop` should go into the variable `varName` and, if no such property exists, then the `default` value should be used.\n\n    Object properties that have no mapping are copied to the `rest` object.\n\n- The full array syntax:\n\n    ```js\n    let [item1 = default, item2, ...rest] = array\n    ```\n\n    The first item goes to `item1`; the second goes into `item2`, all the rest makes the array `rest`.\n\n- It's possible to extract data from nested arrays/objects, for that the left side must have the same structure as the right one.",

        "content": "\n\nLet's meet a new built-in object: [Date](mdn:js/Date). It stores the date, time and provides methods for date/time management.\n\nFor instance, we can use it to store creation/modification times, to measure time, or just to print out the current date.\n\n## Creation\n\nTo create a new `Date` object call `new Date()` with one of the following arguments:\n\n`new Date()`\n: Without arguments -- create a `Date` object for the current date and time:\n\n    ```js run\n    let now = new Date();\n    alert( now ); // shows current date/time\n    ```\n\n`new Date(milliseconds)`\n: Create a `Date` object with the time equal to number of milliseconds (1/1000 of a second) passed after the Jan 1st of 1970 UTC+0.\n\n    ```js run\n    // 0 means 01.01.1970 UTC+0\n    let Jan01_1970 = new Date(0);\n    alert( Jan01_1970 );\n\n    // now add 24 hours, get 02.01.1970 UTC+0\n    let Jan02_1970 = new Date(24 * 3600 * 1000);\n    alert( Jan02_1970 );\n    ```\n\n    An integer number representing the number of milliseconds that has passed since the beginning of 1970 is called a *timestamp*.\n\n    It's a lightweight numeric representation of a date. We can always create a date from a timestamp using `new Date(timestamp)` and convert the existing `Date` object to a timestamp using the `date.getTime()` method (see below).\n\n    Dates before 01.01.1970 have negative timestamps, e.g.:\n    ```js run\n    // 31 Dec 1969\n    let Dec31_1969 = new Date(-24 * 3600 * 1000);\n    alert( Dec31_1969 );\n    ```\n\n`new Date(datestring)`\n: If there is a single argument, and it's a string, then it is parsed automatically. The algorithm is the same as `Date.parse` uses, we'll cover it later.\n\n    ```js run\n    let date = new Date(\"2017-01-26\");\n    alert(date);\n    // The time is not set, so it's assumed to be midnight GMT and\n    // is adjusted according to the timezone the code is run in\n    // So the result could be\n    // Thu Jan 26 2017 11:00:00 GMT+1100 (Australian Eastern Daylight Time)\n    // or\n    // Wed Jan 25 2017 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)\n    ```\n\n`new Date(year, month, date, hours, minutes, seconds, ms)`\n: Create the date with the given components in the local time zone. Only the first two arguments are obligatory.\n\n    - The `year` must have 4 digits: `2013` is okay, `98` is not.\n    - The `month` count starts with `0` (Jan), up to `11` (Dec).\n    - The `date` parameter is actually the day of month, if absent then `1` is assumed.\n    - If `hours/minutes/seconds/ms` is absent, they are assumed to be equal `0`.\n\n    For instance:\n\n    ```js\n    new Date(2011, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0); // 1 Jan 2011, 00:00:00\n    new Date(2011, 0, 1); // the same, hours etc are 0 by default\n    ```\n\n    The minimal precision is 1 ms (1/1000 sec):\n\n    ```js run\n    let date = new Date(2011, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 567);\n    alert( date ); // 1.01.2011, 02:03:04.567\n    ```\n\n## Access date components\n\nThere are methods to access the year, month and so on from the `Date` object:\n\n[getFullYear()](mdn:js/Date/getFullYear)\n: Get the year (4 digits)\n\n[getMonth()](mdn:js/Date/getMonth)\n: Get the month, **from 0 to 11**.\n\n[getDate()](mdn:js/Date/getDate)\n: Get the day of month, from 1 to 31, the name of the method does look a little bit strange.\n\n[getHours()](mdn:js/Date/getHours), [getMinutes()](mdn:js/Date/getMinutes), [getSeconds()](mdn:js/Date/getSeconds), [getMilliseconds()](mdn:js/Date/getMilliseconds)\n: Get the corresponding time components.\n\n```warn header=\"Not `getYear()`, but `getFullYear()`\"\nMany JavaScript engines implement a non-standard method `getYear()`. This method is deprecated. It returns 2-digit year sometimes. Please never use it. There is `getFullYear()` for the year.\n```\n\nAdditionally, we can get a day of week:\n\n[getDay()](mdn:js/Date/getDay)\n: Get the day of week, from `0` (Sunday) to `6` (Saturday). The first day is always Sunday, in some countries that's not so, but can't be changed.\n\n**All the methods above return the components relative to the local time zone.**\n\nThere are also their UTC-counterparts, that return day, month, year and so on for the time zone UTC+0: [getUTCFullYear()](mdn:js/Date/getUTCFullYear), [getUTCMonth()](mdn:js/Date/getUTCMonth), [getUTCDay()](mdn:js/Date/getUTCDay). Just insert the `\"UTC\"` right after `\"get\"`.\n\nIf your local time zone is shifted relative to UTC, then the code below shows different hours:\n\n```js run\n// current date\nlet date = new Date();\n\n// the hour in your current time zone\nalert( date.getHours() );\n\n// the hour in UTC+0 time zone (London time without daylight savings)\nalert( date.getUTCHours() );\n```\n\nBesides the given methods, there are two special ones that do not have a UTC-variant:\n\n[getTime()](mdn:js/Date/getTime)\n: Returns the timestamp for the date -- a number of milliseconds passed from the January 1st of 1970 UTC+0.\n\n[getTimezoneOffset()](mdn:js/Date/getTimezoneOffset)\n: Returns the difference between UTC and the local time zone, in minutes:\n\n    ```js run\n    // if you are in timezone UTC-1, outputs 60\n    // if you are in timezone UTC+3, outputs -180\n    alert( new Date().getTimezoneOffset() );\n\n    ```\n\n## Setting date components\n\nThe following methods allow to set date/time components:\n\n- [`setFullYear(year, [month], [date])`](mdn:js/Date/setFullYear)\n- [`setMonth(month, [date])`](mdn:js/Date/setMonth)\n- [`setDate(date)`](mdn:js/Date/setDate)\n- [`setHours(hour, [min], [sec], [ms])`](mdn:js/Date/setHours)\n- [`setMinutes(min, [sec], [ms])`](mdn:js/Date/setMinutes)\n- [`setSeconds(sec, [ms])`](mdn:js/Date/setSeconds)\n- [`setMilliseconds(ms)`](mdn:js/Date/setMilliseconds)\n- [`setTime(milliseconds)`](mdn:js/Date/setTime) (sets the whole date by milliseconds since 01.01.1970 UTC)\n\nEvery one of them except `setTime()` has a UTC-variant, for instance: `setUTCHours()`.\n\nAs we can see, some methods can set multiple components at once, for example `setHours`. The components that are not mentioned are not modified.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet today = new Date();\n\ntoday.setHours(0);\nalert(today); // still today, but the hour is changed to 0\n\ntoday.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);\nalert(today); // still today, now 00:00:00 sharp.\n```\n\n## Autocorrection\n\nThe *autocorrection* is a very handy feature of `Date` objects. We can set out-of-range values, and it will auto-adjust itself.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet date = new Date(2013, 0, *!*32*/!*); // 32 Jan 2013 ?!?\nalert(date); // ...is 1st Feb 2013!\n```\n\nOut-of-range date components are distributed automatically.\n\nLet's say we need to increase the date \"28 Feb 2016\" by 2 days. It may be \"2 Mar\" or \"1 Mar\" in case of a leap-year. We don't need to think about it. Just add 2 days. The `Date` object will do the rest:\n\n```js run\nlet date = new Date(2016, 1, 28);\n*!*\ndate.setDate(date.getDate() + 2);\n*/!*\n\nalert( date ); // 1 Mar 2016\n```\n\nThat feature is often used to get the date after the given period of time. For instance, let's get the date for \"70 seconds after now\":\n\n```js run\nlet date = new Date();\ndate.setSeconds(date.getSeconds() + 70);\n\nalert( date ); // shows the correct date\n```\n\nWe can also set zero or even negative values. For example:\n\n```js run\nlet date = new Date(2016, 0, 2); // 2 Jan 2016\n\ndate.setDate(1); // set day 1 of month\nalert( date );\n\ndate.setDate(0); // min day is 1, so the last day of the previous month is assumed\nalert( date ); // 31 Dec 2015\n```\n\n## Date to number, date diff\n\nWhen a `Date` object is converted to number, it becomes the timestamp same as `date.getTime()`:\n\n```js run\nlet date = new Date();\nalert(+date); // the number of milliseconds, same as date.getTime()\n```\n\nThe important side effect: dates can be subtracted, the result is their difference in ms.\n\nThat can be used for time measurements:\n\n```js run\nlet start = new Date(); // start measuring time\n\n// do the job\nfor (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {\n  let doSomething = i * i * i;\n}\n\nlet end = new Date(); // end measuring time\n\nalert( `The loop took ${end - start} ms` );\n```\n\n## Date.now()\n\nIf we only want to measure time, we don't need the `Date` object.\n\nThere's a special method `Date.now()` that returns the current timestamp.\n\nIt is semantically equivalent to `new Date().getTime()`, but it doesn't create an intermediate `Date` object. So it's faster and doesn't put pressure on garbage collection.\n\nIt is used mostly for convenience or when performance matters, like in games in JavaScript or other specialized applications.\n\nSo this is probably better:\n\n```js run\n*!*\nlet start = Date.now(); // milliseconds count from 1 Jan 1970\n*/!*\n\n// do the job\nfor (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {\n  let doSomething = i * i * i;\n}\n\n*!*\nlet end = Date.now(); // done\n*/!*\n\nalert( `The loop took ${end - start} ms` ); // subtract numbers, not dates\n```\n\n## Benchmarking\n\nIf we want a reliable benchmark of CPU-hungry function, we should be careful.\n\nFor instance, let's measure two functions that calculate the difference between two dates: which one is faster?\n\nSuch performance measurements are often called \"benchmarks\".\n\n```js\n// we have date1 and date2, which function faster returns their difference in ms?\nfunction diffSubtract(date1, date2) {\n  return date2 - date1;\n}\n\n// or\nfunction diffGetTime(date1, date2) {\n  return date2.getTime() - date1.getTime();\n}\n```\n\nThese two do exactly the same thing, but one of them uses an explicit `date.getTime()` to get the date in ms, and the other one relies on a date-to-number transform. Their result is always the same.\n\nSo, which one is faster?\n\nThe first idea may be to run them many times in a row and measure the time difference. For our case, functions are very simple, so we have to do it at least 100000 times.\n\nLet's measure:\n\n```js run\nfunction diffSubtract(date1, date2) {\n  return date2 - date1;\n}\n\nfunction diffGetTime(date1, date2) {\n  return date2.getTime() - date1.getTime();\n}\n\nfunction bench(f) {\n  let date1 = new Date(0);\n  let date2 = new Date();\n\n  let start = Date.now();\n  for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) f(date1, date2);\n  return Date.now() - start;\n}\n\nalert( 'Time of diffSubtract: ' + bench(diffSubtract) + 'ms' );\nalert( 'Time of diffGetTime: ' + bench(diffGetTime) + 'ms' );\n```\n\nWow! Using `getTime()` is so much faster! That's because there's no type conversion, it is much easier for engines to optimize.\n\nOkay, we have something. But that's not a good benchmark yet.\n\nImagine that at the time of running `bench(diffSubtract)` CPU was doing something in parallel, and it was taking resources. And by the time of running `bench(diffGetTime)` that work has finished.\n\nA pretty real scenario for a modern multi-process OS.\n\nAs a result, the first benchmark will have less CPU resources than the second. That may lead to wrong results.\n\n**For more reliable benchmarking, the whole pack of benchmarks should be rerun multiple times.**\n\nFor example, like this:\n\n```js run\nfunction diffSubtract(date1, date2) {\n  return date2 - date1;\n}\n\nfunction diffGetTime(date1, date2) {\n  return date2.getTime() - date1.getTime();\n}\n\nfunction bench(f) {\n  let date1 = new Date(0);\n  let date2 = new Date();\n\n  let start = Date.now();\n  for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) f(date1, date2);\n  return Date.now() - start;\n}\n\nlet time1 = 0;\nlet time2 = 0;\n\n*!*\n// run bench(upperSlice) and bench(upperLoop) each 10 times alternating\nfor (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  time1 += bench(diffSubtract);\n  time2 += bench(diffGetTime);\n}\n*/!*\n\nalert( 'Total time for diffSubtract: ' + time1 );\nalert( 'Total time for diffGetTime: ' + time2 );\n```\n\nModern JavaScript engines start applying advanced optimizations only to \"hot code\" that executes many times (no need to optimize rarely executed things). So, in the example above, first executions are not well-optimized. We may want to add a heat-up run:\n\n```js\n// added for \"heating up\" prior to the main loop\nbench(diffSubtract);\nbench(diffGetTime);\n\n// now benchmark\nfor (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  time1 += bench(diffSubtract);\n  time2 += bench(diffGetTime);\n}\n```\n\n```warn header=\"Be careful doing microbenchmarking\"\nModern JavaScript engines perform many optimizations. They may tweak results of \"artificial tests\" compared to \"normal usage\", especially when we benchmark something very small, such as how an operator works, or a built-in function. So if you seriously want to understand performance, then please study how the JavaScript engine works. And then you probably won't need microbenchmarks at all.\n\nThe great pack of articles about V8 can be found at <http://mrale.ph>.\n```\n\n## Date.parse from a string\n\nThe method [Date.parse(str)](mdn:js/Date/parse) can read a date from a string.\n\nThe string format should be: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`, where:\n\n- `YYYY-MM-DD` -- is the date: year-month-day.\n- The character `\"T\"` is used as the delimiter.\n- `HH:mm:ss.sss` -- is the time: hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.\n- The optional `'Z'` part denotes the time zone in the format `+-hh:mm`. A single letter `Z` that would mean UTC+0.\n\nShorter variants are also possible, like `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM` or even `YYYY`.\n\nThe call to `Date.parse(str)` parses the string in the given format and returns the timestamp (number of milliseconds from 1 Jan 1970 UTC+0). If the format is invalid, returns `NaN`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet ms = Date.parse('2012-01-26T13:51:50.417-07:00');\n\nalert(ms); // 1327611110417  (timestamp)\n```\n\nWe can instantly create a `new Date` object from the timestamp:\n\n```js run\nlet date = new Date( Date.parse('2012-01-26T13:51:50.417-07:00') );\n\nalert(date);  \n```\n\n## Summary\n\n- Date and time in JavaScript are represented with the [Date](mdn:js/Date) object. We can't create \"only date\" or \"only time\": `Date` objects always carry both.\n- Months are counted from zero (yes, January is a zero month).\n- Days of week in `getDay()` are also counted from zero (that's Sunday).\n- `Date` auto-corrects itself when out-of-range components are set. Good for adding/subtracting days/months/hours.\n- Dates can be subtracted, giving their difference in milliseconds. That's because a `Date` becomes the timestamp when converted to a number.\n- Use `Date.now()` to get the current timestamp fast.\n\nNote that unlike many other systems, timestamps in JavaScript are in milliseconds, not in seconds.\n\nSometimes we need more precise time measurements. JavaScript itself does not have a way to measure time in microseconds (1 millionth of a second), but most environments provide it. For instance, browser has [performance.now()](mdn:api/Performance/now) that gives the number of milliseconds from the start of page loading with microsecond precision (3 digits after the point):\n\n```js run\nalert(`Loading started ${performance.now()}ms ago`);\n// Something like: \"Loading started 34731.26000000001ms ago\"\n// .26 is microseconds (260 microseconds)\n// more than 3 digits after the decimal point are precision errors, but only the first 3 are correct\n```\n\nNode.js has `microtime` module and other ways. Technically, almost any device and environment allows to get more precision, it's just not in `Date`.",

Updating such `toString` every time can become a pain. We could try to loop over properties in it, but what if the object is complex and has nested objects in properties? We'd need to implement their conversion as well.\n\nLuckily, there's no need to write the code to handle all this. The task has been solved already.\n\n## JSON.stringify\n\nThe [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) (JavaScript Object Notation) is a general format to represent values and objects. It is described as in [RFC 4627](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627) standard. Initially it was made for JavaScript, but many other languages have libraries to handle it as well.  So it's easy to use JSON for data exchange when the client uses JavaScript and the server is written on Ruby/PHP/Java/Whatever.\n\nJavaScript provides methods:\n\n- `JSON.stringify` to convert objects into JSON.\n- `JSON.parse` to convert JSON back into an object.\n\nFor instance, here we `JSON.stringify` a student:\n```js run\nlet student = {\n  name: 'John',\n  age: 30,\n  isAdmin: false,\n  courses: ['html', 'css', 'js'],\n  wife: null\n};\n\n*!*\nlet json = JSON.stringify(student);\n*/!*\n\nalert(typeof json); // we've got a string!\n\nalert(json);\n*!*\n/* JSON-encoded object:\n{\n  \"name\": \"John\",\n  \"age\": 30,\n  \"isAdmin\": false,\n  \"courses\": [\"html\", \"css\", \"js\"],\n  \"wife\": null\n}\n*/\n*/!*\n```\n\nThe method `JSON.stringify(student)` takes the object and converts it into a string.\n\nThe resulting `json` string is called a *JSON-encoded* or *serialized* or *stringified* or *marshalled* object. We are ready to send it over the wire or put into a plain data store.\n\n\nPlease note that a JSON-encoded object has several important differences from the object literal:\n\n- Strings use double quotes. No single quotes or backticks in JSON. So `'John'` becomes `\"John\"`.\n- Object property names are double-quoted also. That's obligatory. So `age:30` becomes `\"age\":30`.\n\n`JSON.stringify` can be applied to primitives as well.\n\nJSON supports following data types:\n\n- Objects `{ ... }`\n- Arrays `[ ... ]`\n- Primitives:\n    - strings,\n    - numbers,\n    - boolean values `true/false`,\n    - `null`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\n// a number in JSON is just a number\nalert( JSON.stringify(1) ) // 1\n\n// a string in JSON is still a string, but double-quoted\nalert( JSON.stringify('test') ) // \"test\"\n\nalert( JSON.stringify(true) ); // true\n\nalert( JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3]) ); // [1,2,3]\n```\n\nJSON is data-only language-independent specification, so some JavaScript-specific object properties are skipped by `JSON.stringify`.\n\nNamely:\n\n- Function properties (methods).\n- Symbolic properties.\n- Properties that store `undefined`.\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  sayHi() { // ignored\n    alert(\"Hello\");\n  },\n  [Symbol(\"id\")]: 123, // ignored\n  something: undefined // ignored\n};\n\nalert( JSON.stringify(user) ); // {} (empty object)\n```\n\nUsually that's fine. If that's not what we want, then soon we'll see how to customize the process.\n\nThe great thing is that nested objects are supported and converted automatically.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet meetup = {\n  title: \"Conference\",\n*!*\n  room: {\n    number: 23,\n    participants: [\"john\", \"ann\"]\n  }\n*/!*\n};\n\nalert( JSON.stringify(meetup) );\n/* The whole structure is stringified:\n{\n  \"title\":\"Conference\",\n  \"room\":{\"number\":23,\"participants\":[\"john\",\"ann\"]},\n}\n*/\n```\n\nThe important limitation: there must be no circular references.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet room = {\n  number: 23\n};\n\nlet meetup = {\n  title: \"Conference\",\n  participants: [\"john\", \"ann\"]\n};\n\nmeetup.place = room;       // meetup references room\nroom.occupiedBy = meetup; // room references meetup\n\n*!*\nJSON.stringify(meetup); // Error: Converting circular structure to JSON\n*/!*\n```\n\nHere, the conversion fails, because of circular reference: `room.occupiedBy` references `meetup`, and `meetup.place` references `room`:\n\n![](json-meetup.svg)\n\n\n## Excluding and transforming: replacer\n\nThe full syntax of `JSON.stringify` is:\n\n```js\nlet json = JSON.stringify(value[, replacer, space])\n```\n\nvalue\n: A value to encode.\n\nreplacer\n: Array of properties to encode or a mapping function `function(key, value)`.\n\nspace\n: Amount of space to use for formatting\n\nMost of the time, `JSON.stringify` is used with the first argument only. But if we need to fine-tune the replacement process, like to filter out circular references, we can use the second argument of `JSON.stringify`.\n\nIf we pass an array of properties to it, only these properties will be encoded.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet room = {\n  number: 23\n};\n\nlet meetup = {\n  title: \"Conference\",\n  participants: [{name: \"John\"}, {name: \"Alice\"}],\n  place: room // meetup references room\n};\n\nroom.occupiedBy = meetup; // room references meetup\n\nalert( JSON.stringify(meetup, *!*['title', 'participants']*/!*) );\n// {\"title\":\"Conference\",\"participants\":[{},{}]}\n```\n\nHere we are probably too strict. The property list is applied to the whole object structure. So the objects in `participants` are empty, because `name` is not in the list.\n\nLet's include in the list every property except `room.occupiedBy` that would cause the circular reference:\n\n```js run\nlet room = {\n  number: 23\n};\n\nlet meetup = {\n  title: \"Conference\",\n  participants: [{name: \"John\"}, {name: \"Alice\"}],\n  place: room // meetup references room\n};\n\nroom.occupiedBy = meetup; // room references meetup\n\nalert( JSON.stringify(meetup, *!*['title', 'participants', 'place', 'name', 'number']*/!*) );\n/*\n{\n  \"title\":\"Conference\",\n  \"participants\":[{\"name\":\"John\"},{\"name\":\"Alice\"}],\n  \"place\":{\"number\":23}\n}\n*/\n```\n\nNow everything except `occupiedBy` is serialized. But the list of properties is quite long.\n\nFortunately, we can use a function instead of an array as the `replacer`.\n\nThe function will be called for every `(key, value)` pair and should return the \"replaced\" value, which will be used instead of the original one. Or `undefined` if the value is to be skipped.\n\nIn our case, we can return `value` \"as is\" for everything except `occupiedBy`. To ignore `occupiedBy`, the code below returns `undefined`:\n\n```js run\nlet room = {\n  number: 23\n};\n\nlet meetup = {\n  title: \"Conference\",\n  participants: [{name: \"John\"}, {name: \"Alice\"}],\n  place: room // meetup references room\n};\n\nroom.occupiedBy = meetup; // room references meetup\n\nalert( JSON.stringify(meetup, function replacer(key, value) {\n  alert(`${key}: ${value}`);\n  return (key == 'occupiedBy') ? undefined : value;\n}));\n\n/* key:value pairs that come to replacer:\n:             [object Object]\ntitle:        Conference\nparticipants: [object Object],[object Object]\n0:            [object Object]\nname:         John\n1:            [object Object]\nname:         Alice\nplace:        [object Object]\nnumber:       23\n*/\n```\n\nPlease note that `replacer` function gets every key/value pair including nested objects and array items. It is applied recursively. The value of `this` inside `replacer` is the object that contains the current property.\n\nThe first call is special. It is made using a special \"wrapper object\": `{\"\": meetup}`. In other words, the first `(key, value)` pair has an empty key, and the value is the target object as a whole. That's why the first line is `\":[object Object]\"` in the example above.\n\nThe idea is to provide as much power for `replacer` as possible: it has a chance to analyze and replace/skip even the whole object if necessary.\n\n\n## Formatting: space\n\nThe third argument of `JSON.stringify(value, replacer, space)` is the number of spaces to use for pretty formatting.\n\nPreviously, all stringified objects had no indents and extra spaces. That's fine if we want to send an object over a network. The `space` argument is used exclusively for a nice output.\n\nHere `space = 2` tells JavaScript to show nested objects on multiple lines, with indentation of 2 spaces inside an object:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 25,\n  roles: {\n    isAdmin: false,\n    isEditor: true\n  }\n};\n\nalert(JSON.stringify(user, null, 2));\n/* two-space indents:\n{\n  \"name\": \"John\",\n  \"age\": 25,\n  \"roles\": {\n    \"isAdmin\": false,\n    \"isEditor\": true\n  }\n}\n*/\n\n/* for JSON.stringify(user, null, 4) the result would be more indented:\n{\n    \"name\": \"John\",\n    \"age\": 25,\n    \"roles\": {\n        \"isAdmin\": false,\n        \"isEditor\": true\n    }\n}\n*/\n```\n\nThe `space` parameter is used solely for logging and nice-output purposes.\n\n## Custom \"toJSON\"\n\nLike `toString` for string conversion, an object may provide method `toJSON` for to-JSON conversion. `JSON.stringify` automatically calls it if available.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet room = {\n  number: 23\n};\n\nlet meetup = {\n  title: \"Conference\",\n  date: new Date(Date.UTC(2017, 0, 1)),\n  room\n};\n\nalert( JSON.stringify(meetup) );\n/*\n  {\n    \"title\":\"Conference\",\n*!*\n    \"date\":\"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",  // (1)\n*/!*\n    \"room\": {\"number\":23}               // (2)\n  }\n*/\n```\n\nHere we can see that `date` `(1)` became a string. That's because all dates have a built-in `toJSON` method which returns such kind of string.\n\nNow let's add a custom `toJSON` for our object `room` `(2)`:\n\n```js run\nlet room = {\n  number: 23,\n*!*\n  toJSON() {\n    return this.number;\n  }\n*/!*\n};\n\nlet meetup = {\n  title: \"Conference\",\n  room\n};\n\n*!*\nalert( JSON.stringify(room) ); // 23\n*/!*\n\nalert( JSON.stringify(meetup) );\n/*\n  {\n    \"title\":\"Conference\",\n*!*\n    \"room\": 23\n*/!*\n  }\n*/\n```\n\nAs we can see, `toJSON` is used both for the direct call `JSON.stringify(room)` and when `room` is nested in another encoded object.\n\n\n## JSON.parse\n\nTo decode a JSON-string, we need another method named [JSON.parse](mdn:js/JSON/parse).\n\nThe syntax:\n```js\nlet value = JSON.parse(str, [reviver]);\n```\n\nstr\n: JSON-string to parse.\n\nreviver\n: Optional function(key,value) that will be called for each `(key, value)` pair and can transform the value.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\n// stringified array\nlet numbers = \"[0, 1, 2, 3]\";\n\nnumbers = JSON.parse(numbers);\n\nalert( numbers[1] ); // 1\n```\n\nOr for nested objects:\n\n```js run\nlet userData = '{ \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 35, \"isAdmin\": false, \"friends\": [0,1,2,3] }';\n\nlet user = JSON.parse(userData);\n\nalert( user.friends[1] ); // 1\n```\n\nThe JSON may be as complex as necessary, objects and arrays can include other objects and arrays. But they must obey the same JSON format.\n\nHere are typical mistakes in hand-written JSON (sometimes we have to write it for debugging purposes):\n\n```js\nlet json = `{\n  *!*name*/!*: \"John\",                     // mistake: property name without quotes\n  \"surname\": *!*'Smith'*/!*,               // mistake: single quotes in value (must be double)\n  *!*'isAdmin'*/!*: false                  // mistake: single quotes in key (must be double)\n  \"birthday\": *!*new Date(2000, 2, 3)*/!*, // mistake: no \"new\" is allowed, only bare values\n  \"friends\": [0,1,2,3]              // here all fine\n}`;\n```\n\nBesides, JSON does not support comments. Adding a comment to JSON makes it invalid.\n\nThere's another format named [JSON5](http://json5.org/), which allows unquoted keys, comments etc. But this is a standalone library, not in the specification of the language.\n\nThe regular JSON is that strict not because its developers are lazy, but to allow easy, reliable and very fast implementations of the parsing algorithm.\n\n## Using reviver\n\nImagine, we got a stringified `meetup` object from the server.\n\nIt looks like this:\n\n```js\n// title: (meetup title), date: (meetup date)\nlet str = '{\"title\":\"Conference\",\"date\":\"2017-11-30T12:00:00.000Z\"}';\n```\n\n...And now we need to *deserialize* it, to turn back into JavaScript object.\n\nLet's do it by calling `JSON.parse`:\n\n```js run\nlet str = '{\"title\":\"Conference\",\"date\":\"2017-11-30T12:00:00.000Z\"}';\n\nlet meetup = JSON.parse(str);\n\n*!*\nalert( meetup.date.getDate() ); // Error!\n*/!*\n```\n\nWhoops! An error!\n\nThe value of `meetup.date` is a string, not a `Date` object. How could `JSON.parse` know that it should transform that string into a `Date`?\n\nLet's pass to `JSON.parse` the reviving function as the second argument, that returns all values \"as is\", but `date` will become a `Date`:\n\n```js run\nlet str = '{\"title\":\"Conference\",\"date\":\"2017-11-30T12:00:00.000Z\"}';\n\n*!*\nlet meetup = JSON.parse(str, function(key, value) {\n  if (key == 'date') return new Date(value);\n  return value;\n});\n*/!*\n\nalert( meetup.date.getDate() ); // now works!\n```\n\nBy the way, that works for nested objects as well:\n\n```js run\nlet schedule = `{\n  \"meetups\": [\n    {\"title\":\"Conference\",\"date\":\"2017-11-30T12:00:00.000Z\"},\n    {\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"date\":\"2017-04-18T12:00:00.000Z\"}\n  ]\n}`;\n\nschedule = JSON.parse(schedule, function(key, value) {\n  if (key == 'date') return new Date(value);\n  return value;\n});\n\n*!*\nalert( schedule.meetups[1].date.getDate() ); // works!\n*/!*\n```\n\n\n\n## Summary\n\n- JSON is a data format that has its own independent standard and libraries for most programming languages.\n- JSON supports plain objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and `null`.\n- JavaScript provides methods [JSON.stringify](mdn:js/JSON/stringify) to serialize into JSON and [JSON.parse](mdn:js/JSON/parse) to read from JSON.\n- Both methods support transformer functions for smart reading/writing.\n- If an object has `toJSON`, then it is called by `JSON.stringify`.",

        "content": "\n\nLet's return to functions and study them more in-depth.\n\nOur first topic will be *recursion*.\n\nIf you are not new to programming, then it is probably familiar and you could skip this chapter.\n\nRecursion is a programming pattern that is useful in situations when a task can be naturally split into several tasks of the same kind, but simpler. Or when a task can be simplified into an easy action plus a simpler variant of the same task. Or, as we'll see soon, to deal with certain data structures.\n\nWhen a function solves a task, in the process it can call many other functions. A partial case of this is when a function calls *itself*. That's called *recursion*.\n\n## Two ways of thinking\n\nFor something simple to start with -- let's write a function `pow(x, n)` that raises `x` to a natural power of `n`. In other words, multiplies `x` by itself `n` times.\n\n```js\npow(2, 2) = 4\npow(2, 3) = 8\npow(2, 4) = 16\n```\n\nThere are two ways to implement it.\n\n1. Iterative thinking: the `for` loop:\n\n    ```js run\n    function pow(x, n) {\n      let result = 1;\n\n      // multiply result by x n times in the loop\n      for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        result *= x;\n      }\n\n      return result;\n    }\n\n    alert( pow(2, 3) ); // 8\n    ```\n\n2. Recursive thinking: simplify the task and call self:\n\n    ```js run\n    function pow(x, n) {\n      if (n == 1) {\n        return x;\n      } else {\n        return x * pow(x, n - 1);\n      }\n    }\n\n    alert( pow(2, 3) ); // 8\n    ```\n\nPlease note how the recursive variant is fundamentally different.\n\nWhen `pow(x, n)` is called, the execution splits into two branches:\n\n```js\n              if n==1  = x\n             /\npow(x, n) =\n             \\       \n              else     = x * pow(x, n - 1)\n```\n\n1. If `n == 1`, then everything is trivial. It is called *the base* of recursion, because it immediately produces the obvious result: `pow(x, 1)` equals `x`.\n2. Otherwise, we can represent `pow(x, n)` as `x * pow(x, n - 1)`. In maths, one would write <code>x<sup>n</sup> = x * x<sup>n-1</sup></code>. This is called *a recursive step*: we transform the task into a simpler action (multiplication by `x`) and a simpler call of the same task (`pow` with lower `n`). Next steps simplify it further and further until `n` reaches `1`.\n\nWe can also say that `pow` *recursively calls itself* till `n == 1`.\n\n![recursive diagram of pow](recursion-pow.svg)\n\n\nFor example, to calculate `pow(2, 4)` the recursive variant does these steps:\n\n1. `pow(2, 4) = 2 * pow(2, 3)`\n2. `pow(2, 3) = 2 * pow(2, 2)`\n3. `pow(2, 2) = 2 * pow(2, 1)`\n4. `pow(2, 1) = 2`\n\nSo, the recursion reduces a function call to a simpler one, and then -- to even more simpler, and so on, until the result becomes obvious.\n\n````smart header=\"Recursion is usually shorter\"\nA recursive solution is usually shorter than an iterative one.\n\nHere we can rewrite the same using the conditional operator `?` instead of `if` to make `pow(x, n)` more terse and still very readable:\n\n```js run\nfunction pow(x, n) {\n  return (n == 1) ? x : (x * pow(x, n - 1));\n}\n```\n````\n\nThe maximal number of nested calls (including the first one) is called *recursion depth*. In our case, it will be exactly `n`.\n\nThe maximal recursion depth is limited by JavaScript engine. We can rely on it being 10000, some engines allow more, but 100000 is probably out of limit for the majority of them. There are automatic optimizations that help alleviate this (\"tail calls optimizations\"), but they are not yet supported everywhere and work only in simple cases.\n\nThat limits the application of recursion, but it still remains very wide. There are many tasks where recursive way of thinking gives simpler code, easier to maintain.\n\n## The execution context and stack\n\nNow let's examine how recursive calls work. For that we'll look under the hood of functions.\n\nThe information about the process of execution of a running function is stored in its *execution context*.\n\nThe [execution context](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-execution-contexts) is an internal data structure that contains details about the execution of a function: where the control flow is now, the current variables, the value of `this` (we don't use it here) and few other internal details.\n\nOne function call has exactly one execution context associated with it.\n\nWhen a function makes a nested call, the following happens:\n\n- The current function is paused.\n- The execution context associated with it is remembered in a special data structure called *execution context stack*.\n- The nested call executes.\n- After it ends, the old execution context is retrieved from the stack, and the outer function is resumed from where it stopped.\n\nLet's see what happens during the `pow(2, 3)` call.\n\n### pow(2, 3)\n\nIn the beginning of the call `pow(2, 3)` the execution context will store variables: `x = 2, n = 3`, the execution flow is at line `1` of the function.\n\nWe can sketch it as:\n\n<ul class=\"function-execution-context-list\">\n  <li>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context\">Context: { x: 2, n: 3, at line 1 }</span>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context-call\">pow(2, 3)</span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\nThat's when the function starts to execute. The condition `n == 1` is false, so the flow continues into the second branch of `if`:\n\n```js run\nfunction pow(x, n) {\n  if (n == 1) {\n    return x;\n  } else {\n*!*\n    return x * pow(x, n - 1);\n*/!*\n  }\n}\n\nalert( pow(2, 3) );\n```\n\n\nThe variables are same, but the line changes, so the context is now:\n\n<ul class=\"function-execution-context-list\">\n  <li>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context\">Context: { x: 2, n: 3, at line 5 }</span>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context-call\">pow(2, 3)</span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\nTo calculate `x * pow(x, n - 1)`, we need to make a subcall of `pow` with new arguments `pow(2, 2)`.\n\n### pow(2, 2)\n\nTo do a nested call, JavaScript remembers the current execution context in the *execution context stack*.\n\nHere we call the same function `pow`, but it absolutely doesn't matter. The process is the same for all functions:\n\n1. The current context is \"remembered\" on top of the stack.\n2. The new context is created for the subcall.\n3. When the subcall is finished -- the previous context is popped from the stack, and its execution continues.\n\nHere's the context stack when we entered the subcall `pow(2, 2)`:\n\n<ul class=\"function-execution-context-list\">\n  <li>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context\">Context: { x: 2, n: 2, at line 1 }</span>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context-call\">pow(2, 2)</span>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context\">Context: { x: 2, n: 3, at line 5 }</span>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context-call\">pow(2, 3)</span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\nThe new current execution context is on top (and bold), and previous remembered contexts are below.\n\nWhen we finish the subcall -- it is easy to resume the previous context, because it keeps both variables and the exact place of the code where it stopped.\n\n```smart\nHere in the picture we use the word \"line\", as our example there's only one subcall in line, but generally a single line of code may contain multiple subcalls, like `pow(…) + pow(…) + somethingElse(…)`.\n\nSo it would be more precise to say that the execution resumes \"immediately after the subcall\".\n```\n\n### pow(2, 1)\n\nThe process repeats: a new subcall is made at line `5`, now with arguments `x=2`, `n=1`.\n\nA new execution context is created, the previous one is pushed on top of the stack:\n\n<ul class=\"function-execution-context-list\">\n  <li>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context\">Context: { x: 2, n: 1, at line 1 }</span>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context-call\">pow(2, 1)</span>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context\">Context: { x: 2, n: 2, at line 5 }</span>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context-call\">pow(2, 2)</span>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context\">Context: { x: 2, n: 3, at line 5 }</span>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context-call\">pow(2, 3)</span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\nThere are 2 old contexts now and 1 currently running for `pow(2, 1)`.\n\n### The exit\n\nDuring the execution of `pow(2, 1)`, unlike before, the condition `n == 1` is truthy, so the first branch of `if` works:\n\n```js\nfunction pow(x, n) {\n  if (n == 1) {\n*!*\n    return x;\n*/!*\n  } else {\n    return x * pow(x, n - 1);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThere are no more nested calls, so the function finishes, returning `2`.\n\nAs the function finishes, its execution context is not needed anymore, so it's removed from the memory. The previous one is restored off the top of the stack:\n\n\n<ul class=\"function-execution-context-list\">\n  <li>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context\">Context: { x: 2, n: 2, at line 5 }</span>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context-call\">pow(2, 2)</span>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context\">Context: { x: 2, n: 3, at line 5 }</span>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context-call\">pow(2, 3)</span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\nThe execution of `pow(2, 2)` is resumed. It has the result of the subcall `pow(2, 1)`, so it also can finish the evaluation of `x * pow(x, n - 1)`, returning `4`.\n\nThen the previous context is restored:\n\n<ul class=\"function-execution-context-list\">\n  <li>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context\">Context: { x: 2, n: 3, at line 5 }</span>\n    <span class=\"function-execution-context-call\">pow(2, 3)</span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\nWhen it finishes, we have a result of `pow(2, 3) = 8`.\n\nThe recursion depth in this case was: **3**.\n\nAs we can see from the illustrations above, recursion depth equals the maximal number of context in the stack.\n\nNote the memory requirements. Contexts take memory. In our case, raising to the power of `n` actually requires the memory for `n` contexts, for all lower values of `n`.\n\nA loop-based algorithm is more memory-saving:\n\n```js\nfunction pow(x, n) {\n  let result = 1;\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    result *= x;\n  }\n\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\nThe iterative `pow` uses a single context changing `i` and `result` in the process. Its memory requirements are small, fixed and do not depend on `n`.\n\n**Any recursion can be rewritten as a loop. The loop variant usually can be made more effective.**\n\n...But sometimes the rewrite is non-trivial, especially when function uses different recursive subcalls depending on conditions and merges their results or when the branching is more intricate. And the optimization may be unneeded and totally not worth the efforts.\n\nRecursion can give a shorter code, easier to understand and support. Optimizations are not required in every place, mostly we need a good code, that's why it's used.\n\n## Recursive traversals\n\nAnother great application of the recursion is a recursive traversal.\n\nImagine, we have a company. The staff structure can be presented as an object:\n\n```js\nlet company = {\n  sales: [{\n    name: 'John',\n    salary: 1000\n  }, {\n    name: 'Alice',\n    salary: 1600\n  }],\n\n  development: {\n    sites: [{\n      name: 'Peter',\n      salary: 2000\n    }, {\n      name: 'Alex',\n      salary: 1800\n    }],\n\n    internals: [{\n      name: 'Jack',\n      salary: 1300\n    }]\n  }\n};\n```\n\nIn other words, a company has departments.\n\n- A department may have an array of staff. For instance, `sales` department has 2 employees: John and Alice.\n- Or a department may split into subdepartments, like `development` has two branches: `sites` and `internals`. Each of them has their own staff.\n- It is also possible that when a subdepartment grows, it divides into subsubdepartments (or teams).\n\n    For instance, the `sites` department in the future may be split into teams for `siteA` and `siteB`. And they, potentially, can split even more. That's not on the picture, just something to have in mind.\n\nNow let's say we want a function to get the sum of all salaries. How can we do that?\n\nAn iterative approach is not easy, because the structure is not simple. The first idea may be to make a `for` loop over `company` with nested subloop over 1st level departments. But then we need more nested subloops to iterate over the staff in 2nd level departments like `sites`... And then another subloop inside those for 3rd level departments that might appear in the future? If we put 3-4 nested subloops in the code to traverse a single object, it becomes rather ugly.\n\nLet's try recursion.\n\nAs we can see, when our function gets a department to sum, there are two possible cases:\n\n1. Either it's a \"simple\" department with an *array* of people -- then we can sum the salaries in a simple loop.\n2. Or it's *an object* with `N` subdepartments -- then we can make `N` recursive calls to get the sum for each of the subdeps and combine the results.\n\nThe 1st case is the base of recursion, the trivial case, when we get an array.\n\nThe 2nd case when we get an object is the recursive step. A complex task is split into subtasks for smaller departments. They may in turn split again, but sooner or later the split will finish at (1).\n\nThe algorithm is probably even easier to read from the code:\n\n\n```js run\nlet company = { // the same object, compressed for brevity\n  sales: [{name: 'John', salary: 1000}, {name: 'Alice', salary: 1600 }],\n  development: {\n    sites: [{name: 'Peter', salary: 2000}, {name: 'Alex', salary: 1800 }],\n    internals: [{name: 'Jack', salary: 1300}]\n  }\n};\n\n// The function to do the job\n*!*\nfunction sumSalaries(department) {\n  if (Array.isArray(department)) { // case (1)\n    return department.reduce((prev, current) => prev + current.salary, 0); // sum the array\n  } else { // case (2)\n    let sum = 0;\n    for (let subdep of Object.values(department)) {\n      sum += sumSalaries(subdep); // recursively call for subdepartments, sum the results\n    }\n    return sum;\n  }\n}\n*/!*\n\nalert(sumSalaries(company)); // 7700\n```\n\nThe code is short and easy to understand (hopefully?). That's the power of recursion. It also works for any level of subdepartment nesting.\n\nHere's the diagram of calls:\n\n![recursive salaries](recursive-salaries.svg)\n\nWe can easily see the principle: for an object `{...}` subcalls are made, while arrays `[...]` are the \"leaves\" of the recursion tree, they give immediate result.\n\nNote that the code uses smart features that we've covered before:\n\n- Method `arr.reduce` explained in the chapter <info:array-methods> to get the sum of the array.\n- Loop `for(val of Object.values(obj))` to iterate over object values: `Object.values` returns an array of them.\n\n\n## Recursive structures\n\nA recursive (recursively-defined) data structure is a structure that replicates itself in parts.\n\nWe've just seen it in the example of a company structure above.\n\nA company *department* is:\n- Either an array of people.\n- Or an object with *departments*.\n\nFor web-developers there are much better-known examples: HTML and XML documents.\n\nIn the HTML document, an *HTML-tag* may contain a list of:\n- Text pieces.\n- HTML-comments.\n- Other *HTML-tags* (that in turn may contain text pieces/comments or other tags etc).\n\nThat's once again a recursive definition.\n\nFor better understanding, we'll cover one more recursive structure named \"Linked list\" that might be a better alternative for arrays in some cases.\n\n### Linked list\n\nImagine, we want to store an ordered list of objects.\n\nThe natural choice would be an array:\n\n```js\nlet arr = [obj1, obj2, obj3];\n```\n\n...But there's a problem with arrays. The \"delete element\" and \"insert element\" operations are expensive. For instance, `arr.unshift(obj)` operation has to renumber all elements to make room for a new `obj`, and if the array is big, it takes time. Same with `arr.shift()`.\n\nThe only structural modifications that do not require mass-renumbering are those that operate with the end of array: `arr.push/pop`. So an array can be quite slow for big queues, when we have to work with the beginning.\n\nAlternatively, if we really need fast insertion/deletion, we can choose another data structure called a [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list).\n\nThe *linked list element* is recursively defined as an object with:\n- `value`.\n- `next` property referencing the next *linked list element* or `null` if that's the end.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js\nlet list = {\n  value: 1,\n  next: {\n    value: 2,\n    next: {\n      value: 3,\n      next: {\n        value: 4,\n        next: null\n      }\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\nGraphical representation of the list:\n\n![linked list](linked-list.svg)\n\nAn alternative code for creation:\n\n```js no-beautify\nlet list = { value: 1 };\nlist.next = { value: 2 };\nlist.next.next = { value: 3 };\nlist.next.next.next = { value: 4 };\nlist.next.next.next.next = null;\n```\n\nHere we can even more clearly see that there are multiple objects, each one has the `value` and `next` pointing to the neighbour. The `list` variable is the first object in the chain, so following `next` pointers from it we can reach any element.\n\nThe list can be easily split into multiple parts and later joined back:\n\n```js\nlet secondList = list.next.next;\nlist.next.next = null;\n```\n\n![linked list split](linked-list-split.svg)\n\nTo join:\n\n```js\nlist.next.next = secondList;\n```\n\nAnd surely we can insert or remove items in any place.\n\nFor instance, to prepend a new value, we need to update the head of the list:\n\n```js\nlet list = { value: 1 };\nlist.next = { value: 2 };\nlist.next.next = { value: 3 };\nlist.next.next.next = { value: 4 };\n\n*!*\n// prepend the new value to the list\nlist = { value: \"new item\", next: list };\n*/!*\n```\n\n![linked list](linked-list-0.svg)\n\nTo remove a value from the middle, change `next` of the previous one:\n\n```js\nlist.next = list.next.next;\n```\n\n![linked list](linked-list-remove-1.svg)\n\nWe made `list.next` jump over `1` to value `2`. The value `1` is now excluded from the chain. If it's not stored anywhere else, it will be automatically removed from the memory.\n\nUnlike arrays, there's no mass-renumbering, we can easily rearrange elements.\n\nNaturally, lists are not always better than arrays. Otherwise everyone would use only lists.\n\nThe main drawback is that we can't easily access an element by its number. In an array that's easy: `arr[n]` is a direct reference. But in the list we need to start from the first item and go `next` `N` times to get the Nth element.\n\n...But we don't always need such operations. For instance, when we need a queue or even a [deque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue) -- the ordered structure that must allow very fast adding/removing elements from both ends, but access to its middle is not needed.\n\nLists can be enhanced:\n- We can add property `prev` in addition to `next` to reference the previous element, to move back easily.\n- We can also add a variable named `tail` referencing the last element of the list (and update it when adding/removing elements from the end).\n- ...The data structure may vary according to our needs.\n\n## Summary\n\nTerms:\n- *Recursion*  is a programming term that means calling a function from itself. Recursive functions can be used to solve tasks in elegant ways.\n\n    When a function calls itself, that's called a *recursion step*. The *basis* of recursion is function arguments that make the task so simple that the function does not make further calls.\n\n- A [recursively-defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_data_type) data structure is a data structure that can be defined using itself.\n\n    For instance, the linked list can be defined as a data structure consisting of an object referencing a list (or null).\n\n    ```js\n    list = { value, next -> list }\n    ```\n\n    Trees like HTML elements tree or the department tree from this chapter are also naturally recursive: they branch and every branch can have other branches.\n\n    Recursive functions can be used to walk them as we've seen in the `sumSalary` example.\n\nAny recursive function can be rewritten into an iterative one. And that's sometimes required to optimize stuff. But for many tasks a recursive solution is fast enough and easier to write and support.",

But if the JavaScript engine does not support tail call optimization (most of them don't), there will be an error: maximum stack size exceeded, because there's usually a limitation on the total stack size.",

For instance, `fib(77)` may hang up the engine for some time eating all CPU resources.\n\nThat's because the function makes too many subcalls. The same values are re-evaluated again and again.\n\nFor instance, let's see a piece of calculations for `fib(5)`:\n\n```js no-beautify\n...\nfib(5) = fib(4) + fib(3)\nfib(4) = fib(3) + fib(2)\n...\n```\n\nHere we can see that the value of `fib(3)` is needed for both `fib(5)` and `fib(4)`.

On each step we only need to remember two previous values.\n\nHere are the steps of the new algorithm in details.\n\nThe start:\n\n```js\n// a = fib(1), b = fib(2), these values are by definition 1\nlet a = 1, b = 1;\n\n// get c = fib(3) as their sum\nlet c = a + b;\n\n/* we now have fib(1), fib(2), fib(3)\na  b  c\n1, 1, 2\n*/\n```\n\nNow we want to get `fib(4) = fib(2) + fib(3)`.\n\nLet's shift the variables: `a,b` will get `fib(2),fib(3)`, and `c` will get their sum:\n\n```js no-beautify\na = b; // now a = fib(2)\nb = c; // now b = fib(3)\nc = a + b; // c = fib(4)\n\n/* now we have the sequence:\n   a  b  c\n1, 1, 2, 3\n*/\n```\n\nThe next step gives another sequence number:\n\n```js no-beautify\na = b; // now a = fib(3)\nb = c; // now b = fib(4)\nc = a + b; // c = fib(5)\n\n/* now the sequence is (one more number):\n      a  b  c\n1, 1, 2, 3, 5\n*/\n```\n\n...And so on until we get the needed value. That's much faster than recursion and involves no duplicate computations.\n\nThe full code:\n\n```js run\nfunction fib(n) {\n  let a = 1;\n  let b = 1;\n  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {\n    let c = a + b;\n    a = b;\n    b = c;\n  }\n  return b;\n}\n\nalert( fib(3) ); // 2\nalert( fib(7) ); // 13\nalert( fib(77) ); // 5527939700884757\n```\n\nThe loop starts with `i=3`, because the first and the second sequence values are hard-coded into variables `a=1`, `b=1`.\n\nThe approach is called [dynamic programming bottom-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming).",

        "content": "\n\nMany JavaScript built-in functions support an arbitrary number of arguments.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- `Math.max(arg1, arg2, ..., argN)` -- returns the greatest of the arguments.\n- `Object.assign(dest, src1, ..., srcN)` -- copies properties from `src1..N` into `dest`.\n- ...and so on.\n\nIn this chapter we'll learn how to do the same. And also, how to pass arrays to such functions as parameters.\n\n## Rest parameters `...`\n\nA function can be called with any number of arguments, no matter how it is defined.\n\nLike here:\n```js run\nfunction sum(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nalert( sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) );\n```\n\nThere will be no error because of \"excessive\" arguments. But of course in the result only the first two will be counted.\n\nThe rest of the parameters can be included in the function definition by using three dots `...` followed by the name of the array that will contain them. The dots literally mean \"gather the remaining parameters into an array\".\n\nFor instance, to gather all arguments into array `args`:\n\n```js run\nfunction sumAll(...args) { // args is the name for the array\n  let sum = 0;\n\n  for (let arg of args) sum += arg;\n\n  return sum;\n}\n\nalert( sumAll(1) ); // 1\nalert( sumAll(1, 2) ); // 3\nalert( sumAll(1, 2, 3) ); // 6\n```\n\nWe can choose to get the first parameters as variables, and gather only the rest.\n\nHere the first two arguments go into variables and the rest go into `titles` array:\n\n```js run\nfunction showName(firstName, lastName, ...titles) {\n  alert( firstName + ' ' + lastName ); // Julius Caesar\n\n  // the rest go into titles array\n  // i.e. titles = [\"Consul\", \"Imperator\"]\n  alert( titles[0] ); // Consul\n  alert( titles[1] ); // Imperator\n  alert( titles.length ); // 2\n}\n\nshowName(\"Julius\", \"Caesar\", \"Consul\", \"Imperator\");\n```\n\n````warn header=\"The rest parameters must be at the end\"\nThe rest parameters gather all remaining arguments, so the following does not make sense and causes an error:\n\n```js\nfunction f(arg1, ...rest, arg2) { // arg2 after ...rest ?!\n  // error\n}\n```\n\nThe `...rest` must always be last.\n````\n\n## The \"arguments\" variable\n\nThere is also a special array-like object named `arguments` that contains all arguments by their index.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nfunction showName() {\n  alert( arguments.length );\n  alert( arguments[0] );\n  alert( arguments[1] );\n\n  // it's iterable\n  // for(let arg of arguments) alert(arg);\n}\n\n// shows: 2, Julius, Caesar\nshowName(\"Julius\", \"Caesar\");\n\n// shows: 1, Ilya, undefined (no second argument)\nshowName(\"Ilya\");\n```\n\nIn old times, rest parameters did not exist in the language, and using `arguments` was the only way to get all arguments of the function. And it still works, we can find it in the old code.\n\nBut the downside is that although `arguments` is both array-like and iterable, it's not an array. It does not support array methods, so we can't call `arguments.map(...)` for example.\n\nAlso, it always contains all arguments. We can't capture them partially, like we did with rest parameters.\n\nSo when we need these features, then rest parameters are preferred.\n\n````smart header=\"Arrow functions do not have `\\\"arguments\\\"`\"\nIf we access the `arguments` object from an arrow function, it takes them from the outer \"normal\" function.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```js run\nfunction f() {\n  let showArg = () => alert(arguments[0]);\n  showArg();\n}\n\nf(1); // 1\n```\n\nAs we remember, arrow functions don't have their own `this`. Now we know they don't have the special `arguments` object either.\n````\n\n\n## Spread syntax [#spread-syntax]\n\nWe've just seen how to get an array from the list of parameters.\n\nBut sometimes we need to do exactly the reverse.\n\nFor instance, there's a built-in function [Math.max](mdn:js/Math/max) that returns the greatest number from a list:\n\n```js run\nalert( Math.max(3, 5, 1) ); // 5\n```\n\nNow let's say we have an array `[3, 5, 1]`. How do we call `Math.max` with it?\n\nPassing it \"as is\" won't work, because `Math.max` expects a list of numeric arguments, not a single array:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [3, 5, 1];\n\n*!*\nalert( Math.max(arr) ); // NaN\n*/!*\n```\n\nAnd surely we can't manually list items in the code `Math.max(arr[0], arr[1], arr[2])`, because we may be unsure how many there are. As our script executes, there could be a lot, or there could be none. And that would get ugly.\n\n*Spread syntax* to the rescue! It looks similar to rest parameters, also using `...`, but does quite the opposite.\n\nWhen `...arr` is used in the function call, it \"expands\" an iterable object `arr` into the list of arguments.\n\nFor `Math.max`:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [3, 5, 1];\n\nalert( Math.max(...arr) ); // 5 (spread turns array into a list of arguments)\n```\n\nWe also can pass multiple iterables this way:\n\n```js run\nlet arr1 = [1, -2, 3, 4];\nlet arr2 = [8, 3, -8, 1];\n\nalert( Math.max(...arr1, ...arr2) ); // 8\n```\n\nWe can even combine the spread syntax with normal values:\n\n\n```js run\nlet arr1 = [1, -2, 3, 4];\nlet arr2 = [8, 3, -8, 1];\n\nalert( Math.max(1, ...arr1, 2, ...arr2, 25) ); // 25\n```\n\nAlso, the spread syntax can be used to merge arrays:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [3, 5, 1];\nlet arr2 = [8, 9, 15];\n\n*!*\nlet merged = [0, ...arr, 2, ...arr2];\n*/!*\n\nalert(merged); // 0,3,5,1,2,8,9,15 (0, then arr, then 2, then arr2)\n```\n\nIn the examples above we used an array to demonstrate the spread syntax, but any iterable will do.\n\nFor instance, here we use the spread syntax to turn the string into array of characters:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"Hello\";\n\nalert( [...str] ); // H,e,l,l,o\n```\n\nThe spread syntax internally uses iterators to gather elements, the same way as `for..of` does.\n\nSo, for a string, `for..of` returns characters and `...str` becomes `\"H\",\"e\",\"l\",\"l\",\"o\"`. The list of characters is passed to array initializer `[...str]`.\n\nFor this particular task we could also use `Array.from`, because it converts an iterable (like a string) into an array:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"Hello\";\n\n// Array.from converts an iterable into an array\nalert( Array.from(str) ); // H,e,l,l,o\n```\n\nThe result is the same as `[...str]`.\n\nBut there's a subtle difference between `Array.from(obj)` and `[...obj]`:\n\n- `Array.from` operates on both array-likes and iterables.\n- The spread syntax works only with iterables.\n\nSo, for the task of turning something into an array, `Array.from` tends to be more universal.\n\n\n## Get a new copy of an array/object\n\nRemember when we talked about `Object.assign()` [in the past](info:object-copy#cloning-and-merging-object-assign)?\n\nIt is possible to do the same thing with the spread syntax.\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [1, 2, 3];\nlet arrCopy = [...arr]; // spread the array into a list of parameters\n                        // then put the result into a new array\n\n// do the arrays have the same contents?\nalert(JSON.stringify(arr) === JSON.stringify(arrCopy)); // true\n\n// are the arrays equal?\nalert(arr === arrCopy); // false (not same reference)\n\n// modifying our initial array does not modify the copy:\narr.push(4);\nalert(arr); // 1, 2, 3, 4\nalert(arrCopy); // 1, 2, 3\n```\n\nNote that it is possible to do the same thing to make a copy of an object:\n\n```js run\nlet obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };\nlet objCopy = { ...obj }; // spread the object into a list of parameters\n                          // then return the result in a new object\n\n// do the objects have the same contents?\nalert(JSON.stringify(obj) === JSON.stringify(objCopy)); // true\n\n// are the objects equal?\nalert(obj === objCopy); // false (not same reference)\n\n// modifying our initial object does not modify the copy:\nobj.d = 4;\nalert(JSON.stringify(obj)); // {\"a\":1,\"b\":2,\"c\":3,\"d\":4}\nalert(JSON.stringify(objCopy)); // {\"a\":1,\"b\":2,\"c\":3}\n```\n\nThis way of copying an object is much shorter than `let objCopy = Object.assign({}, obj);` or for an array `let arrCopy = Object.assign([], arr);` so we prefer to use it whenever we can.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nWhen we see `\"...\"` in the code, it is either rest parameters or the spread syntax.\n\nThere's an easy way to distinguish between them:\n\n- When `...` is at the end of function parameters, it's \"rest parameters\" and gathers the rest of the list of arguments into an array.\n- When `...` occurs in a function call or alike, it's called a \"spread syntax\" and expands an array into a list.\n\nUse patterns:\n\n- Rest parameters are used to create functions that accept any number of arguments.\n- The spread syntax is used to pass an array to functions that normally require a list of many arguments.\n\nTogether they help to travel between a list and an array of parameters with ease.\n\nAll arguments of a function call are also available in \"old-style\" `arguments`: array-like iterable object.",

        "content": "\n\nJavaScript is a very function-oriented language. It gives us a lot of freedom. A function can be created dynamically, passed as an argument to another function and called from a totally different place of code later.\n\nWe already know that a function can access variables outside of it.\n\nNow let's expand our knowledge to include more complex scenarios.\n\n```smart header=\"We'll talk about `let/const` variables here\"\nIn JavaScript, there are 3 ways to declare a variable: `let`, `const` (the modern ones), and `var` (the remnant of the past).\n\n- In this article we'll use `let` variables in examples.\n- Variables, declared with `const`, behave the same, so this article is about `const` too.\n- The old `var` has some notable differences, they will be covered in the article <info:var>.\n```\n\n## Code blocks\n\nIf a variable is declared inside a code block `{...}`, it's only visible inside that block.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\n{\n  // do some job with local variables that should not be seen outside\n\n  let message = \"Hello\"; // only visible in this block\n\n  alert(message); // Hello\n}\n\nalert(message); // Error: message is not defined\n```\n\nWe can use this to isolate a piece of code that does its own task, with variables that only belong to it:\n\n```js run\n{\n  // show message\n  let message = \"Hello\";\n  alert(message);\n}\n\n{\n  // show another message\n  let message = \"Goodbye\";\n  alert(message);\n}\n```\n\n````smart header=\"There'd be an error without blocks\"\nPlease note, without separate blocks there would be an error, if we use `let` with the existing variable name:\n\n```js run\n// show message\nlet message = \"Hello\";\nalert(message);\n\n// show another message\n*!*\nlet message = \"Goodbye\"; // Error: variable already declared\n*/!*\nalert(message);\n```\n````\n\nFor `if`, `for`, `while` and so on, variables declared in `{...}` are also only visible inside:\n\n```js run\nif (true) {\n  let phrase = \"Hello!\";\n\n  alert(phrase); // Hello!\n}\n\nalert(phrase); // Error, no such variable!\n```\n\nHere, after `if` finishes, the `alert` below won't see the `phrase`, hence the error.\n\nThat's great, as it allows us to create block-local variables, specific to an `if` branch.\n\nThe similar thing holds true for `for` and `while` loops:\n\n```js run\nfor (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n  // the variable i is only visible inside this for\n  alert(i); // 0, then 1, then 2\n}\n\nalert(i); // Error, no such variable\n```\n\nVisually, `let i` is outside of `{...}`. But the `for` construct is special here: the variable, declared inside it, is considered a part of the block.\n\n## Nested functions\n\nA function is called \"nested\" when it is created inside another function.\n\nIt is easily possible to do this with JavaScript.\n\nWe can use it to organize our code, like this:\n\n```js\nfunction sayHiBye(firstName, lastName) {\n\n  // helper nested function to use below\n  function getFullName() {\n    return firstName + \" \" + lastName;\n  }\n\n  alert( \"Hello, \" + getFullName() );\n  alert( \"Bye, \" + getFullName() );\n\n}\n```\n\nHere the *nested* function `getFullName()` is made for convenience. It can access the outer variables and so can return the full name. Nested functions are quite common in JavaScript.\n\nWhat's much more interesting, a nested function can be returned: either as a property of a new object or as a result by itself. It can then be used somewhere else. No matter where, it still has access to the same outer variables.\n\nBelow, `makeCounter` creates the \"counter\" function that returns the next number on each invocation:\n\n```js run\nfunction makeCounter() {\n  let count = 0;\n\n  return function() {\n    return count++;\n  };\n}\n\nlet counter = makeCounter();\n\nalert( counter() ); // 0\nalert( counter() ); // 1\nalert( counter() ); // 2\n```\n\nDespite being simple, slightly modified variants of that code have practical uses, for instance, as a [random number generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator) to generate random values for automated tests.\n\nHow does this work? If we create multiple counters, will they be independent? What's going on with the variables here?\n\nUndestanding such things is great for the overall knowledge of JavaScript and beneficial for more complex scenarios. So let's go a bit in-depth.\n\n## Lexical Environment\n\n```warn header=\"Here be dragons!\"\nThe in-depth technical explanation lies ahead.\n\nAs far as I'd like to avoid low-level language details, any understanding without them would be lacking and incomplete, so get ready.\n```\n\nFor clarity, the explanation is split into multiple steps.\n\n### Step 1. Variables\n\nIn JavaScript, every running function, code block `{...}`, and the script as a whole have an internal (hidden) associated object known as the *Lexical Environment*.\n\nThe Lexical Environment object consists of two parts:\n\n1. *Environment Record* -- an object that stores all local variables as its properties (and some other information like the value of `this`).\n2. A reference to the *outer lexical environment*, the one associated with the outer code.\n\n**A \"variable\" is just a property of the special internal object, `Environment Record`. \"To get or change a variable\" means \"to get or change a property of that object\".**\n\nIn this simple code without functions, there is only one Lexical Environment:\n\n![lexical environment](lexical-environment-global.svg)\n\nThis is the so-called *global* Lexical Environment, associated with the whole script.\n\nOn the picture above, the rectangle means Environment Record (variable store) and the arrow means the outer reference. The global Lexical Environment has no outer reference, that's why the arrow points to `null`.\n\nAs the code starts executing and goes on, the Lexical Environment changes.\n\nHere's a little bit longer code:\n\n![lexical environment](closure-variable-phrase.svg)\n\nRectangles on the right-hand side demonstrate how the global Lexical Environment changes during the execution:\n\n1. When the script starts, the Lexical Environment is pre-populated with all declared variables.\n    - Initially, they are in the \"Uninitialized\" state. That's a special internal state, it means that the engine knows about the variable, but it cannot be referenced until it has been declared with `let`. It's almost the same as if the variable didn't exist.\n2. Then `let phrase` definition appears. There's no assignment yet, so its value is `undefined`. We can use the variable since this moment.\n3. `phrase` is assigned a value.\n4. `phrase` changes the value.\n\nEverything looks simple for now, right?\n\n- A variable is a property of a special internal object, associated with the currently executing block/function/script.\n- Working with variables is actually working with the properties of that object.\n\n```smart header=\"Lexical Environment is a specification object\"\n\"Lexical Environment\" is a specification object: it only exists \"theoretically\" in the [language specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-lexical-environments) to describe how things work. We can't get this object in our code and manipulate it directly.\n\nJavaScript engines also may optimize it, discard variables that are unused to save memory and perform other internal tricks, as long as the visible behavior remains as described.\n```\n\n### Step 2. Function Declarations\n\nA function is also a value, like a variable.\n\n**The difference is that a Function Declaration is instantly fully initialized.**\n\nWhen a Lexical Environment is created, a Function Declaration immediately becomes a ready-to-use function (unlike `let`, that is unusable till the declaration).\n\nThat's why we can use a function, declared as Function Declaration, even before the declaration itself.\n\nFor example, here's the initial state of the global Lexical Environment when we add a function:\n\n![](closure-function-declaration.svg)\n\nNaturally, this behavior only applies to Function Declarations, not Function Expressions where we assign a function to a variable, such as `let say = function(name)...`.\n\n### Step 3. Inner and outer Lexical Environment\n\nWhen a function runs, at the beginning of the call, a new Lexical Environment is created automatically to store local variables and parameters of the call.\n\nFor instance, for `say(\"John\")`, it looks like this (the execution is at the line, labelled with an arrow):\n\n<!--\n    ```js\n    let phrase = \"Hello\";\n\n    function say(name) {\n     alert( `${phrase}, ${name}` );\n    }\n\n    say(\"John\"); // Hello, John\n    ```-->\n\n![](lexical-environment-simple.svg)\n\nDuring the function call we have two Lexical Environments: the inner one (for the function call) and the outer one (global):\n\n- The inner Lexical Environment corresponds to the current execution of `say`. It has a single property: `name`, the function argument. We called `say(\"John\")`, so the value of the `name` is `\"John\"`.\n- The outer Lexical Environment is the global Lexical Environment. It has the `phrase` variable and the function itself.\n\nThe inner Lexical Environment has a reference to the `outer` one.\n\n**When the code wants to access a variable -- the inner Lexical Environment is searched first, then the outer one, then the more outer one and so on until the global one.**\n\nIf a variable is not found anywhere, that's an error in strict mode (without `use strict`, an assignment to a non-existing variable creates a new global variable, for compatibility with old code).\n\nIn this example the search proceeds as follows:\n\n- For the `name` variable, the `alert` inside `say` finds it immediately in the inner Lexical Environment.\n- When it wants to access `phrase`, then there is no `phrase` locally, so it follows the reference to the outer Lexical Environment and finds it there.\n\n![lexical environment lookup](lexical-environment-simple-lookup.svg)\n\n\n### Step 4. Returning a function\n\nLet's return to the `makeCounter` example.\n\n```js\nfunction makeCounter() {\n  let count = 0;\n\n  return function() {\n    return count++;\n  };\n}\n\nlet counter = makeCounter();\n```\n\nAt the beginning of each `makeCounter()` call, a new Lexical Environment object is created, to store variables for this `makeCounter` run.\n\nSo we have two nested Lexical Environments, just like in the example above:\n\n![](closure-makecounter.svg)\n\nWhat's different is that, during the execution of `makeCounter()`, a tiny nested function is created of only one line: `return count++`. We don't run it yet, only create.\n\nAll functions remember the Lexical Environment in which they were made. Technically, there's no magic here: all functions have the hidden property named `[[Environment]]`, that keeps the reference to the Lexical Environment where the function was created:\n\n![](closure-makecounter-environment.svg)\n\nSo, `counter.[[Environment]]` has the reference to `{count: 0}` Lexical Environment. That's how the function remembers where it was created, no matter where it's called. The `[[Environment]]` reference is set once and forever at function creation time.\n\nLater, when `counter()` is called, a new Lexical Environment is created for the call, and its outer Lexical Environment reference is taken from `counter.[[Environment]]`:\n\n![](closure-makecounter-nested-call.svg)\n\nNow when the code inside `counter()` looks for `count` variable, it first searches its own Lexical Environment (empty, as there are no local variables there), then the Lexical Environment of the outer `makeCounter()` call, where finds it and changes.\n\n**A variable is updated in the Lexical Environment where it lives.**\n\nHere's the state after the execution:\n\n![](closure-makecounter-nested-call-2.svg)\n\nIf we call `counter()` multiple times, the `count` variable will be increased to `2`, `3` and so on, at the same place.\n\n```smart header=\"Closure\"\nThere is a general programming term \"closure\", that developers generally should know.\n\nA [closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)) is a function that remembers its outer variables and can access them. In some languages, that's not possible, or a function should be written in a special way to make it happen. But as explained above, in JavaScript, all functions are naturally closures (there is only one exception, to be covered in <info:new-function>).\n\nThat is: they automatically remember where they were created using a hidden `[[Environment]]` property, and then their code can access outer variables.\n\nWhen on an interview, a frontend developer gets a question about \"what's a closure?\", a valid answer would be a definition of the closure and an explanation that all functions in JavaScript are closures, and maybe a few more words about technical details: the `[[Environment]]` property and how Lexical Environments work.\n```\n\n## Garbage collection\n\nUsually, a Lexical Environment is removed from memory with all the variables after the function call finishes. That's because there are no references to it. As any JavaScript object, it's only kept in memory while it's reachable.\n\n...But if there's a nested function that is still reachable after the end of a function, then it has `[[Environment]]` property that references the lexical environment.\n\nIn that case the Lexical Environment is still reachable even after the completion of the function, so it stays alive.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nfunction f() {\n  let value = 123;\n\n  return function() {\n    alert(value);\n  }\n}\n\nlet g = f(); // g.[[Environment]] stores a reference to the Lexical Environment\n// of the corresponding f() call\n```\n\nPlease note that if `f()` is called many times, and resulting functions are saved, then all corresponding Lexical Environment objects will also be retained in memory. All 3 of them in the code below:\n\n```js\nfunction f() {\n  let value = Math.random();\n\n  return function() { alert(value); };\n}\n\n// 3 functions in array, every one of them links to Lexical Environment\n// from the corresponding f() run\nlet arr = [f(), f(), f()];\n```\n\nA Lexical Environment object dies when it becomes unreachable (just like any other object). In other words, it exists only while there's at least one nested function referencing it.\n\nIn the code below, after the nested function is removed, its enclosing Lexical Environment (and hence the `value`) is cleaned from memory:\n\n```js\nfunction f() {\n  let value = 123;\n\n  return function() {\n    alert(value);\n  }\n}\n\nlet g = f(); // while g function exists, the value stays in memory\n\ng = null; // ...and now the memory is cleaned up\n```\n\n### Real-life optimizations\n\nAs we've seen, in theory while a function is alive, all outer variables are also retained.\n\nBut in practice, JavaScript engines try to optimize that. They analyze variable usage and if it's obvious from the code that an outer variable is not used -- it is removed.\n\n**An important side effect in V8 (Chrome, Opera) is that such variable will become unavailable in debugging.**\n\nTry running the example below in Chrome with the Developer Tools open.\n\nWhen it pauses, in the console type `alert(value)`.\n\n```js run\nfunction f() {\n  let value = Math.random();\n\n  function g() {\n    debugger; // in console: type alert(value); No such variable!\n  }\n\n  return g;\n}\n\nlet g = f();\ng();\n```\n\nAs you could see -- there is no such variable! In theory, it should be accessible, but the engine optimized it out.\n\nThat may lead to funny (if not such time-consuming) debugging issues. One of them -- we can see a same-named outer variable instead of the expected one:\n\n```js run global\nlet value = \"Surprise!\";\n\nfunction f() {\n  let value = \"the closest value\";\n\n  function g() {\n    debugger; // in console: type alert(value); Surprise!\n  }\n\n  return g;\n}\n\nlet g = f();\ng();\n```\n\nThis feature of V8 is good to know. If you are debugging with Chrome/Opera, sooner or later you will meet it.\n\nThat is not a bug in the debugger, but rather a special feature of V8. Perhaps it will be changed sometime. You always can check for it by running the examples on this page.",

Fix the code so that they work as intended.",
        "solution": "Let's examine what's done inside `makeArmy`, and the solution will become obvious.\n\n1. It creates an empty array `shooters`:\n\n    ```js\n    let shooters = [];\n    ```\n2. Fills it in the loop via `shooters.push(function...)`.\n\n    Every element is a function, so the resulting array looks like this:\n\n    ```js no-beautify\n    shooters = [\n      function () { alert(i); },\n      function () { alert(i); },\n      function () { alert(i); },\n      function () { alert(i); },\n      function () { alert(i); },\n      function () { alert(i); },\n      function () { alert(i); },\n      function () { alert(i); },\n      function () { alert(i); },\n      function () { alert(i); }\n    ];\n    ```\n\n3. The array is returned from the function.\n\nThen, later, the call to `army[5]()` will get the element `army[5]` from the array (it will be a function) and call it.\n\nNow why all such functions show the same?\n\nThat's because there's no local variable `i` inside `shooter` functions. When such a function is called, it takes `i` from its outer lexical environment.\n\nWhat will be the value of `i`?\n\nIf we look at the source:\n\n```js\nfunction makeArmy() {\n  ...\n  let i = 0;\n  while (i < 10) {\n    let shooter = function() { // shooter function\n      alert( i ); // should show its number\n    };\n    ...\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n...We can see that it lives in the lexical environment associated with the current `makeArmy()` run. But when `army[5]()` is called, `makeArmy` has already finished its job, and `i` has the last value: `10` (the end of `while`).\n\nAs a result, all `shooter` functions get from the outer lexical envrironment the same, last value `i=10`.\n\nWe can fix it by moving the variable definition into the loop:\n\n```js run demo\nfunction makeArmy() {\n\n  let shooters = [];\n\n*!*\n  for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n*/!*\n    let shooter = function() { // shooter function\n      alert( i ); // should show its number\n    };\n    shooters.push(shooter);\n  }\n\n  return shooters;\n}\n\nlet army = makeArmy();\n\narmy[0](); // 0\narmy[5](); // 5\n```\n\nNow it works correctly, because every time the code block in `for (let i=0...) {...}` is executed, a new Lexical Environment is created for it, with the corresponding variable `i`.\n\nSo, the value of `i` now lives a little bit closer. Not in `makeArmy()` Lexical Environment, but in the Lexical Environment that corresponds the current loop iteration. That's why now it works.\n\n![](lexenv-makearmy.svg)\n\nHere we rewrote `while` into `for`.\n\nAnother trick could be possible, let's see it for better understanding of the subject:\n\n```js run\nfunction makeArmy() {\n  let shooters = [];\n\n  let i = 0;\n  while (i < 10) {\n*!*\n    let j = i;\n*/!*\n    let shooter = function() { // shooter function\n      alert( *!*j*/!* ); // should show its number\n    };\n    shooters.push(shooter);\n    i++;\n  }\n\n  return shooters;\n}\n\nlet army = makeArmy();\n\narmy[0](); // 0\narmy[5](); // 5\n```\n\nThe `while` loop, just like `for`, makes a new Lexical Environment for each run. So here we make sure that it gets the right value for a `shooter`.\n\nWe copy `let j = i`. This makes a loop body local `j` and copies the value of `i` to it. Primitives are copied \"by value\", so we actually get a complete independent copy of `i`, belonging to the current loop iteration.",

        "content": "\n\n```smart header=\"This article is for understanding old scripts\"\nThe information in this article is useful for understanding old scripts.\n\nThat's not how we write a new code.\n```\n\nIn the very first chapter about [variables](info:variables), we mentioned three ways of variable declaration:\n\n1. `let`\n2. `const`\n3. `var`\n\nThe `var` declaration is similar to `let`. Most of the time we can replace `let` by `var` or vice-versa and expect things to work:\n\n```js run\nvar message = \"Hi\";\nalert(message); // Hi\n```\n\nBut internally `var` is a very different beast, that originates from very old times. It's generally not used in modern scripts, but still lurks in the old ones.\n\nIf you don't plan on meeting such scripts you may even skip this chapter or postpone it.\n\nOn the other hand, it's important to understand differences when migrating old scripts from `var` to `let`, to avoid odd errors.\n\n## \"var\" has no block scope\n\nVariables, declared with `var`, are either function-wide or global. They are visible through blocks.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nif (true) {\n  var test = true; // use \"var\" instead of \"let\"\n}\n\n*!*\nalert(test); // true, the variable lives after if\n*/!*\n```\n\nAs `var` ignores code blocks, we've got a global variable `test`.\n\nIf we used `let test` instead of `var test`, then the variable would only be visible inside `if`:\n\n```js run\nif (true) {\n  let test = true; // use \"let\"\n}\n\n*!*\nalert(test); // Error: test is not defined\n*/!*\n```\n\nThe same thing for loops: `var` cannot be block- or loop-local:\n\n```js\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  // ...\n}\n\n*!*\nalert(i); // 10, \"i\" is visible after loop, it's a global variable\n*/!*\n```\n\nIf a code block is inside a function, then `var` becomes a function-level variable:\n\n```js run\nfunction sayHi() {\n  if (true) {\n    var phrase = \"Hello\";\n  }\n\n  alert(phrase); // works\n}\n\nsayHi();\nalert(phrase); // Error: phrase is not defined (Check the Developer Console)\n```\n\nAs we can see, `var` pierces through `if`, `for` or other code blocks. That's because a long time ago in JavaScript blocks had no Lexical Environments. And `var` is a remnant of that.\n\n## \"var\" tolerates redeclarations\n\nIf we declare the same variable with `let` twice in the same scope, that's an error:\n\n```js run\nlet user;\nlet user; // SyntaxError: 'user' has already been declared\n```\n\nWith `var`, we can redeclare a variable any number of times. If we use `var` with an already-declared variable, it's just ignored:\n\n```js run\nvar user = \"Pete\";\n\nvar user = \"John\"; // this \"var\" does nothing (already declared)\n// ...it doesn't trigger an error\n\nalert(user); // John\n```\n\n## \"var\" variables can be declared below their use\n\n`var` declarations are processed when the function starts (or script starts for globals).\n\nIn other words, `var` variables are defined from the beginning of the function, no matter where the definition is (assuming that the definition is not in the nested function).\n\nSo this code:\n\n```js run\nfunction sayHi() {\n  phrase = \"Hello\";\n\n  alert(phrase);\n\n*!*\n  var phrase;\n*/!*\n}\nsayHi();\n```\n\n...Is technically the same as this (moved `var phrase` above):\n\n```js run\nfunction sayHi() {\n*!*\n  var phrase;\n*/!*\n\n  phrase = \"Hello\";\n\n  alert(phrase);\n}\nsayHi();\n```\n\n...Or even as this (remember, code blocks are ignored):\n\n```js run\nfunction sayHi() {\n  phrase = \"Hello\"; // (*)\n\n  *!*\n  if (false) {\n    var phrase;\n  }\n  */!*\n\n  alert(phrase);\n}\nsayHi();\n```\n\nPeople also call such behavior \"hoisting\" (raising), because all `var` are \"hoisted\" (raised) to the top of the function.\n\nSo in the example above, `if (false)` branch never executes, but that doesn't matter. The `var` inside it is processed in the beginning of the function, so at the moment of `(*)` the variable exists.\n\n**Declarations are hoisted, but assignments are not.**\n\nThat's best demonstrated with an example:\n\n```js run\nfunction sayHi() {\n  alert(phrase);  \n\n*!*\n  var phrase = \"Hello\";\n*/!*\n}\n\nsayHi();\n```\n\nThe line `var phrase = \"Hello\"` has two actions in it:\n\n1. Variable declaration `var`\n2. Variable assignment `=`.\n\nThe declaration is processed at the start of function execution (\"hoisted\"), but the assignment always works at the place where it appears. So the code works essentially like this:\n\n```js run\nfunction sayHi() {\n*!*\n  var phrase; // declaration works at the start...\n*/!*\n\n  alert(phrase); // undefined\n\n*!*\n  phrase = \"Hello\"; // ...assignment - when the execution reaches it.\n*/!*\n}\n\nsayHi();\n```\n\nBecause all `var` declarations are processed at the function start, we can reference them at any place. But variables are undefined until the assignments.\n\nIn both examples above `alert` runs without an error, because the variable `phrase` exists. But its value is not yet assigned, so it shows `undefined`.\n\n### IIFE\n\nAs in the past there was only `var`, and it has no block-level visibility, programmers invented a way to emulate it. What they did was called \"immediately-invoked function expressions\" (abbreviated as IIFE).\n\nThat's not something we should use nowadays, but you can find them in old scripts.\n\nAn IIFE looks like this:\n\n```js run\n(function() {\n\n  let message = \"Hello\";\n\n  alert(message); // Hello\n\n})();\n```\n\nHere a Function Expression is created and immediately called. So the code executes right away and has its own private variables.\n\nThe Function Expression is wrapped with parenthesis `(function {...})`, because when JavaScript meets `\"function\"` in the main code flow, it understands it as the start of a Function Declaration. But a Function Declaration must have a name, so this kind of code will give an error:\n\n```js run\n// Try to declare and immediately call a function\nfunction() { // <-- Error: Function statements require a function name\n\n  let message = \"Hello\";\n\n  alert(message); // Hello\n\n}();\n```\n\nEven if we say: \"okay, let's add a name\", that won't work, as JavaScript does not allow Function Declarations to be called immediately:\n\n```js run\n// syntax error because of parentheses below\nfunction go() {\n\n}(); // <-- can't call Function Declaration immediately\n```\n\nSo, the parentheses around the function is a trick to show JavaScript that the function is created in the context of another expression, and hence it's a Function Expression: it needs no name and can be called immediately.\n\nThere exist other ways besides parentheses to tell JavaScript that we mean a Function Expression:\n\n```js run\n// Ways to create IIFE\n\n(function() {\n  alert(\"Parentheses around the function\");\n}*!*)*/!*();\n\n(function() {\n  alert(\"Parentheses around the whole thing\");\n}()*!*)*/!*;\n\n*!*!*/!*function() {\n  alert(\"Bitwise NOT operator starts the expression\");\n}();\n\n*!*+*/!*function() {\n  alert(\"Unary plus starts the expression\");\n}();\n```\n\nIn all the above cases we declare a Function Expression and run it immediately. Let's note again: nowadays there's no reason to write such code.\n\n## Summary\n\nThere are two main differences of `var` compared to `let/const`:\n\n1. `var` variables have no block scope, they are visible minimum at the function level.\n2. `var` declarations are processed at function start (script start for globals).\n\nThere's one more very minor difference related to the global object, that we'll cover in the next chapter.\n\nThese differences make `var` worse than `let` most of the time. Block-level variables is such a great thing. That's why `let` was introduced in the standard long ago, and is now a major way (along with `const`) to declare a variable.",

        "content": "\n\nThe global object provides variables and functions that are available anywhere. By default, those that are built into the language or the environment.\n\nIn a browser it is named `window`, for Node.js it is `global`, for other environments it may have another name.\n\nRecently, `globalThis` was added to the language, as a standardized name for a global object, that should be supported across all environments. In some browsers, namely non-Chromium Edge, `globalThis` is not yet supported, but can be easily polyfilled.\n\nWe'll use `window` here, assuming that our environment is a browser. If your script may run in other environments, it's better to use `globalThis` instead.\n\nAll properties of the global object can be accessed directly:\n\n```js run\nalert(\"Hello\");\n// is the same as\nwindow.alert(\"Hello\");\n```\n\nIn a browser, global functions and variables declared with `var` (not `let/const`!) become the property of the global object:\n\n```js run untrusted refresh\nvar gVar = 5;\n\nalert(window.gVar); // 5 (became a property of the global object)\n```\n\nPlease don't rely on that! This behavior exists for compatibility reasons. Modern scripts use [JavaScript modules](info:modules) where such thing doesn't happen.\n\nIf we used `let` instead, such thing wouldn't happen:\n\n```js run untrusted refresh\nlet gLet = 5;\n\nalert(window.gLet); // undefined (doesn't become a property of the global object)\n```\n\nIf a value is so important that you'd like to make it available globally, write it directly as a property:\n\n```js run\n*!*\n// make current user information global, to let all scripts access it\nwindow.currentUser = {\n  name: \"John\"\n};\n*/!*\n\n// somewhere else in code\nalert(currentUser.name);  // John\n\n// or, if we have a local variable with the name \"currentUser\"\n// get it from window explicitly (safe!)\nalert(window.currentUser.name); // John\n```\n\nThat said, using global variables is generally discouraged. There should be as few global variables as possible. The code design where a function gets \"input\" variables and produces certain \"outcome\" is clearer, less prone to errors and easier to test than if it uses outer or global variables.\n\n## Using for polyfills\n\nWe use the global object to test for support of modern language features.\n\nFor instance, test if a built-in `Promise` object exists (it doesn't in really old browsers):\n```js run\nif (!window.Promise) {\n  alert(\"Your browser is really old!\");\n}\n```\n\nIf there's none (say, we're in an old browser), we can create \"polyfills\": add functions that are not supported by the environment, but exist in the modern standard.\n\n```js run\nif (!window.Promise) {\n  window.Promise = ... // custom implementation of the modern language feature\n}\n```\n\n## Summary\n\n- The global object holds variables that should be available everywhere.\n\n    That includes JavaScript built-ins, such as `Array` and environment-specific values, such as `window.innerHeight` -- the window height in the browser.\n- The global object has a universal name `globalThis`.\n\n    ...But more often is referred by \"old-school\" environment-specific names, such as `window` (browser) and `global` (Node.js). As `globalThis` is a recent proposal, it's not supported in non-Chromium Edge (but can be polyfilled).\n- We should store values in the global object only if they're truly global for our project. And keep their number at minimum.\n- In-browser, unless we're using [modules](info:modules), global functions and variables declared with `var` become a property of the global object.\n- To make our code future-proof and easier to understand, we should access properties of the global object directly, as `window.x`.",

        "content": "\n\nAs we already know, a function in JavaScript is a value.\n\nEvery value in JavaScript has a type. What type is a function?\n\nIn JavaScript, functions are objects.\n\nA good way to imagine functions is as callable \"action objects\". We can not only call them, but also treat them as objects: add/remove properties, pass by reference etc.\n\n\n## The \"name\" property\n\nFunction objects contain some useable properties.\n\nFor instance, a function's name is accessible as the \"name\" property:\n\n```js run\nfunction sayHi() {\n  alert(\"Hi\");\n}\n\nalert(sayHi.name); // sayHi\n```\n\nWhat's kind of funny, the name-assigning logic is smart. It also assigns the correct name to a function even if it's created without one, and then immediately assigned:\n\n```js run\nlet sayHi = function() {\n  alert(\"Hi\");\n};\n\nalert(sayHi.name); // sayHi (there's a name!)\n```\n\nIt also works if the assignment is done via a default value:\n\n```js run\nfunction f(sayHi = function() {}) {\n  alert(sayHi.name); // sayHi (works!)\n}\n\nf();\n```\n\nIn the specification, this feature is called a \"contextual name\". If the function does not provide one, then in an assignment it is figured out from the context.\n\nObject methods have names too:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n\n  sayHi() {\n    // ...\n  },\n\n  sayBye: function() {\n    // ...\n  }\n\n}\n\nalert(user.sayHi.name); // sayHi\nalert(user.sayBye.name); // sayBye\n```\n\nThere's no magic though. There are cases when there's no way to figure out the right name. In that case, the name property is empty, like here:\n\n```js run\n// function created inside array\nlet arr = [function() {}];\n\nalert( arr[0].name ); // <empty string>\n// the engine has no way to set up the right name, so there is none\n```\n\nIn practice, however, most functions do have a name.\n\n## The \"length\" property\n\nThere is another built-in property \"length\" that returns the number of function parameters, for instance:\n\n```js run\nfunction f1(a) {}\nfunction f2(a, b) {}\nfunction many(a, b, ...more) {}\n\nalert(f1.length); // 1\nalert(f2.length); // 2\nalert(many.length); // 2\n```\n\nHere we can see that rest parameters are not counted.\n\nThe `length` property is sometimes used for [introspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_introspection) in functions that operate on other functions.\n\nFor instance, in the code below the `ask` function accepts a `question` to ask and an arbitrary number of `handler` functions to call.\n\nOnce a user provides their answer, the function calls the handlers. We can pass two kinds of handlers:\n\n- A zero-argument function, which is only called when the user gives a positive answer.\n- A function with arguments, which is called in either case and returns an answer.\n\nTo call `handler` the right way, we examine the `handler.length` property.\n\nThe idea is that we have a simple, no-arguments handler syntax for positive cases (most frequent variant), but are able to support universal handlers as well:\n\n```js run\nfunction ask(question, ...handlers) {\n  let isYes = confirm(question);\n\n  for(let handler of handlers) {\n    if (handler.length == 0) {\n      if (isYes) handler();\n    } else {\n      handler(isYes);\n    }\n  }\n\n}\n\n// for positive answer, both handlers are called\n// for negative answer, only the second one\nask(\"Question?\", () => alert('You said yes'), result => alert(result));\n```\n\nThis is a particular case of so-called [polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)) -- treating arguments differently depending on their type or, in our case depending on the `length`. The idea does have a use in JavaScript libraries.\n\n## Custom properties\n\nWe can also add properties of our own.\n\nHere we add the `counter` property to track the total calls count:\n\n```js run\nfunction sayHi() {\n  alert(\"Hi\");\n\n  *!*\n  // let's count how many times we run\n  sayHi.counter++;\n  */!*\n}\nsayHi.counter = 0; // initial value\n\nsayHi(); // Hi\nsayHi(); // Hi\n\nalert( `Called ${sayHi.counter} times` ); // Called 2 times\n```\n\n```warn header=\"A property is not a variable\"\nA property assigned to a function like `sayHi.counter = 0` does *not* define a local variable `counter` inside it. In other words, a property `counter` and a variable `let counter` are two unrelated things.\n\nWe can treat a function as an object, store properties in it, but that has no effect on its execution. Variables are not function properties and vice versa. These are just parallel worlds.\n```\n\nFunction properties can replace closures sometimes. For instance, we can rewrite the counter function example from the chapter <info:closure> to use a function property:\n\n```js run\nfunction makeCounter() {\n  // instead of:\n  // let count = 0\n\n  function counter() {\n    return counter.count++;\n  };\n\n  counter.count = 0;\n\n  return counter;\n}\n\nlet counter = makeCounter();\nalert( counter() ); // 0\nalert( counter() ); // 1\n```\n\nThe `count` is now stored in the function directly, not in its outer Lexical Environment.\n\nIs it better or worse than using a closure?\n\nThe main difference is that if the value of `count` lives in an outer variable, then external code is unable to access it. Only nested functions may modify it. And if it's bound to a function, then such a thing is possible:\n\n```js run\nfunction makeCounter() {\n\n  function counter() {\n    return counter.count++;\n  };\n\n  counter.count = 0;\n\n  return counter;\n}\n\nlet counter = makeCounter();\n\n*!*\ncounter.count = 10;\nalert( counter() ); // 10\n*/!*\n```\n\nSo the choice of implementation depends on our aims.\n\n## Named Function Expression\n\nNamed Function Expression, or NFE, is a term for Function Expressions that have a name.\n\nFor instance, let's take an ordinary Function Expression:\n\n```js\nlet sayHi = function(who) {\n  alert(`Hello, ${who}`);\n};\n```\n\nAnd add a name to it:\n\n```js\nlet sayHi = function *!*func*/!*(who) {\n  alert(`Hello, ${who}`);\n};\n```\n\nDid we achieve anything here? What's the purpose of that additional `\"func\"` name?\n\nFirst let's note, that we still have a Function Expression. Adding the name `\"func\"` after `function` did not make it a Function Declaration, because it is still created as a part of an assignment expression.\n\nAdding such a name also did not break anything.\n\nThe function is still available as `sayHi()`:\n\n```js run\nlet sayHi = function *!*func*/!*(who) {\n  alert(`Hello, ${who}`);\n};\n\nsayHi(\"John\"); // Hello, John\n```\n\nThere are two special things about the name `func`, that are the reasons for it:\n\n1. It allows the function to reference itself internally.\n2. It is not visible outside of the function.\n\nFor instance, the function `sayHi` below calls itself again with `\"Guest\"` if no `who` is provided:\n\n```js run\nlet sayHi = function *!*func*/!*(who) {\n  if (who) {\n    alert(`Hello, ${who}`);\n  } else {\n*!*\n    func(\"Guest\"); // use func to re-call itself\n*/!*\n  }\n};\n\nsayHi(); // Hello, Guest\n\n// But this won't work:\nfunc(); // Error, func is not defined (not visible outside of the function)\n```\n\nWhy do we use `func`? Maybe just use `sayHi` for the nested call?\n\n\nActually, in most cases we can:\n\n```js\nlet sayHi = function(who) {\n  if (who) {\n    alert(`Hello, ${who}`);\n  } else {\n*!*\n    sayHi(\"Guest\");\n*/!*\n  }\n};\n```\n\nThe problem with that code is that `sayHi` may change in the outer code. If the function gets assigned to another variable instead, the code will start to give errors:\n\n```js run\nlet sayHi = function(who) {\n  if (who) {\n    alert(`Hello, ${who}`);\n  } else {\n*!*\n    sayHi(\"Guest\"); // Error: sayHi is not a function\n*/!*\n  }\n};\n\nlet welcome = sayHi;\nsayHi = null;\n\nwelcome(); // Error, the nested sayHi call doesn't work any more!\n```\n\nThat happens because the function takes `sayHi` from its outer lexical environment. There's no local `sayHi`, so the outer variable is used. And at the moment of the call that outer `sayHi` is `null`.\n\nThe optional name which we can put into the Function Expression is meant to solve exactly these kinds of problems.\n\nLet's use it to fix our code:\n\n```js run\nlet sayHi = function *!*func*/!*(who) {\n  if (who) {\n    alert(`Hello, ${who}`);\n  } else {\n*!*\n    func(\"Guest\"); // Now all fine\n*/!*\n  }\n};\n\nlet welcome = sayHi;\nsayHi = null;\n\nwelcome(); // Hello, Guest (nested call works)\n```\n\nNow it works, because the name `\"func\"` is function-local. It is not taken from outside (and not visible there). The specification guarantees that it will always reference the current function.\n\nThe outer code still has it's variable `sayHi` or `welcome`. And `func` is an \"internal function name\", how the function can call itself internally.\n\n```smart header=\"There's no such thing for Function Declaration\"\nThe \"internal name\" feature described here is only available for Function Expressions, not for Function Declarations. For Function Declarations, there is no syntax for adding an \"internal\" name.\n\nSometimes, when we need a reliable internal name, it's the reason to rewrite a Function Declaration to Named Function Expression form.\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nFunctions are objects.\n\nHere we covered their properties:\n\n- `name` -- the function name. Usually taken from the function definition, but if there's none, JavaScript tries to guess it from the context (e.g. an assignment).\n- `length` -- the number of arguments in the function definition. Rest parameters are not counted.\n\nIf the function is declared as a Function Expression (not in the main code flow), and it carries the name, then it is called a Named Function Expression. The name can be used inside to reference itself, for recursive calls or such.\n\nAlso, functions may carry additional properties. Many well-known JavaScript libraries make great use of this feature.\n\nThey create a \"main\" function and attach many other \"helper\" functions to it.

Actually, they do it to lessen their pollution of the global space, so that a single library gives only one global variable.

        "content": "\n\nThere's one more way to create a function. It's rarely used, but sometimes there's no alternative.\n\n## Syntax\n\nThe syntax for creating a function:\n\n```js\nlet func = new Function ([arg1, arg2, ...argN], functionBody);\n```\n\nThe function is created with the arguments `arg1...argN` and the given `functionBody`.\n\nIt's easier to understand by looking at an example. Here's a function with two arguments:\n\n```js run\nlet sum = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b');\n\nalert( sum(1, 2) ); // 3\n```\n\nAnd here there's a function without arguments, with only the function body:\n\n```js run\nlet sayHi = new Function('alert(\"Hello\")');\n\nsayHi(); // Hello\n```\n\nThe major difference from other ways we've seen is that the function is created literally from a string, that is passed at run time.\n\nAll previous declarations required us, programmers, to write the function code in the script.\n\nBut `new Function` allows to turn any string into a function. For example, we can receive a new function from a server and then execute it:\n\n```js\nlet str = ... receive the code from a server dynamically ...\n\nlet func = new Function(str);\nfunc();\n```\n\nIt is used in very specific cases, like when we receive code from a server, or to dynamically compile a function from a template, in complex web-applications.\n\n## Closure\n\nUsually, a function remembers where it was born in the special property `[[Environment]]`. It references the Lexical Environment from where it's created  (we covered that in the chapter <info:closure>).\n\nBut when a function is created using `new Function`, its `[[Environment]]` is set to reference not the current Lexical Environment, but the global one.\n\nSo, such function doesn't have access to outer variables, only to the global ones.\n\n```js run\nfunction getFunc() {\n  let value = \"test\";\n\n*!*\n  let func = new Function('alert(value)');\n*/!*\n\n  return func;\n}\n\ngetFunc()(); // error: value is not defined\n```\n\nCompare it with the regular behavior:\n\n```js run\nfunction getFunc() {\n  let value = \"test\";\n\n*!*\n  let func = function() { alert(value); };\n*/!*\n\n  return func;\n}\n\ngetFunc()(); // *!*\"test\"*/!*, from the Lexical Environment of getFunc\n```\n\nThis special feature of `new Function` looks strange, but appears very useful in practice.\n\nImagine that we must create a function from a string. The code of that function is not known at the time of writing the script (that's why we don't use regular functions), but will be known in the process of execution. We may receive it from the server or from another source.\n\nOur new function needs to interact with the main script.\n\nWhat if it could access the outer variables?\n\nThe problem is that before JavaScript is published to production, it's compressed using a *minifier* -- a special program that shrinks code by removing extra comments, spaces and -- what's important, renames local variables into shorter ones.\n\nFor instance, if a function has `let userName`, minifier replaces it `let a` (or another letter if this one is occupied), and does it everywhere. That's usually a safe thing to do, because the variable is local, nothing outside the function can access it. And inside the function, minifier replaces every mention of it. Minifiers are smart, they analyze the code structure, so they don't break anything. They're not just a dumb find-and-replace.\n\nSo if `new Function` had access to outer variables, it would be unable to find renamed  `userName`.\n\n**If `new Function` had access to outer variables, it would have problems with minifiers.**\n\nBesides, such code would be architecturally bad and prone to errors.\n\nTo pass something to a function, created as `new Function`, we should use its arguments.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe syntax:\n\n```js\nlet func = new Function ([arg1, arg2, ...argN], functionBody);\n```\n\nFor historical reasons, arguments can also be given as a comma-separated list.\n\nThese three declarations mean the same:\n\n```js\nnew Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b'); // basic syntax\nnew Function('a,b', 'return a + b'); // comma-separated\nnew Function('a , b', 'return a + b'); // comma-separated with spaces\n```\n\nFunctions created with `new Function`, have `[[Environment]]` referencing the global Lexical Environment, not the outer one. Hence, they cannot use outer variables. But that's actually good, because it insures us from errors. Passing parameters explicitly is a much better method architecturally and causes no problems with minifiers.",

        "weight": 8,
        "content": "\n\nWe may decide to execute a function not right now, but at a certain time later. That's called \"scheduling a call\".\n\nThere are two methods for it:\n\n- `setTimeout` allows us to run a function once after the interval of time.\n- `setInterval` allows us to run a function repeatedly, starting after the interval of time, then repeating continuously at that interval.\n\nThese methods are not a part of JavaScript specification. But most environments have the internal scheduler and provide these methods. In particular, they are supported in all browsers and Node.js.\n\n## setTimeout\n\nThe syntax:\n\n```js\nlet timerId = setTimeout(func|code, [delay], [arg1], [arg2], ...)\n```\n\nParameters:\n\n`func|code`\n: Function or a string of code to execute.\nUsually, that's a function. For historical reasons, a string of code can be passed, but that's not recommended.\n\n`delay`\n: The delay before run, in milliseconds (1000 ms = 1 second), by default 0.\n\n`arg1`, `arg2`...\n: Arguments for the function (not supported in IE9-)\n\nFor instance, this code calls `sayHi()` after one second:\n\n```js run\nfunction sayHi() {\n  alert('Hello');\n}\n\n*!*\nsetTimeout(sayHi, 1000);\n*/!*\n```\n\nWith arguments:\n\n```js run\nfunction sayHi(phrase, who) {\n  alert( phrase + ', ' + who );\n}\n\n*!*\nsetTimeout(sayHi, 1000, \"Hello\", \"John\"); // Hello, John\n*/!*\n```\n\nIf the first argument is a string, then JavaScript creates a function from it.\n\nSo, this will also work:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nsetTimeout(\"alert('Hello')\", 1000);\n```\n\nBut using strings is not recommended, use arrow functions instead of them, like this:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nsetTimeout(() => alert('Hello'), 1000);\n```\n\n````smart header=\"Pass a function, but don't run it\"\nNovice developers sometimes make a mistake by adding brackets `()` after the function:\n\n```js\n// wrong!\nsetTimeout(sayHi(), 1000);\n```\nThat doesn't work, because `setTimeout` expects a reference to a function. And here `sayHi()` runs the function, and the *result of its execution* is passed to `setTimeout`. In our case the result of `sayHi()` is `undefined` (the function returns nothing), so nothing is scheduled.\n````\n\n### Canceling with clearTimeout\n\nA call to `setTimeout` returns a \"timer identifier\" `timerId` that we can use to cancel the execution.\n\nThe syntax to cancel:\n\n```js\nlet timerId = setTimeout(...);\nclearTimeout(timerId);\n```\n\nIn the code below, we schedule the function and then cancel it (changed our mind). As a result, nothing happens:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nlet timerId = setTimeout(() => alert(\"never happens\"), 1000);\nalert(timerId); // timer identifier\n\nclearTimeout(timerId);\nalert(timerId); // same identifier (doesn't become null after canceling)\n```\n\nAs we can see from `alert` output, in a browser the timer identifier is a number. In other environments, this can be something else. For instance, Node.js returns a timer object with additional methods.\n\nAgain, there is no universal specification for these methods, so that's fine.\n\nFor browsers, timers are described in the [timers section](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#timers) of HTML5 standard.\n\n## setInterval\n\nThe `setInterval` method has the same syntax as `setTimeout`:\n\n```js\nlet timerId = setInterval(func|code, [delay], [arg1], [arg2], ...)\n```\n\nAll arguments have the same meaning. But unlike `setTimeout` it runs the function not only once, but regularly after the given interval of time.\n\nTo stop further calls, we should call `clearInterval(timerId)`.\n\nThe following example will show the message every 2 seconds. After 5 seconds, the output is stopped:\n\n```js run\n// repeat with the interval of 2 seconds\nlet timerId = setInterval(() => alert('tick'), 2000);\n\n// after 5 seconds stop\nsetTimeout(() => { clearInterval(timerId); alert('stop'); }, 5000);\n```\n\n```smart header=\"Time goes on while `alert` is shown\"\nIn most browsers, including Chrome and Firefox the internal timer continues \"ticking\" while showing `alert/confirm/prompt`.\n\nSo if you run the code above and don't dismiss the `alert` window for some time, then in the next `alert` will be shown immediately as you do it. The actual interval between alerts will be shorter than 2 seconds.\n```\n\n## Nested setTimeout\n\nThere are two ways of running something regularly.\n\nOne is `setInterval`. The other one is a nested `setTimeout`, like this:\n\n```js\n/** instead of:\nlet timerId = setInterval(() => alert('tick'), 2000);\n*/\n\nlet timerId = setTimeout(function tick() {\n  alert('tick');\n*!*\n  timerId = setTimeout(tick, 2000); // (*)\n*/!*\n}, 2000);\n```\n\nThe `setTimeout` above schedules the next call right at the end of the current one `(*)`.\n\nThe nested `setTimeout` is a more flexible method than `setInterval`. This way the next call may be scheduled differently, depending on the results of the current one.\n\nFor instance, we need to write a service that sends a request to the server every 5 seconds asking for data, but in case the server is overloaded, it should increase the interval to 10, 20, 40 seconds...\n\nHere's the pseudocode:\n```js\nlet delay = 5000;\n\nlet timerId = setTimeout(function request() {\n  ...send request...\n\n  if (request failed due to server overload) {\n    // increase the interval to the next run\n    delay *= 2;\n  }\n\n  timerId = setTimeout(request, delay);\n\n}, delay);\n```\n\n\nAnd if the functions that we're scheduling are CPU-hungry, then we can measure the time taken by the execution and plan the next call sooner or later.\n\n**Nested `setTimeout` allows to set the delay between the executions more precisely than `setInterval`.**\n\nLet's compare two code fragments. The first one uses `setInterval`:\n\n```js\nlet i = 1;\nsetInterval(function() {\n  func(i++);\n}, 100);\n```\n\nThe second one uses nested `setTimeout`:\n\n```js\nlet i = 1;\nsetTimeout(function run() {\n  func(i++);\n  setTimeout(run, 100);\n}, 100);\n```\n\nFor `setInterval` the internal scheduler will run `func(i++)` every 100ms:\n\n![](setinterval-interval.svg)\n\nDid you notice?\n\n**The real delay between `func` calls for `setInterval` is less than in the code!**\n\nThat's normal, because the time taken by `func`'s execution \"consumes\" a part of the interval.\n\nIt is possible that `func`'s execution turns out to be longer than we expected and takes more than 100ms.\n\nIn this case the engine waits for `func` to complete, then checks the scheduler and if the time is up, runs it again *immediately*.\n\nIn the edge case, if the function always executes longer than `delay` ms, then the calls will happen without a pause at all.\n\nAnd here is the picture for the nested `setTimeout`:\n\n![](settimeout-interval.svg)\n\n**The nested `setTimeout` guarantees the fixed delay (here 100ms).**\n\nThat's because a new call is planned at the end of the previous one.\n\n````smart header=\"Garbage collection and setInterval/setTimeout callback\"\nWhen a function is passed in `setInterval/setTimeout`, an internal reference is created to it and saved in the scheduler. It prevents the function from being garbage collected, even if there are no other references to it.\n\n```js\n// the function stays in memory until the scheduler calls it\nsetTimeout(function() {...}, 100);\n```\n\nFor `setInterval` the function stays in memory until `clearInterval` is called.\n\nThere's a side-effect. A function references the outer lexical environment, so, while it lives, outer variables live too. They may take much more memory than the function itself. So when we don't need the scheduled function anymore, it's better to cancel it, even if it's very small.\n````\n\n## Zero delay setTimeout\n\nThere's a special use case: `setTimeout(func, 0)`, or just `setTimeout(func)`.\n\nThis schedules the execution of `func` as soon as possible. But the scheduler will invoke it only after the currently executing script is complete.\n\nSo the function is scheduled to run \"right after\" the current script.\n\nFor instance, this outputs \"Hello\", then immediately \"World\":\n\n```js run\nsetTimeout(() => alert(\"World\"));\n\nalert(\"Hello\");\n```\n\nThe first line \"puts the call into calendar after 0ms\". But the scheduler will only \"check the calendar\" after the current script is complete, so `\"Hello\"` is first, and `\"World\"` -- after it.\n\nThere are also advanced browser-related use cases of zero-delay timeout, that we'll discuss in the chapter <info:event-loop>.\n\n````smart header=\"Zero delay is in fact not zero (in a browser)\"\nIn the browser, there's a limitation of how often nested timers can run. The [HTML5 standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/timers-and-user-prompts.html#timers) says: \"after five nested timers, the interval is forced to be at least 4 milliseconds.\".\n\nLet's demonstrate what it means with the example below. The `setTimeout` call in it re-schedules itself with zero delay. Each call remembers the real time from the previous one in the `times` array. What do the real delays look like? Let's see:\n\n```js run\nlet start = Date.now();\nlet times = [];\n\nsetTimeout(function run() {\n  times.push(Date.now() - start); // remember delay from the previous call\n\n  if (start + 100 < Date.now()) alert(times); // show the delays after 100ms\n  else setTimeout(run); // else re-schedule\n});\n\n// an example of the output:\n// 1,1,1,1,9,15,20,24,30,35,40,45,50,55,59,64,70,75,80,85,90,95,100\n```\n\nFirst timers run immediately (just as written in the spec), and then we see `9, 15, 20, 24...`. The 4+ ms obligatory delay between invocations comes into play.\n\nThe similar thing happens if we use `setInterval` instead of `setTimeout`: `setInterval(f)` runs `f` few times with zero-delay, and afterwards with 4+ ms delay.\n\nThat limitation comes from ancient times and many scripts rely on it, so it exists for historical reasons.\n\nFor server-side JavaScript, that limitation does not exist, and there exist other ways to schedule an immediate asynchronous job, like [setImmediate](https://nodejs.org/api/timers.html) for Node.js. So this note is browser-specific.\n````\n\n## Summary\n\n- Methods `setTimeout(func, delay, ...args)` and `setInterval(func, delay, ...args)` allow us to run the `func` once/regularly after `delay` milliseconds.\n- To cancel the execution, we should call `clearTimeout/clearInterval` with the value returned by `setTimeout/setInterval`.\n- Nested `setTimeout` calls are a more flexible alternative to `setInterval`, allowing us to set the time *between* executions more precisely.\n- Zero delay scheduling with `setTimeout(func, 0)` (the same as `setTimeout(func)`) is used to schedule the call \"as soon as possible, but after the current script is complete\".\n- The browser limits the minimal delay for five or more nested call of `setTimeout` or for `setInterval` (after 5th call) to 4ms. That's for historical reasons.\n\nPlease note that all scheduling methods do not *guarantee* the exact delay.\n\nFor example, the in-browser timer may slow down for a lot of reasons:\n- The CPU is overloaded.\n- The browser tab is in the background mode.\n- The laptop is on battery.\n\nAll that may increase the minimal timer resolution (the minimal delay) to 300ms or even 1000ms depending on the browser and OS-level performance settings.",

They can be passed around, used as objects, and now we'll see how to *forward* calls between them and *decorate* them.\n\n## Transparent caching\n\nLet's say we have a function `slow(x)` which is CPU-heavy, but its results are stable. In other words, for the same `x` it always returns the same result.\n\nIf the function is called often, we may want to cache (remember) the results to avoid spending extra-time on recalculations.\n\nBut instead of adding that functionality into `slow()` we'll create a wrapper function, that adds caching. As we'll see, there are many benefits of doing so.\n\nHere's the code, and explanations follow:\n\n```js run\nfunction slow(x) {\n  // there can be a heavy CPU-intensive job here\n  alert(`Called with ${x}`);\n  return x;\n}\n\nfunction cachingDecorator(func) {\n  let cache = new Map();\n\n  return function(x) {\n    if (cache.has(x)) {    // if there's such key in cache\n      return cache.get(x); // read the result from it\n    }\n\n    let result = func(x);  // otherwise call func\n\n    cache.set(x, result);  // and cache (remember) the result\n    return result;\n  };\n}\n\nslow = cachingDecorator(slow);\n\nalert( slow(1) ); // slow(1) is cached\nalert( \"Again: \" + slow(1) ); // the same\n\nalert( slow(2) ); // slow(2) is cached\nalert( \"Again: \" + slow(2) ); // the same as the previous line\n```\n\nIn the code above `cachingDecorator` is a *decorator*: a special function that takes another function and alters its behavior.\n\nThe idea is that we can call `cachingDecorator` for any function, and it will return the caching wrapper. That's great, because we can have many functions that could use such a feature, and all we need to do is to apply `cachingDecorator` to them.\n\nBy separating caching from the main function code we also keep the main code simpler.\n\nThe result of `cachingDecorator(func)` is a \"wrapper\": `function(x)` that \"wraps\" the call of `func(x)` into caching logic:\n\n![](decorator-makecaching-wrapper.svg)\n\nFrom an outside code, the wrapped `slow` function still does the same. It just got a caching aspect added to its behavior.\n\nTo summarize, there are several benefits of using a separate `cachingDecorator` instead of altering the code of `slow` itself:\n\n- The `cachingDecorator` is reusable. We can apply it to another function.\n- The caching logic is separate, it did not increase the complexity of `slow` itself (if there was any).\n- We can combine multiple decorators if needed (other decorators will follow).\n\n## Using \"func.call\" for the context\n\nThe caching decorator mentioned above is not suited to work with object methods.\n\nFor instance, in the code below `worker.slow()` stops working after the decoration:\n\n```js run\n// we'll make worker.slow caching\nlet worker = {\n  someMethod() {\n    return 1;\n  },\n\n  slow(x) {\n    // scary CPU-heavy task here  \n    alert(\"Called with \" + x);\n    return x * this.someMethod(); // (*)\n  }\n};\n\n// same code as before\nfunction cachingDecorator(func) {\n  let cache = new Map();\n  return function(x) {\n    if (cache.has(x)) {\n      return cache.get(x);\n    }\n*!*\n    let result = func(x); // (**)\n*/!*\n    cache.set(x, result);\n    return result;\n  };\n}\n\nalert( worker.slow(1) ); // the original method works\n\nworker.slow = cachingDecorator(worker.slow); // now make it caching\n\n*!*\nalert( worker.slow(2) ); // Whoops! Error: Cannot read property 'someMethod' of undefined\n*/!*\n```\n\nThe error occurs in the line `(*)` that tries to access `this.someMethod` and fails. Can you see why?\n\nThe reason is that the wrapper calls the original function as `func(x)` in the line `(**)`. And, when called like that, the function gets `this = undefined`.\n\nWe would observe a similar symptom if we tried to run:\n\n```js\nlet func = worker.slow;\nfunc(2);\n```\n\nSo, the wrapper passes the call to the original method, but without the context `this`. Hence the error.\n\nLet's fix it.\n\nThere's a special built-in function method [func.call(context, ...args)](mdn:js/Function/call) that allows to call a function explicitly setting `this`.\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\nfunc.call(context, arg1, arg2, ...)\n```\n\nIt runs `func` providing the first argument as `this`, and the next as the arguments.\n\nTo put it simply, these two calls do almost the same:\n```js\nfunc(1, 2, 3);\nfunc.call(obj, 1, 2, 3)\n```\n\nThey both call `func` with arguments `1`, `2` and `3`. The only difference is that `func.call` also sets `this` to `obj`.\n\nAs an example, in the code below we call `sayHi` in the context of different objects: `sayHi.call(user)` runs `sayHi` providing `this=user`, and the next line sets `this=admin`:\n\n```js run\nfunction sayHi() {\n  alert(this.name);\n}\n\nlet user = { name: \"John\" };\nlet admin = { name: \"Admin\" };\n\n// use call to pass different objects as \"this\"\nsayHi.call( user ); // John\nsayHi.call( admin ); // Admin\n```\n\nAnd here we use `call` to call `say` with the given context and phrase:\n\n\n```js run\nfunction say(phrase) {\n  alert(this.name + ': ' + phrase);\n}\n\nlet user = { name: \"John\" };\n\n// user becomes this, and \"Hello\" becomes the first argument\nsay.call( user, \"Hello\" ); // John: Hello\n```\n\nIn our case, we can use `call` in the wrapper to pass the context to the original function:\n\n```js run\nlet worker = {\n  someMethod() {\n    return 1;\n  },\n\n  slow(x) {\n    alert(\"Called with \" + x);\n    return x * this.someMethod(); // (*)\n  }\n};\n\nfunction cachingDecorator(func) {\n  let cache = new Map();\n  return function(x) {\n    if (cache.has(x)) {\n      return cache.get(x);\n    }\n*!*\n    let result = func.call(this, x); // \"this\" is passed correctly now\n*/!*\n    cache.set(x, result);\n    return result;\n  };\n}\n\nworker.slow = cachingDecorator(worker.slow); // now make it caching\n\nalert( worker.slow(2) ); // works\nalert( worker.slow(2) ); // works, doesn't call the original (cached)\n```\n\nNow everything is fine.\n\nTo make it all clear, let's see more deeply how `this` is passed along:\n\n1. After the decoration `worker.slow` is now the wrapper `function (x) { ... }`.\n2. So when `worker.slow(2)` is executed, the wrapper gets `2` as an argument and `this=worker` (it's the object before dot).\n3. Inside the wrapper, assuming the result is not yet cached, `func.call(this, x)` passes the current `this` (`=worker`) and the current argument (`=2`) to the original method.\n\n## Going multi-argument\n\nNow let's make `cachingDecorator` even more universal. Till now it was working only with single-argument functions.\n\nNow how to cache the multi-argument `worker.slow` method?\n\n```js\nlet worker = {\n  slow(min, max) {\n    return min + max; // scary CPU-hogger is assumed\n  }\n};\n\n// should remember same-argument calls\nworker.slow = cachingDecorator(worker.slow);\n```\n\nPreviously, for a single argument `x` we could just `cache.set(x, result)` to save the result and `cache.get(x)` to retrieve it. But now we need to remember the result for a *combination of arguments* `(min,max)`. The native `Map` takes single value only as the key.\n\nThere are many solutions possible:\n\n1. Implement a new (or use a third-party) map-like data structure that is more versatile and allows multi-keys.\n2. Use nested maps: `cache.set(min)` will be a `Map` that stores the pair `(max, result)`. So we can get `result` as `cache.get(min).get(max)`.\n3. Join two values into one. In our particular case we can just use a string `\"min,max\"` as the `Map` key. For flexibility, we can allow to provide a *hashing function* for the decorator, that knows how to make one value from many.\n\nFor many practical applications, the 3rd variant is good enough, so we'll stick to it.\n\nAlso we need to pass not just `x`, but all arguments in `func.call`. Let's recall that in a `function()` we can get a pseudo-array of its arguments as `arguments`, so `func.call(this, x)` should be replaced with `func.call(this, ...arguments)`.\n\nHere's a more powerful `cachingDecorator`:\n\n```js run\nlet worker = {\n  slow(min, max) {\n    alert(`Called with ${min},${max}`);\n    return min + max;\n  }\n};\n\nfunction cachingDecorator(func, hash) {\n  let cache = new Map();\n  return function() {\n*!*\n    let key = hash(arguments); // (*)\n*/!*\n    if (cache.has(key)) {\n      return cache.get(key);\n    }\n\n*!*\n    let result = func.call(this, ...arguments); // (**)\n*/!*\n\n    cache.set(key, result);\n    return result;\n  };\n}\n\nfunction hash(args) {\n  return args[0] + ',' + args[1];\n}\n\nworker.slow = cachingDecorator(worker.slow, hash);\n\nalert( worker.slow(3, 5) ); // works\nalert( \"Again \" + worker.slow(3, 5) ); // same (cached)\n```\n\nNow it works with any number of arguments (though the hash function would also need to be adjusted to allow any number of arguments. An interesting way to handle this will be covered below).\n\nThere are two changes:\n\n- In the line `(*)` it calls `hash` to create a single key from `arguments`. Here we use a simple \"joining\" function that turns arguments `(3, 5)` into the key `\"3,5\"`. More complex cases may require other hashing functions.\n- Then `(**)` uses `func.call(this, ...arguments)` to pass both the context and all arguments the wrapper got (not just the first one) to the original function.\n\n## func.apply\n\nInstead of `func.call(this, ...arguments)` we could use `func.apply(this, arguments)`.\n\nThe syntax of built-in method [func.apply](mdn:js/Function/apply) is:\n\n```js\nfunc.apply(context, args)\n```\n\nIt runs the `func` setting `this=context` and using an array-like object `args` as the list of arguments.\n\nThe only syntax difference between `call` and `apply` is that `call` expects a list of arguments, while `apply` takes an array-like object with them.\n\nSo these two calls are almost equivalent:\n\n```js\nfunc.call(context, ...args); // pass an array as list with spread syntax\nfunc.apply(context, args);   // is same as using call\n```\n\nThere's only a subtle difference:\n\n- The spread syntax `...` allows to pass *iterable* `args` as the list to `call`.\n- The `apply` accepts only *array-like* `args`.\n\nSo, where we expect an iterable, `call` works, and where we expect an array-like, `apply` works.\n\nAnd for objects that are both iterable and array-like, like a real array, we can use any of them, but `apply` will probably be faster, because most JavaScript engines internally optimize it better.\n\nPassing all arguments along with the context to another function is called *call forwarding*.\n\nThat's the simplest form of it:\n\n```js\nlet wrapper = function() {\n  return func.apply(this, arguments);\n};\n```\n\nWhen an external code calls such `wrapper`, it is indistinguishable from the call of the original function `func`.\n\n## Borrowing a method [#method-borrowing]\n\nNow let's make one more minor improvement in the hashing function:\n\n```js\nfunction hash(args) {\n  return args[0] + ',' + args[1];\n}\n```\n\nAs of now, it works only on two arguments. It would be better if it could glue any number of `args`.\n\nThe natural solution would be to use [arr.join](mdn:js/Array/join) method:\n\n```js\nfunction hash(args) {\n  return args.join();\n}\n```\n\n...Unfortunately, that won't work. Because we are calling `hash(arguments)`, and `arguments` object is both iterable and array-like, but not a real array.\n\nSo calling `join` on it would fail, as we can see below:\n\n```js run\nfunction hash() {\n*!*\n  alert( arguments.join() ); // Error: arguments.join is not a function\n*/!*\n}\n\nhash(1, 2);\n```\n\nStill, there's an easy way to use array join:\n\n```js run\nfunction hash() {\n*!*\n  alert( [].join.call(arguments) ); // 1,2\n*/!*\n}\n\nhash(1, 2);\n```\n\nThe trick is called *method borrowing*.\n\nWe take (borrow) a join method from a regular array (`[].join`) and use `[].join.call` to run it in the context of `arguments`.\n\nWhy does it work?\n\nThat's because the internal algorithm of the native method `arr.join(glue)` is very simple.\n\nTaken from the specification almost \"as-is\":\n\n1. Let `glue` be the first argument or, if no arguments, then a comma `\",\"`.\n2. Let `result` be an empty string.\n3. Append `this[0]` to `result`.\n4. Append `glue` and `this[1]`.\n5. Append `glue` and `this[2]`.\n6. ...Do so until `this.length` items are glued.\n7. Return `result`.\n\nSo, technically it takes `this` and joins `this[0]`, `this[1]` ...etc together. It's intentionally written in a way that allows any array-like `this` (not a coincidence, many methods follow this practice). That's why it also works with `this=arguments`.\n\n## Decorators and function properties\n\nIt is generally safe to replace a function or a method with a decorated one, except for one little thing. If the original function had properties on it, like `func.calledCount` or whatever, then the decorated one will not provide them. Because that is a wrapper. So one needs to be careful if one uses them.\n\nE.g. in the example above if `slow` function had any properties on it, then `cachingDecorator(slow)` is a wrapper without them.\n\nSome decorators may provide their own properties. E.g. a decorator may count how many times a function was invoked and how much time it took, and expose this information via wrapper properties.\n\nThere exists a way to create decorators that keep access to function properties, but this requires using a special `Proxy` object to wrap a function. We'll discuss it later in the article <info:proxy#proxy-apply>.\n\n## Summary\n\n*Decorator* is a wrapper around a function that alters its behavior. The main job is still carried out by the function.\n\nDecorators can be seen as \"features\" or \"aspects\" that can be added to a function. We can add one or add many. And all this without changing its code!\n\nTo implement `cachingDecorator`, we studied methods:\n\n- [func.call(context, arg1, arg2...)](mdn:js/Function/call) -- calls `func` with given context and arguments.\n- [func.apply(context, args)](mdn:js/Function/apply) -- calls `func` passing `context` as `this` and array-like `args` into a list of arguments.\n\nThe generic *call forwarding* is usually done with `apply`:\n\n```js\nlet wrapper = function() {\n  return original.apply(this, arguments);\n};\n```\n\nWe also saw an example of *method borrowing* when we take a method from an object and `call` it in the context of another object. It is quite common to take array methods and apply them to `arguments`. The alternative is to use rest parameters object that is a real array.\n\nThere are many decorators there in the wild.

Good for processing the final result.\n- `throttle` runs it not more often than given `ms` time. Good for regular updates that shouldn't be very often.\n\nLet's check the real-life application to better understand that requirement and to see where it comes from.\n\n**For instance, we want to track mouse movements.**\n\nIn a browser we can setup a function to run at every mouse movement and get the pointer location as it moves. During an active mouse usage, this function usually runs very frequently, can be something like 100 times per second (every 10 ms).\n**We'd like to update some information on the web-page when the pointer moves.**\n\n...But updating function `update()` is too heavy to do it on every micro-movement. There is also no sense in updating more often than once per 100ms.\n\nSo we'll wrap it into the decorator: use `throttle(update, 100)` as the function to run on each mouse move instead of the original `update()`. The decorator will be called often, but forward the call to `update()` at maximum once per 100ms.\n\nVisually, it will look like this:\n\n1. For the first mouse movement the decorated variant immediately passes the call to `update`. That's important, the user sees our reaction to their move immediately.\n2. Then as the mouse moves on, until `100ms` nothing happens. The decorated variant ignores calls.\n3. At the end of `100ms` -- one more `update` happens with the last coordinates.\n4. Then, finally, the mouse stops somewhere. The decorated variant waits until `100ms` expire and then runs `update` with last coordinates.

        "solution": "```js demo\nfunction throttle(func, ms) {\n\n  let isThrottled = false,\n    savedArgs,\n    savedThis;\n\n  function wrapper() {\n\n    if (isThrottled) { // (2)\n      savedArgs = arguments;\n      savedThis = this;\n      return;\n    }\n\n    func.apply(this, arguments); // (1)\n\n    isThrottled = true;\n\n    setTimeout(function() {\n      isThrottled = false; // (3)\n      if (savedArgs) {\n        wrapper.apply(savedThis, savedArgs);\n        savedArgs = savedThis = null;\n      }\n    }, ms);\n  }\n\n  return wrapper;\n}\n```\n\nA call to `throttle(func, ms)` returns `wrapper`.\n\n1.

        "content": "\n\nWhen passing object methods as callbacks, for instance to `setTimeout`, there's a known problem: \"losing `this`\".\n\nIn this chapter we'll see the ways to fix it.\n\n## Losing \"this\"\n\nWe've already seen examples of losing `this`. Once a method is passed somewhere separately from the object -- `this` is lost.\n\nHere's how it may happen with `setTimeout`:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  firstName: \"John\",\n  sayHi() {\n    alert(`Hello, ${this.firstName}!`);\n  }\n};\n\n*!*\nsetTimeout(user.sayHi, 1000); // Hello, undefined!\n*/!*\n```\n\nAs we can see, the output shows not \"John\" as `this.firstName`, but `undefined`!\n\nThat's because `setTimeout` got the function `user.sayHi`, separately from the object. The last line can be rewritten as:\n\n```js\nlet f = user.sayHi;\nsetTimeout(f, 1000); // lost user context\n```\n\nThe method `setTimeout` in-browser is a little special: it sets `this=window` for the function call (for Node.js, `this` becomes the timer object, but doesn't really matter here). So for `this.firstName` it tries to get `window.firstName`, which does not exist. In other similar cases, usually `this` just becomes `undefined`.\n\nThe task is quite typical -- we want to pass an object method somewhere else (here -- to the scheduler) where it will be called. How to make sure that it will be called in the right context?\n\n## Solution 1: a wrapper\n\nThe simplest solution is to use a wrapping function:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  firstName: \"John\",\n  sayHi() {\n    alert(`Hello, ${this.firstName}!`);\n  }\n};\n\n*!*\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  user.sayHi(); // Hello, John!\n}, 1000);\n*/!*\n```\n\nNow it works, because it receives `user` from the outer lexical environment, and then calls the method normally.\n\nThe same, but shorter:\n\n```js\nsetTimeout(() => user.sayHi(), 1000); // Hello, John!\n```\n\nLooks fine, but a slight vulnerability appears in our code structure.\n\nWhat if before `setTimeout` triggers (there's one second delay!) `user` changes value? Then, suddenly, it will call the wrong object!\n\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  firstName: \"John\",\n  sayHi() {\n    alert(`Hello, ${this.firstName}!`);\n  }\n};\n\nsetTimeout(() => user.sayHi(), 1000);\n\n// ...the value of user changes within 1 second\nuser = {\n  sayHi() { alert(\"Another user in setTimeout!\"); }\n};\n\n// Another user in setTimeout!\n```\n\nThe next solution guarantees that such thing won't happen.\n\n## Solution 2: bind\n\nFunctions provide a built-in method [bind](mdn:js/Function/bind) that allows to fix `this`.\n\nThe basic syntax is:\n\n```js\n// more complex syntax will come a little later\nlet boundFunc = func.bind(context);\n```\n\nThe result of `func.bind(context)` is a special function-like \"exotic object\", that is callable as function and transparently passes the call to `func` setting `this=context`.\n\nIn other words, calling `boundFunc` is like `func` with fixed `this`.\n\nFor instance, here `funcUser` passes a call to `func` with `this=user`:\n\n```js run  \nlet user = {\n  firstName: \"John\"\n};\n\nfunction func() {\n  alert(this.firstName);\n}\n\n*!*\nlet funcUser = func.bind(user);\nfuncUser(); // John  \n*/!*\n```\n\nHere `func.bind(user)` as a \"bound variant\" of `func`, with fixed `this=user`.\n\nAll arguments are passed to the original `func` \"as is\", for instance:\n\n```js run  \nlet user = {\n  firstName: \"John\"\n};\n\nfunction func(phrase) {\n  alert(phrase + ', ' + this.firstName);\n}\n\n// bind this to user\nlet funcUser = func.bind(user);\n\n*!*\nfuncUser(\"Hello\"); // Hello, John (argument \"Hello\" is passed, and this=user)\n*/!*\n```\n\nNow let's try with an object method:\n\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  firstName: \"John\",\n  sayHi() {\n    alert(`Hello, ${this.firstName}!`);\n  }\n};\n\n*!*\nlet sayHi = user.sayHi.bind(user); // (*)\n*/!*\n\n// can run it without an object\nsayHi(); // Hello, John!\n\nsetTimeout(sayHi, 1000); // Hello, John!\n\n// even if the value of user changes within 1 second\n// sayHi uses the pre-bound value\nuser = {\n  sayHi() { alert(\"Another user in setTimeout!\"); }\n};\n```\n\nIn the line `(*)` we take the method `user.sayHi` and bind it to `user`. The `sayHi` is a \"bound\" function, that can be called alone or passed to `setTimeout` -- doesn't matter, the context will be right.\n\nHere we can see that arguments are passed \"as is\", only `this` is fixed by `bind`:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  firstName: \"John\",\n  say(phrase) {\n    alert(`${phrase}, ${this.firstName}!`);\n  }\n};\n\nlet say = user.say.bind(user);\n\nsay(\"Hello\"); // Hello, John (\"Hello\" argument is passed to say)\nsay(\"Bye\"); // Bye, John (\"Bye\" is passed to say)\n```\n\n````smart header=\"Convenience method: `bindAll`\"\nIf an object has many methods and we plan to actively pass it around, then we could bind them all in a loop:\n\n```js\nfor (let key in user) {\n  if (typeof user[key] == 'function') {\n    user[key] = user[key].bind(user);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nJavaScript libraries also provide functions for convenient mass binding , e.g. [_.bindAll(obj)](http://lodash.com/docs#bindAll) in lodash.\n````\n\n## Partial functions\n\nUntil now we have only been talking about binding `this`. Let's take it a step further.\n\nWe can bind not only `this`, but also arguments. That's rarely done, but sometimes can be handy.\n\nThe full syntax of `bind`:\n\n```js\nlet bound = func.bind(context, [arg1], [arg2], ...);\n```\n\nIt allows to bind context as `this` and starting arguments of the function.\n\nFor instance, we have a multiplication function `mul(a, b)`:\n\n```js\nfunction mul(a, b) {\n  return a * b;\n}\n```\n\nLet's use `bind` to create a function `double` on its base:\n\n```js run\nfunction mul(a, b) {\n  return a * b;\n}\n\n*!*\nlet double = mul.bind(null, 2);\n*/!*\n\nalert( double(3) ); // = mul(2, 3) = 6\nalert( double(4) ); // = mul(2, 4) = 8\nalert( double(5) ); // = mul(2, 5) = 10\n```\n\nThe call to `mul.bind(null, 2)` creates a new function `double` that passes calls to `mul`, fixing `null` as the context and `2` as the first argument. Further arguments are passed \"as is\".\n\nThat's called [partial function application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application) -- we create a new function by fixing some parameters of the existing one.\n\nPlease note that here we actually don't use `this` here. But `bind` requires it, so we must put in something like `null`.\n\nThe function `triple` in the code below triples the value:\n\n```js run\nfunction mul(a, b) {\n  return a * b;\n}\n\n*!*\nlet triple = mul.bind(null, 3);\n*/!*\n\nalert( triple(3) ); // = mul(3, 3) = 9\nalert( triple(4) ); // = mul(3, 4) = 12\nalert( triple(5) ); // = mul(3, 5) = 15\n```\n\nWhy do we usually make a partial function?\n\nThe benefit is that we can create an independent function with a readable name (`double`, `triple`). We can use it and not provide the first argument every time as it's fixed with `bind`.\n\nIn other cases, partial application is useful when we have a very generic function and want a less universal variant of it for convenience.\n\nFor instance, we have a function `send(from, to, text)`. Then, inside a `user` object we may want to use a partial variant of it: `sendTo(to, text)` that sends from the current user.\n\n## Going partial without context\n\nWhat if we'd like to fix some arguments, but not the context `this`? For example, for an object method.\n\nThe native `bind` does not allow that. We can't just omit the context and jump to arguments.\n\nFortunately, a function `partial` for binding only arguments can be easily implemented.\n\nLike this:\n\n```js run\n*!*\nfunction partial(func, ...argsBound) {\n  return function(...args) { // (*)\n    return func.call(this, ...argsBound, ...args);\n  }\n}\n*/!*\n\n// Usage:\nlet user = {\n  firstName: \"John\",\n  say(time, phrase) {\n    alert(`[${time}] ${this.firstName}: ${phrase}!`);\n  }\n};\n\n// add a partial method with fixed time\nuser.sayNow = partial(user.say, new Date().getHours() + ':' + new Date().getMinutes());\n\nuser.sayNow(\"Hello\");\n// Something like:\n// [10:00] John: Hello!\n```\n\nThe result of `partial(func[, arg1, arg2...])` call is a wrapper `(*)` that calls `func` with:\n- Same `this` as it gets (for `user.sayNow` call it's `user`)\n- Then gives it `...argsBound` -- arguments from the `partial` call (`\"10:00\"`)\n- Then gives it `...args` -- arguments given to the wrapper (`\"Hello\"`)\n\nSo easy to do it with the spread syntax, right?\n\nAlso there's a ready [_.partial](https://lodash.com/docs#partial) implementation from lodash library.\n\n## Summary\n\nMethod `func.bind(context, ...args)` returns a \"bound variant\" of function `func` that fixes the context `this` and first arguments if given.\n\nUsually we apply `bind` to fix `this` for an object method, so that we can pass it somewhere. For example, to `setTimeout`.\n\nWhen we fix some arguments of an existing function, the resulting (less universal) function is called *partially applied* or *partial*.\n\nPartials are convenient when we don't want to repeat the same argument over and over again. Like if we have a `send(from, to)` function, and `from` should always be the same for our task, we can get a partial and go on with it.",

        "content": "\n\nLet's revisit arrow functions.\n\nArrow functions are not just a \"shorthand\" for writing small stuff. They have some very specific and useful features.\n\nJavaScript is full of situations where we need to write a small function that's executed somewhere else.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- `arr.forEach(func)` -- `func` is executed by `forEach` for every array item.\n- `setTimeout(func)` -- `func` is executed by the built-in scheduler.\n- ...there are more.\n\nIt's in the very spirit of JavaScript to create a function and pass it somewhere.\n\nAnd in such functions we usually don't want to leave the current context. That's where arrow functions come in handy.\n\n## Arrow functions have no \"this\"\n\nAs we remember from the chapter <info:object-methods>, arrow functions do not have `this`. If `this` is accessed, it is taken from the outside.\n\nFor instance, we can use it to iterate inside an object method:\n\n```js run\nlet group = {\n  title: \"Our Group\",\n  students: [\"John\", \"Pete\", \"Alice\"],\n\n  showList() {\n*!*\n    this.students.forEach(\n      student => alert(this.title + ': ' + student)\n    );\n*/!*\n  }\n};\n\ngroup.showList();\n```\n\nHere in `forEach`, the arrow function is used, so `this.title` in it is exactly the same as in the outer method `showList`. That is: `group.title`.\n\nIf we used a \"regular\" function, there would be an error:\n\n```js run\nlet group = {\n  title: \"Our Group\",\n  students: [\"John\", \"Pete\", \"Alice\"],\n\n  showList() {\n*!*\n    this.students.forEach(function(student) {\n      // Error: Cannot read property 'title' of undefined\n      alert(this.title + ': ' + student)\n    });\n*/!*\n  }\n};\n\ngroup.showList();\n```\n\nThe error occurs because `forEach` runs functions with `this=undefined` by default, so the attempt to access `undefined.title` is made.\n\nThat doesn't affect arrow functions, because they just don't have `this`.\n\n```warn header=\"Arrow functions can't run with `new`\"\nNot having `this` naturally means another limitation: arrow functions can't be used as constructors. They can't be called with `new`.\n```\n\n```smart header=\"Arrow functions VS bind\"\nThere's a subtle difference between an arrow function `=>` and a regular function called with `.bind(this)`:\n\n- `.bind(this)` creates a \"bound version\" of the function.\n- The arrow `=>` doesn't create any binding. The function simply doesn't have `this`. The lookup of `this` is made exactly the same way as a regular variable search: in the outer lexical environment.\n```\n\n## Arrows have no \"arguments\"\n\nArrow functions also have no `arguments` variable.\n\nThat's great for decorators, when we need to forward a call with the current `this` and `arguments`.\n\nFor instance, `defer(f, ms)` gets a function and returns a wrapper around it that delays the call by `ms` milliseconds:\n\n```js run\nfunction defer(f, ms) {\n  return function() {\n    setTimeout(() => f.apply(this, arguments), ms)\n  };\n}\n\nfunction sayHi(who) {\n  alert('Hello, ' + who);\n}\n\nlet sayHiDeferred = defer(sayHi, 2000);\nsayHiDeferred(\"John\"); // Hello, John after 2 seconds\n```\n\nThe same without an arrow function would look like:\n\n```js\nfunction defer(f, ms) {\n  return function(...args) {\n    let ctx = this;\n    setTimeout(function() {\n      return f.apply(ctx, args);\n    }, ms);\n  };\n}\n```\n\nHere we had to create additional variables `args` and `ctx` so that the function inside `setTimeout` could take them.\n\n## Summary\n\nArrow functions:\n\n- Do not have `this`\n- Do not have `arguments`\n- Can't be called with `new`\n- They also don't have `super`, but we didn't study it yet. We will on the chapter <info:class-inheritance>\n\nThat's because they are meant for short pieces of code that do not have their own \"context\", but rather work in the current one. And they really shine in that use case.",

        "content": "\n\nAs we know, objects can store properties.\n\nUntil now, a property was a simple \"key-value\" pair to us. But an object property is actually a more flexible and powerful thing.\n\nIn this chapter we'll study additional configuration options, and in the next we'll see how to invisibly turn them into getter/setter functions.\n\n## Property flags\n\nObject properties, besides a **`value`**, have three special attributes (so-called \"flags\"):\n\n- **`writable`** -- if `true`, the value can be changed, otherwise it's read-only.\n- **`enumerable`** -- if `true`, then listed in loops, otherwise not listed.\n- **`configurable`** -- if `true`, the property can be deleted and these attributes can be modified, otherwise not.\n\nWe didn't see them yet, because generally they do not show up. When we create a property \"the usual way\", all of them are `true`. But we also can change them anytime.\n\nFirst, let's see how to get those flags.\n\nThe method [Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor](mdn:js/Object/getOwnPropertyDescriptor) allows to query the *full* information about a property.\n\nThe syntax is:\n```js\nlet descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(obj, propertyName);\n```\n\n`obj`\n: The object to get information from.\n\n`propertyName`\n: The name of the property.\n\nThe returned value is a so-called \"property descriptor\" object: it contains the value and all the flags.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\"\n};\n\nlet descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(user, 'name');\n\nalert( JSON.stringify(descriptor, null, 2 ) );\n/* property descriptor:\n{\n  \"value\": \"John\",\n  \"writable\": true,\n  \"enumerable\": true,\n  \"configurable\": true\n}\n*/\n```\n\nTo change the flags, we can use [Object.defineProperty](mdn:js/Object/defineProperty).\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\nObject.defineProperty(obj, propertyName, descriptor)\n```\n\n`obj`, `propertyName`\n: The object and its property to apply the descriptor.\n\n`descriptor`\n: Property descriptor object to apply.\n\nIf the property exists, `defineProperty` updates its flags. Otherwise, it creates the property with the given value and flags; in that case, if a flag is not supplied, it is assumed `false`.\n\nFor instance, here a property `name` is created with all falsy flags:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {};\n\n*!*\nObject.defineProperty(user, \"name\", {\n  value: \"John\"\n});\n*/!*\n\nlet descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(user, 'name');\n\nalert( JSON.stringify(descriptor, null, 2 ) );\n/*\n{\n  \"value\": \"John\",\n*!*\n  \"writable\": false,\n  \"enumerable\": false,\n  \"configurable\": false\n*/!*\n}\n */\n```\n\nCompare it with \"normally created\" `user.name` above: now all flags are falsy. If that's not what we want then we'd better set them to `true` in `descriptor`.\n\nNow let's see effects of the flags by example.\n\n## Non-writable\n\nLet's make `user.name` non-writable (can't be reassigned) by changing `writable` flag:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\"\n};\n\nObject.defineProperty(user, \"name\", {\n*!*\n  writable: false\n*/!*\n});\n\n*!*\nuser.name = \"Pete\"; // Error: Cannot assign to read only property 'name'\n*/!*\n```\n\nNow no one can change the name of our user, unless they apply their own `defineProperty` to override ours.\n\n```smart header=\"Errors appear only in strict mode\"\nIn the non-strict mode, no errors occur when writing to non-writable properties and such. But the operation still won't succeed. Flag-violating actions are just silently ignored in non-strict.\n```\n\nHere's the same example, but the property is created from scratch:\n\n```js run\nlet user = { };\n\nObject.defineProperty(user, \"name\", {\n*!*\n  value: \"John\",\n  // for new properties we need to explicitly list what's true\n  enumerable: true,\n  configurable: true\n*/!*\n});\n\nalert(user.name); // John\nuser.name = \"Pete\"; // Error\n```\n\n## Non-enumerable\n\nNow let's add a custom `toString` to `user`.\n\nNormally, a built-in `toString` for objects is non-enumerable, it does not show up in `for..in`. But if we add a `toString` of our own, then by default it shows up in `for..in`, like this:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  toString() {\n    return this.name;\n  }\n};\n\n// By default, both our properties are listed:\nfor (let key in user) alert(key); // name, toString\n```\n\nIf we don't like it, then we can set `enumerable:false`. Then it won't appear in a `for..in` loop, just like the built-in one:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  toString() {\n    return this.name;\n  }\n};\n\nObject.defineProperty(user, \"toString\", {\n*!*\n  enumerable: false\n*/!*\n});\n\n*!*\n// Now our toString disappears:\n*/!*\nfor (let key in user) alert(key); // name\n```\n\nNon-enumerable properties are also excluded from `Object.keys`:\n\n```js\nalert(Object.keys(user)); // name\n```\n\n## Non-configurable\n\nThe non-configurable flag (`configurable:false`) is sometimes preset for built-in objects and properties.\n\nA non-configurable property can not be deleted.\n\nFor instance, `Math.PI` is non-writable, non-enumerable and non-configurable:\n\n```js run\nlet descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(Math, 'PI');\n\nalert( JSON.stringify(descriptor, null, 2 ) );\n/*\n{\n  \"value\": 3.141592653589793,\n  \"writable\": false,\n  \"enumerable\": false,\n  \"configurable\": false\n}\n*/\n```\nSo, a programmer is unable to change the value of `Math.PI` or overwrite it.\n\n```js run\nMath.PI = 3; // Error\n\n// delete Math.PI won't work either\n```\n\nMaking a property non-configurable is a one-way road. We cannot change it back with `defineProperty`.\n\nTo be precise, non-configurability imposes several restrictions on `defineProperty`:\n1. Can't change `configurable` flag.\n2. Can't change `enumerable` flag.\n3. Can't change `writable: false` to `true` (the other way round works).\n4. Can't change `get/set` for an accessor property (but can assign them if absent).\n\nHere we are making `user.name` a \"forever sealed\" constant:\n\n```js run\nlet user = { };\n\nObject.defineProperty(user, \"name\", {\n  value: \"John\",\n  writable: false,\n  configurable: false\n});\n\n*!*\n// won't be able to change user.name or its flags\n// all this won't work:\n//   user.name = \"Pete\"\n//   delete user.name\n//   defineProperty(user, \"name\", { value: \"Pete\" })\nObject.defineProperty(user, \"name\", {writable: true}); // Error\n*/!*\n```\n\n```smart header=\"\\\"Non-configurable\\\" doesn't mean \\\"non-writable\\\"\"\nNotable exception: a value of non-configurable, but writable property can be changed.\n\nThe idea of `configurable: false` is to prevent changes to property flags and its deletion, not changes to its value.\n```\n\n## Object.defineProperties\n\nThere's a method [Object.defineProperties(obj, descriptors)](mdn:js/Object/defineProperties) that allows to define many properties at once.\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\nObject.defineProperties(obj, {\n  prop1: descriptor1,\n  prop2: descriptor2\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js\nObject.defineProperties(user, {\n  name: { value: \"John\", writable: false },\n  surname: { value: \"Smith\", writable: false },\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\nSo, we can set many properties at once.\n\n## Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors\n\nTo get all property descriptors at once, we can use the method [Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(obj)](mdn:js/Object/getOwnPropertyDescriptors).\n\nTogether with `Object.defineProperties` it can be used as a \"flags-aware\" way of cloning an object:\n\n```js\nlet clone = Object.defineProperties({}, Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(obj));\n```\n\nNormally when we clone an object, we use an assignment to copy properties, like this:\n\n```js\nfor (let key in user) {\n  clone[key] = user[key]\n}\n```\n\n...But that does not copy flags. So if we want a \"better\" clone then `Object.defineProperties` is preferred.\n\nAnother difference is that `for..in` ignores symbolic properties, but `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors` returns *all* property descriptors including symbolic ones.\n\n## Sealing an object globally\n\nProperty descriptors work at the level of individual properties.\n\nThere are also methods that limit access to the *whole* object:\n\n[Object.preventExtensions(obj)](mdn:js/Object/preventExtensions)\n: Forbids the addition of new properties to the object.\n\n[Object.seal(obj)](mdn:js/Object/seal)\n: Forbids adding/removing of properties. Sets `configurable: false` for all existing properties.\n\n[Object.freeze(obj)](mdn:js/Object/freeze)\n: Forbids adding/removing/changing of properties. Sets `configurable: false, writable: false` for all existing properties.\n\nAnd also there are tests for them:\n\n[Object.isExtensible(obj)](mdn:js/Object/isExtensible)\n: Returns `false` if adding properties is forbidden, otherwise `true`.\n\n[Object.isSealed(obj)](mdn:js/Object/isSealed)\n: Returns `true` if adding/removing properties is forbidden, and all existing properties have `configurable: false`.\n\n[Object.isFrozen(obj)](mdn:js/Object/isFrozen)\n: Returns `true` if adding/removing/changing properties is forbidden, and all current properties are `configurable: false, writable: false`.\n\nThese methods are rarely used in practice.",

        "content": "\n\nThere are two kinds of object properties.\n\nThe first kind is *data properties*. We already know how to work with them. All properties that we've been using until now were data properties.\n\nThe second type of properties is something new. It's *accessor properties*. They are essentially functions that execute on getting and setting a value, but look like regular properties to an external code.\n\n## Getters and setters\n\nAccessor properties are represented by \"getter\" and \"setter\" methods. In an object literal they are denoted by `get` and `set`:\n\n```js\nlet obj = {\n  *!*get propName()*/!* {\n    // getter, the code executed on getting obj.propName\n  },\n\n  *!*set propName(value)*/!* {\n    // setter, the code executed on setting obj.propName = value\n  }\n};\n```\n\nThe getter works when `obj.propName` is read, the setter -- when it is assigned.\n\nFor instance, we have a `user` object with `name` and `surname`:\n\n```js\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  surname: \"Smith\"\n};\n```\n\nNow we want to add a `fullName` property, that should be `\"John Smith\"`. Of course, we don't want to copy-paste existing information, so we can implement it as an accessor:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  surname: \"Smith\",\n\n*!*\n  get fullName() {\n    return `${this.name} ${this.surname}`;\n  }\n*/!*\n};\n\n*!*\nalert(user.fullName); // John Smith\n*/!*\n```\n\nFrom the outside, an accessor property looks like a regular one. That's the idea of accessor properties. We don't *call* `user.fullName` as a function, we *read* it normally: the getter runs behind the scenes.\n\nAs of now, `fullName` has only a getter. If we attempt to assign `user.fullName=`, there will be an error:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  get fullName() {\n    return `...`;\n  }\n};\n\n*!*\nuser.fullName = \"Test\"; // Error (property has only a getter)\n*/!*\n```\n\nLet's fix it by adding a setter for `user.fullName`:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  surname: \"Smith\",\n\n  get fullName() {\n    return `${this.name} ${this.surname}`;\n  },\n\n*!*\n  set fullName(value) {\n    [this.name, this.surname] = value.split(\" \");\n  }\n*/!*\n};\n\n// set fullName is executed with the given value.\nuser.fullName = \"Alice Cooper\";\n\nalert(user.name); // Alice\nalert(user.surname); // Cooper\n```\n\nAs the result, we have a \"virtual\" property `fullName`. It is readable and writable.\n\n## Accessor descriptors\n\nDescriptors for accessor properties are different from those for data properties.\n\nFor accessor properties, there is no `value` or `writable`, but instead there are `get` and `set` functions.\n\nThat is, an accessor descriptor may have:\n\n- **`get`** -- a function without arguments, that works when a property is read,\n- **`set`** -- a function with one argument, that is called when the property is set,\n- **`enumerable`** -- same as for data properties,\n- **`configurable`** -- same as for data properties.\n\nFor instance, to create an accessor `fullName` with `defineProperty`, we can pass a descriptor with `get` and `set`:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  surname: \"Smith\"\n};\n\n*!*\nObject.defineProperty(user, 'fullName', {\n  get() {\n    return `${this.name} ${this.surname}`;\n  },\n\n  set(value) {\n    [this.name, this.surname] = value.split(\" \");\n  }\n*/!*\n});\n\nalert(user.fullName); // John Smith\n\nfor(let key in user) alert(key); // name, surname\n```\n\nPlease note that a property can be either an accessor (has `get/set` methods) or a data property (has a `value`), not both.\n\nIf we try to supply both `get` and `value` in the same descriptor, there will be an error:\n\n```js run\n*!*\n// Error: Invalid property descriptor.\n*/!*\nObject.defineProperty({}, 'prop', {\n  get() {\n    return 1\n  },\n\n  value: 2\n});\n```\n\n## Smarter getters/setters\n\nGetters/setters can be used as wrappers over \"real\" property values to gain more control over operations with them.\n\nFor instance, if we want to forbid too short names for `user`, we can have a setter `name` and keep the value in a separate property `_name`:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  get name() {\n    return this._name;\n  },\n\n  set name(value) {\n    if (value.length < 4) {\n      alert(\"Name is too short, need at least 4 characters\");\n      return;\n    }\n    this._name = value;\n  }\n};\n\nuser.name = \"Pete\";\nalert(user.name); // Pete\n\nuser.name = \"\"; // Name is too short...\n```\n\nSo, the name is stored in `_name` property, and the access is done via getter and setter.\n\nTechnically, external code is able to access the name directly by using `user._name`. But there is a widely known convention that properties starting with an underscore `\"_\"` are internal and should not be touched from outside the object.\n\n\n## Using for compatibility\n\nOne of the great uses of accessors is that they allow to take control over a \"regular\" data property at any moment by replacing it with a getter and a setter and tweak its behavior.\n\nImagine we started implementing user objects using data properties `name` and `age`:\n\n```js\nfunction User(name, age) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.age = age;\n}\n\nlet john = new User(\"John\", 25);\n\nalert( john.age ); // 25\n```\n\n...But sooner or later, things may change. Instead of `age` we may decide to store `birthday`, because it's more precise and convenient:\n\n```js\nfunction User(name, birthday) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.birthday = birthday;\n}\n\nlet john = new User(\"John\", new Date(1992, 6, 1));\n```\n\nNow what to do with the old code that still uses `age` property?\n\nWe can try to find all such places and fix them, but that takes time and can be hard to do if that code is used by many other people. And besides, `age` is a nice thing to have in `user`, right?\n\nLet's keep it.\n\nAdding a getter for `age` solves the problem:\n\n```js run no-beautify\nfunction User(name, birthday) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.birthday = birthday;\n\n*!*\n  // age is calculated from the current date and birthday\n  Object.defineProperty(this, \"age\", {\n    get() {\n      let todayYear = new Date().getFullYear();\n      return todayYear - this.birthday.getFullYear();\n    }\n  });\n*/!*\n}\n\nlet john = new User(\"John\", new Date(1992, 6, 1));\n\nalert( john.birthday ); // birthday is available\nalert( john.age );      // ...as well as the age\n```\n\nNow the old code works too and we've got a nice additional property.",

        "content": "\n\nIn programming, we often want to take something and extend it.\n\nFor instance, we have a `user` object with its properties and methods, and want to make `admin` and `guest` as slightly modified variants of it. We'd like to reuse what we have in `user`, not copy/reimplement its methods, just build a new object on top of it.\n\n*Prototypal inheritance* is a language feature that helps in that.\n\n## [[Prototype]]\n\nIn JavaScript, objects have a special hidden property `[[Prototype]]` (as named in the specification), that is either `null` or references another object. That object is called \"a prototype\":\n\n![prototype](object-prototype-empty.svg)\n\nThe prototype is a little bit \"magical\". When we want to read a property from `object`, and it's missing, JavaScript automatically takes it from the prototype. In programming, such thing is called \"prototypal inheritance\". Many cool language features and programming techniques are based on it.\n\nThe property `[[Prototype]]` is internal and hidden, but there are many ways to set it.\n\nOne of them is to use the special name `__proto__`, like this:\n\n```js run\nlet animal = {\n  eats: true\n};\nlet rabbit = {\n  jumps: true\n};\n\n*!*\nrabbit.__proto__ = animal;\n*/!*\n```\n\n```smart header=\"`__proto__` is a historical getter/setter for `[[Prototype]]`\"\nPlease note that `__proto__` is *not the same* as `[[Prototype]]`. It's a getter/setter for it.\n\nIt exists for historical reasons. In modern language it is replaced with functions `Object.getPrototypeOf/Object.setPrototypeOf` that also get/set the prototype. We'll study the reasons for that and these functions later.\n\nBy the specification, `__proto__` must only be supported by browsers, but in fact all environments including server-side support it. For now, as `__proto__` notation is a little bit more intuitively obvious, we'll use it in the examples.\n```\n\nIf we look for a property in `rabbit`, and it's missing, JavaScript automatically takes it from `animal`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js\nlet animal = {\n  eats: true\n};\nlet rabbit = {\n  jumps: true\n};\n\n*!*\nrabbit.__proto__ = animal; // (*)\n*/!*\n\n// we can find both properties in rabbit now:\n*!*\nalert( rabbit.eats ); // true (**)\n*/!*\nalert( rabbit.jumps ); // true\n```\n\nHere the line `(*)` sets `animal` to be a prototype of `rabbit`.\n\nThen, when `alert` tries to read property `rabbit.eats` `(**)`, it's not in `rabbit`, so JavaScript follows the `[[Prototype]]` reference and finds it in `animal` (look from the bottom up):\n\n![](proto-animal-rabbit.svg)\n\nHere we can say that \"`animal` is the prototype of `rabbit`\" or \"`rabbit` prototypically inherits from `animal`\".\n\nSo if `animal` has a lot of useful properties and methods, then they become automatically available in `rabbit`. Such properties are called \"inherited\".\n\nIf we have a method in `animal`, it can be called on `rabbit`:\n\n```js run\nlet animal = {\n  eats: true,\n*!*\n  walk() {\n    alert(\"Animal walk\");\n  }\n*/!*\n};\n\nlet rabbit = {\n  jumps: true,\n  __proto__: animal\n};\n\n// walk is taken from the prototype\n*!*\nrabbit.walk(); // Animal walk\n*/!*\n```\n\nThe method is automatically taken from the prototype, like this:\n\n![](proto-animal-rabbit-walk.svg)\n\nThe prototype chain can be longer:\n\n```js run\nlet animal = {\n  eats: true,\n  walk() {\n    alert(\"Animal walk\");\n  }\n};\n\nlet rabbit = {\n  jumps: true,\n*!*\n  __proto__: animal\n*/!*\n};\n\nlet longEar = {\n  earLength: 10,\n*!*\n  __proto__: rabbit\n*/!*\n};\n\n// walk is taken from the prototype chain\nlongEar.walk(); // Animal walk\nalert(longEar.jumps); // true (from rabbit)\n```\n\n![](proto-animal-rabbit-chain.svg)\n\nThere are only two limitations:\n\n1. The references can't go in circles. JavaScript will throw an error if we try to assign `__proto__` in a circle.\n2. The value of `__proto__` can be either an object or `null`. Other types are ignored.\n\nAlso it may be obvious, but still: there can be only one `[[Prototype]]`. An object may not inherit from two others.\n\n## Writing doesn't use prototype\n\nThe prototype is only used for reading properties.\n\nWrite/delete operations work directly with the object.\n\nIn the example below, we assign its own `walk` method to `rabbit`:\n\n```js run\nlet animal = {\n  eats: true,\n  walk() {\n    /* this method won't be used by rabbit */  \n  }\n};\n\nlet rabbit = {\n  __proto__: animal\n};\n\n*!*\nrabbit.walk = function() {\n  alert(\"Rabbit! Bounce-bounce!\");\n};\n*/!*\n\nrabbit.walk(); // Rabbit! Bounce-bounce!\n```\n\nFrom now on, `rabbit.walk()` call finds the method immediately in the object and executes it, without using the prototype:\n\n![](proto-animal-rabbit-walk-2.svg)\n\nAccessor properties are an exception, as assignment is handled by a setter function. So writing to such a property is actually the same as calling a function.\n\nFor that reason `admin.fullName` works correctly in the code below:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  surname: \"Smith\",\n\n  set fullName(value) {\n    [this.name, this.surname] = value.split(\" \");\n  },\n\n  get fullName() {\n    return `${this.name} ${this.surname}`;\n  }\n};\n\nlet admin = {\n  __proto__: user,\n  isAdmin: true\n};\n\nalert(admin.fullName); // John Smith (*)\n\n// setter triggers!\nadmin.fullName = \"Alice Cooper\"; // (**)\n```\n\nHere in the line `(*)` the property `admin.fullName` has a getter in the prototype `user`, so it is called. And in the line `(**)` the property has a setter in the prototype, so it is called.\n\n## The value of \"this\"\n\nAn interesting question may arise in the example above: what's the value of `this` inside `set fullName(value)`? Where are the properties `this.name` and `this.surname` written: into `user` or `admin`?\n\nThe answer is simple: `this` is not affected by prototypes at all.\n\n**No matter where the method is found: in an object or its prototype. In a method call, `this` is always the object before the dot.**\n\nSo, the setter call `admin.fullName=` uses `admin` as `this`, not `user`.\n\nThat is actually a super-important thing, because we may have a big object with many methods, and have objects that inherit from it. And when the inheriting objects run the inherited methods, they will modify only their own states, not the state of the big object.\n\nFor instance, here `animal` represents a \"method storage\", and `rabbit` makes use of it.\n\nThe call `rabbit.sleep()` sets `this.isSleeping` on the `rabbit` object:\n\n```js run\n// animal has methods\nlet animal = {\n  walk() {\n    if (!this.isSleeping) {\n      alert(`I walk`);\n    }\n  },\n  sleep() {\n    this.isSleeping = true;\n  }\n};\n\nlet rabbit = {\n  name: \"White Rabbit\",\n  __proto__: animal\n};\n\n// modifies rabbit.isSleeping\nrabbit.sleep();\n\nalert(rabbit.isSleeping); // true\nalert(animal.isSleeping); // undefined (no such property in the prototype)\n```\n\nThe resulting picture:\n\n![](proto-animal-rabbit-walk-3.svg)\n\nIf we had other objects, like `bird`, `snake`, etc., inheriting from `animal`, they would also gain access to methods of `animal`. But `this` in each method call would be the corresponding object, evaluated at the call-time (before dot), not `animal`. So when we write data into `this`, it is stored into these objects.\n\nAs a result, methods are shared, but the object state is not.\n\n## for..in loop\n\nThe `for..in` loop iterates over inherited properties too.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet animal = {\n  eats: true\n};\n\nlet rabbit = {\n  jumps: true,\n  __proto__: animal\n};\n\n*!*\n// Object.keys only returns own keys\nalert(Object.keys(rabbit)); // jumps\n*/!*\n\n*!*\n// for..in loops over both own and inherited keys\nfor(let prop in rabbit) alert(prop); // jumps, then eats\n*/!*\n```\n\nIf that's not what we want, and we'd like to exclude inherited properties, there's a built-in method [obj.hasOwnProperty(key)](mdn:js/Object/hasOwnProperty): it returns `true` if `obj` has its own (not inherited) property named `key`.\n\nSo we can filter out inherited properties (or do something else with them):\n\n```js run\nlet animal = {\n  eats: true\n};\n\nlet rabbit = {\n  jumps: true,\n  __proto__: animal\n};\n\nfor(let prop in rabbit) {\n  let isOwn = rabbit.hasOwnProperty(prop);\n\n  if (isOwn) {\n    alert(`Our: ${prop}`); // Our: jumps\n  } else {\n    alert(`Inherited: ${prop}`); // Inherited: eats\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere we have the following inheritance chain: `rabbit` inherits from `animal`, that inherits from `Object.prototype` (because `animal` is a literal object `{...}`, so it's by default), and then `null` above it:\n\n![](rabbit-animal-object.svg)\n\nNote, there's one funny thing. Where is the method `rabbit.hasOwnProperty` coming from? We did not define it. Looking at the chain we can see that the method is provided by `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty`. In other words, it's inherited.\n\n...But why does `hasOwnProperty` not appear in the `for..in` loop like `eats` and `jumps` do, if `for..in` lists inherited properties?\n\nThe answer is simple: it's not enumerable. Just like all other properties of `Object.prototype`, it has `enumerable:false` flag. And `for..in` only lists enumerable properties. That's why it and the rest of the `Object.prototype` properties are not listed.\n\n```smart header=\"Almost all other key/value-getting methods ignore inherited properties\"\nAlmost all other key/value-getting methods, such as `Object.keys`, `Object.values` and so on ignore inherited properties.\n\nThey only operate on the object itself. Properties from the prototype are *not* taken into account.\n```\n\n## Summary\n\n- In JavaScript, all objects have a hidden `[[Prototype]]` property that's either another object or `null`.\n- We can use `obj.__proto__` to access it (a historical getter/setter, there are other ways, to be covered soon).\n- The object referenced by `[[Prototype]]` is called a \"prototype\".\n- If we want to read a property of `obj` or call a method, and it doesn't exist, then JavaScript tries to find it in the prototype.\n- Write/delete operations act directly on the object, they don't use the prototype (assuming it's a data property, not a setter).\n- If we call `obj.method()`, and the `method` is taken from the prototype, `this` still references `obj`. So methods always work with the current object even if they are inherited.\n- The `for..in` loop iterates over both its own and its inherited properties. All other key/value-getting methods only operate on the object itself.",

The method `speedy.eat` is found in the prototype (`=hamster`), then executed with `this=speedy` (the object before the dot).\n\n2. Then `this.stomach.push()` needs to find `stomach` property and call `push` on it. It looks for `stomach` in `this` (`=speedy`), but nothing found.\n\n3. Then it follows the prototype chain and finds `stomach` in `hamster`.\n\n4. Then it calls `push` on it, adding the food into *the stomach of the prototype*.\n\nSo all hamsters share a single stomach!\n\nBoth for `lazy.stomach.push(...)` and `speedy.stomach.push()`, the property `stomach` is found in the prototype (as it's not in the object itself), then the new data is pushed into it.\n\nPlease note that such thing doesn't happen in case of a simple assignment `this.stomach=`:\n\n```js run\nlet hamster = {\n  stomach: [],\n\n  eat(food) {\n*!*\n    // assign to this.stomach instead of this.stomach.push\n    this.stomach = [food];\n*/!*\n  }\n};\n\nlet speedy = {\n   __proto__: hamster\n};\n\nlet lazy = {\n  __proto__: hamster\n};\n\n// Speedy one found the food\nspeedy.eat(\"apple\");\nalert( speedy.stomach ); // apple\n\n// Lazy one's stomach is empty\nalert( lazy.stomach ); // <nothing>\n```\n\nNow all works fine, because `this.stomach=` does not perform a lookup of `stomach`.

It was one of the core features of the language.\n\nBut in the old times, there was no direct access to it. The only thing that worked reliably was a `\"prototype\"` property of the constructor function, described in this chapter. So there are many scripts that still use it.\n```\n\nPlease note that `F.prototype` here means a regular property named `\"prototype\"` on `F`. It sounds something similar to the term \"prototype\", but here we really mean a regular property with this name.\n\nHere's the example:\n\n```js run\nlet animal = {\n  eats: true\n};\n\nfunction Rabbit(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\n\n*!*\nRabbit.prototype = animal;\n*/!*\n\nlet rabbit = new Rabbit(\"White Rabbit\"); //  rabbit.__proto__ == animal\n\nalert( rabbit.eats ); // true\n```\n\nSetting `Rabbit.prototype = animal` literally states the following: \"When a `new Rabbit` is created, assign its `[[Prototype]]` to `animal`\".\n\nThat's the resulting picture:\n\n![](proto-constructor-animal-rabbit.svg)\n\nOn the picture, `\"prototype\"` is a horizontal arrow, meaning a regular property, and `[[Prototype]]` is vertical, meaning the inheritance of `rabbit` from `animal`.\n\n```smart header=\"`F.prototype` only used at `new F` time\"\n`F.prototype` property is only used when `new F` is called, it assigns `[[Prototype]]` of the new object.\n\nIf, after the creation, `F.prototype` property changes (`F.prototype = <another object>`), then new objects created by `new F` will have another object as `[[Prototype]]`, but already existing objects keep the old one.\n```\n\n## Default F.prototype, constructor property\n\nEvery function has the `\"prototype\"` property even if we don't supply it.\n\nThe default `\"prototype\"` is an object with the only property `constructor` that points back to the function itself.\n\nLike this:\n\n```js\nfunction Rabbit() {}\n\n/* default prototype\nRabbit.prototype = { constructor: Rabbit };\n*/\n```\n\n![](function-prototype-constructor.svg)\n\nWe can check it:\n\n```js run\nfunction Rabbit() {}\n// by default:\n// Rabbit.prototype = { constructor: Rabbit }\n\nalert( Rabbit.prototype.constructor == Rabbit ); // true\n```\n\nNaturally, if we do nothing, the `constructor` property is available to all rabbits through  `[[Prototype]]`:\n\n```js run\nfunction Rabbit() {}\n// by default:\n// Rabbit.prototype = { constructor: Rabbit }\n\nlet rabbit = new Rabbit(); // inherits from {constructor: Rabbit}\n\nalert(rabbit.constructor == Rabbit); // true (from prototype)\n```\n\n![](rabbit-prototype-constructor.svg)\n\nWe can use `constructor` property to create a new object using the same constructor as the existing one.\n\nLike here:\n\n```js run\nfunction Rabbit(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n  alert(name);\n}\n\nlet rabbit = new Rabbit(\"White Rabbit\");\n\n*!*\nlet rabbit2 = new rabbit.constructor(\"Black Rabbit\");\n*/!*\n```\n\nThat's handy when we have an object, don't know which constructor was used for it (e.g. it comes from a 3rd party library), and we need to create another one of the same kind.\n\nBut probably the most important thing about `\"constructor\"` is that...\n\n**...JavaScript itself does not ensure the right `\"constructor\"` value.**\n\nYes, it exists in the default `\"prototype\"` for functions, but that's all. What happens with it later -- is totally on us.\n\nIn particular, if we replace the default prototype as a whole, then there will be no `\"constructor\"` in it.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nfunction Rabbit() {}\nRabbit.prototype = {\n  jumps: true\n};\n\nlet rabbit = new Rabbit();\n*!*\nalert(rabbit.constructor === Rabbit); // false\n*/!*\n```\n\nSo, to keep the right `\"constructor\"` we can choose to add/remove properties to the default `\"prototype\"` instead of overwriting it as a whole:\n\n```js\nfunction Rabbit() {}\n\n// Not overwrite Rabbit.prototype totally\n// just add to it\nRabbit.prototype.jumps = true\n// the default Rabbit.prototype.constructor is preserved\n```\n\nOr, alternatively, recreate the `constructor` property manually:\n\n```js\nRabbit.prototype = {\n  jumps: true,\n*!*\n  constructor: Rabbit\n*/!*\n};\n\n// now constructor is also correct, because we added it\n```\n\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter we briefly described the way of setting a `[[Prototype]]` for objects created via a constructor function. Later we'll see more advanced programming patterns that rely on it.\n\nEverything is quite simple, just a few notes to make things clear:\n\n- The `F.prototype` property (don't mistake it for `[[Prototype]]`) sets `[[Prototype]]` of new objects when `new F()` is called.\n- The value of `F.prototype` should be either an object or `null`: other values won't work.\n-  The `\"prototype\"` property only has such a special effect when set on a constructor function, and invoked with `new`.\n\nOn regular objects the `prototype` is nothing special:\n```js\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  prototype: \"Bla-bla\" // no magic at all\n};\n```\n\nBy default all functions have `F.prototype = { constructor: F }`, so we can get the constructor of an object by accessing its `\"constructor\"` property.",

        "content": "\n\nThe `\"prototype\"` property is widely used by the core of JavaScript itself. All built-in constructor functions use it.\n\nFirst we'll see at the details, and then how to use it for adding new capabilities to built-in objects.\n\n## Object.prototype\n\nLet's say we output an empty object:\n\n```js run\nlet obj = {};\nalert( obj ); // \"[object Object]\" ?\n```\n\nWhere's the code that generates the string `\"[object Object]\"`? That's a built-in `toString` method, but where is it? The `obj` is empty!\n\n...But the short notation `obj = {}` is the same as `obj = new Object()`, where `Object` is a built-in object constructor function, with its own `prototype` referencing a huge object with `toString` and other methods.\n\nHere's what's going on:\n\n![](object-prototype.svg)\n\nWhen `new Object()` is called (or a literal object `{...}` is created), the `[[Prototype]]` of it is set to `Object.prototype` according to the rule that we discussed in the previous chapter:\n\n![](object-prototype-1.svg)\n\nSo then when `obj.toString()` is called the method is taken from `Object.prototype`.\n\nWe can check it like this:\n\n```js run\nlet obj = {};\n\nalert(obj.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true\n// obj.toString === obj.__proto__.toString == Object.prototype.toString\n```\n\nPlease note that there is no more `[[Prototype]]` in the chain above `Object.prototype`:\n\n```js run\nalert(Object.prototype.__proto__); // null\n```\n\n## Other built-in prototypes\n\nOther built-in objects such as `Array`, `Date`, `Function` and others also keep methods in prototypes.\n\nFor instance, when we create an array `[1, 2, 3]`, the default `new Array()` constructor is used internally. So `Array.prototype` becomes its prototype and provides methods. That's very memory-efficient.\n\nBy specification, all of the built-in prototypes have `Object.prototype` on the top. That's why some people say that \"everything inherits from objects\".\n\nHere's the overall picture (for 3 built-ins to fit):\n\n![](native-prototypes-classes.svg)\n\nLet's check the prototypes manually:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [1, 2, 3];\n\n// it inherits from Array.prototype?\nalert( arr.__proto__ === Array.prototype ); // true\n\n// then from Object.prototype?\nalert( arr.__proto__.__proto__ === Object.prototype ); // true\n\n// and null on the top.\nalert( arr.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__ ); // null\n```\n\nSome methods in prototypes may overlap, for instance, `Array.prototype` has its own `toString` that lists comma-delimited elements:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [1, 2, 3]\nalert(arr); // 1,2,3 <-- the result of Array.prototype.toString\n```\n\nAs we've seen before, `Object.prototype` has `toString` as well, but `Array.prototype` is closer in the chain, so the array variant is used.\n\n\n![](native-prototypes-array-tostring.svg)\n\n\nIn-browser tools like Chrome developer console also show inheritance (`console.dir` may need to be used for built-in objects):\n\n![](console_dir_array.png)\n\nOther built-in objects also work the same way. Even functions -- they are objects of a built-in `Function` constructor, and their methods (`call`/`apply` and others) are taken from `Function.prototype`. Functions have their own `toString` too.\n\n```js run\nfunction f() {}\n\nalert(f.__proto__ == Function.prototype); // true\nalert(f.__proto__.__proto__ == Object.prototype); // true, inherit from objects\n```\n\n## Primitives\n\nThe most intricate thing happens with strings, numbers and booleans.\n\nAs we remember, they are not objects. But if we try to access their properties, temporary wrapper objects are created using built-in constructors `String`, `Number` and `Boolean`. They provide the methods and disappear.\n\nThese objects are created invisibly to us and most engines optimize them out, but the specification describes it exactly this way. Methods of these objects also reside in prototypes, available as `String.prototype`, `Number.prototype` and `Boolean.prototype`.\n\n```warn header=\"Values `null` and `undefined` have no object wrappers\"\nSpecial values `null` and `undefined` stand apart. They have no object wrappers, so methods and properties are not available for them. And there are no corresponding prototypes either.\n```\n\n## Changing native prototypes [#native-prototype-change]\n\nNative prototypes can be modified. For instance, if we add a method to `String.prototype`,  it becomes available to all strings:\n\n```js run\nString.prototype.show = function() {\n  alert(this);\n};\n\n\"BOOM!\".show(); // BOOM!\n```\n\nDuring the process of development, we may have ideas for new built-in methods we'd like to have, and we may be tempted to add them to native prototypes. But that is generally a bad idea.\n\n```warn\nPrototypes are global, so it's easy to get a conflict. If two libraries add a method `String.prototype.show`, then one of them will be overwriting the method of the other.\n\nSo, generally, modifying a native prototype is considered a bad idea.\n```\n\n**In modern programming, there is only one case where modifying native prototypes is approved. That's polyfilling.**\n\nPolyfilling is a term for making a substitute for a method that exists in the JavaScript specification, but is not yet supported by a particular JavaScript engine.\n\nWe may then implement it manually and populate the built-in prototype with it.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nif (!String.prototype.repeat) { // if there's no such method\n  // add it to the prototype\n\n  String.prototype.repeat = function(n) {\n    // repeat the string n times\n\n    // actually, the code should be a little bit more complex than that\n    // (the full algorithm is in the specification)\n    // but even an imperfect polyfill is often considered good enough\n    return new Array(n + 1).join(this);\n  };\n}\n\nalert( \"La\".repeat(3) ); // LaLaLa\n```\n\n\n## Borrowing from prototypes\n\nIn the chapter <info:call-apply-decorators#method-borrowing> we talked about method borrowing.\n\nThat's when we take a method from one object and copy it into another.\n\nSome methods of native prototypes are often borrowed.\n\nFor instance, if we're making an array-like object, we may want to copy some `Array` methods to it.\n\nE.g.\n\n```js run\nlet obj = {\n  0: \"Hello\",\n  1: \"world!\",\n  length: 2,\n};\n\n*!*\nobj.join = Array.prototype.join;\n*/!*\n\nalert( obj.join(',') ); // Hello,world!\n```\n\nIt works because the internal algorithm of the built-in `join` method only cares about the correct indexes and the `length` property. It doesn't check if the object is indeed an array. Many built-in methods are like that.\n\nAnother possibility is to inherit by setting `obj.__proto__` to `Array.prototype`, so all `Array` methods are automatically available in `obj`.\n\nBut that's impossible if `obj` already inherits from another object. Remember, we only can inherit from one object at a time.\n\nBorrowing methods is flexible, it allows to mix functionalities from different objects if needed.\n\n## Summary\n\n- All built-in objects follow the same pattern:\n    - The methods are stored in the prototype (`Array.prototype`, `Object.prototype`, `Date.prototype`, etc.)\n    - The object itself stores only the data (array items, object properties, the date)\n- Primitives also store methods in prototypes of wrapper objects: `Number.prototype`, `String.prototype` and `Boolean.prototype`. Only `undefined` and `null` do not have wrapper objects\n- Built-in prototypes can be modified or populated with new methods. But it's not recommended to change them. The only allowable case is probably when we add-in a new standard, but it's not yet supported by the JavaScript engine",

        "content": "\n\nIn the first chapter of this section, we mentioned that there are modern methods to setup a prototype.\n\nThe `__proto__` is considered outdated and somewhat deprecated (in browser-only part of the JavaScript standard).\n\nThe modern methods are:\n\n- [Object.create(proto[, descriptors])](mdn:js/Object/create) -- creates an empty object with given `proto` as `[[Prototype]]` and optional property descriptors.\n- [Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)](mdn:js/Object/getPrototypeOf) -- returns the `[[Prototype]]` of `obj`.\n- [Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, proto)](mdn:js/Object/setPrototypeOf) -- sets the `[[Prototype]]` of `obj` to `proto`.\n\nThese should be used instead of `__proto__`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet animal = {\n  eats: true\n};\n\n// create a new object with animal as a prototype\n*!*\nlet rabbit = Object.create(animal);\n*/!*\n\nalert(rabbit.eats); // true\n\n*!*\nalert(Object.getPrototypeOf(rabbit) === animal); // true\n*/!*\n\n*!*\nObject.setPrototypeOf(rabbit, {}); // change the prototype of rabbit to {}\n*/!*\n```\n\n`Object.create` has an optional second argument: property descriptors. We can provide additional properties to the new object there, like this:\n\n```js run\nlet animal = {\n  eats: true\n};\n\nlet rabbit = Object.create(animal, {\n  jumps: {\n    value: true\n  }\n});\n\nalert(rabbit.jumps); // true\n```\n\nThe descriptors are in the same format as described in the chapter <info:property-descriptors>.\n\nWe can use `Object.create` to perform an object cloning more powerful than copying properties in `for..in`:\n\n```js\nlet clone = Object.create(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj), Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(obj));\n```\n\nThis call makes a truly exact copy of `obj`, including all properties: enumerable and non-enumerable, data properties and setters/getters -- everything, and with the right `[[Prototype]]`.\n\n## Brief history\n\nIf we count all the ways to manage `[[Prototype]]`, there are a lot! Many ways to do the same thing!\n\nWhy?\n\nThat's for historical reasons.\n\n- The `\"prototype\"` property of a constructor function has worked since very ancient times.\n- Later, in the year 2012, `Object.create` appeared in the standard. It gave the ability to create objects with a given prototype, but did not provide the ability to get/set it. So browsers implemented the non-standard `__proto__` accessor that allowed the user to get/set a prototype at any time.\n- Later, in the year 2015, `Object.setPrototypeOf` and `Object.getPrototypeOf` were added to the standard, to perform the same functionality as `__proto__`. As `__proto__` was de-facto implemented everywhere, it was kind-of deprecated and made its way to the Annex B of the standard, that is: optional for non-browser environments.\n\nAs of now we have all these ways at our disposal.\n\nWhy was `__proto__` replaced by the functions `getPrototypeOf/setPrototypeOf`? That's an interesting question, requiring us to understand why `__proto__` is bad. Read on to get the answer.\n\n```warn header=\"Don't change `[[Prototype]]` on existing objects if speed matters\"\nTechnically, we can get/set `[[Prototype]]` at any time. But usually we only set it once at the object creation time and don't modify it anymore: `rabbit` inherits from `animal`, and that is not going to change.\n\nAnd JavaScript engines are highly optimized for this. Changing a prototype \"on-the-fly\" with `Object.setPrototypeOf` or `obj.__proto__=` is a very slow operation as it breaks internal optimizations for object property access operations. So avoid it unless you know what you're doing, or JavaScript speed totally doesn't matter for you.\n```\n\n## \"Very plain\" objects [#very-plain]\n\nAs we know, objects can be used as associative arrays to store key/value pairs.\n\n...But if we try to store *user-provided* keys in it (for instance, a user-entered dictionary), we can see an interesting glitch: all keys work fine except `\"__proto__\"`.\n\nCheck out the example:\n\n```js run\nlet obj = {};\n\nlet key = prompt(\"What's the key?\", \"__proto__\");\nobj[key] = \"some value\";\n\nalert(obj[key]); // [object Object], not \"some value\"!\n```\n\nHere, if the user types in `__proto__`, the assignment is ignored!\n\nThat shouldn't surprise us. The `__proto__` property is special: it must be either an object or `null`. A string can not become a prototype.\n\nBut we didn't *intend* to implement such behavior, right? We want to store key/value pairs, and the key named `\"__proto__\"` was not properly saved. So that's a bug!\n\nHere the consequences are not terrible. But in other cases we may be assigning object values, and then the prototype may indeed be changed. As a result, the execution will go wrong in totally unexpected ways.\n\nWhat's worse -- usually developers do not think about such possibility at all. That makes such bugs hard to notice and even turn them into vulnerabilities, especially when JavaScript is used on server-side.\n\nUnexpected things also may happen when assigning to `toString`, which is a function by default, and to other built-in methods.\n\nHow can we avoid this problem?\n\nFirst, we can just switch to using `Map` for storage instead of plain objects, then everything's fine.\n\nBut `Object` can also serve us well here, because language creators gave thought to that problem long ago.\n\n`__proto__` is not a property of an object, but an accessor property of `Object.prototype`:\n\n![](object-prototype-2.svg)\n\nSo, if `obj.__proto__` is read or set, the corresponding getter/setter is called from its prototype, and it gets/sets `[[Prototype]]`.\n\nAs it was said in the beginning of this tutorial section: `__proto__` is a way to access `[[Prototype]]`, it is not `[[Prototype]]` itself.\n\nNow, if we intend to use an object as an associative array and be free of such problems, we can do it with a little trick:\n\n```js run\n*!*\nlet obj = Object.create(null);\n*/!*\n\nlet key = prompt(\"What's the key?\", \"__proto__\");\nobj[key] = \"some value\";\n\nalert(obj[key]); // \"some value\"\n```\n\n`Object.create(null)` creates an empty object without a prototype (`[[Prototype]]` is `null`):\n\n![](object-prototype-null.svg)\n\nSo, there is no inherited getter/setter for `__proto__`. Now it is processed as a regular data property, so the example above works right.\n\nWe can call such objects \"very plain\" or \"pure dictionary\" objects, because they are even simpler than the regular plain object `{...}`.\n\nA downside is that such objects lack any built-in object methods, e.g. `toString`:\n\n```js run\n*!*\nlet obj = Object.create(null);\n*/!*\n\nalert(obj); // Error (no toString)\n```\n\n...But that's usually fine for associative arrays.\n\nNote that most object-related methods are `Object.something(...)`, like `Object.keys(obj)` -- they are not in the prototype, so they will keep working on such objects:\n\n\n```js run\nlet chineseDictionary = Object.create(null);\nchineseDictionary.hello = \"你好\";\nchineseDictionary.bye = \"再见\";\n\nalert(Object.keys(chineseDictionary)); // hello,bye\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nModern methods to set up and directly access the prototype are:\n\n- [Object.create(proto[, descriptors])](mdn:js/Object/create) -- creates an empty object with a given `proto` as `[[Prototype]]` (can be `null`) and optional property descriptors.\n- [Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)](mdn:js/Object.getPrototypeOf) -- returns the `[[Prototype]]` of `obj` (same as `__proto__` getter).\n- [Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, proto)](mdn:js/Object.setPrototypeOf) -- sets the `[[Prototype]]` of `obj` to `proto` (same as `__proto__` setter).\n\nThe built-in `__proto__` getter/setter is unsafe if we'd want to put user-generated keys into an object. Just because a user may enter `\"__proto__\"` as the key, and there'll be an error, with hopefully light, but generally unpredictable consequences.\n\nSo we can either use `Object.create(null)` to create a \"very plain\" object without `__proto__`, or stick to `Map` objects for that.\n\nAlso, `Object.create` provides an easy way to shallow-copy an object with all descriptors:\n\n```js\nlet clone = Object.create(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj), Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(obj));\n```\n\nWe also made it clear that `__proto__` is a getter/setter for `[[Prototype]]` and resides in `Object.prototype`, just like other methods.\n\nWe can create an object without a prototype by `Object.create(null)`. Such objects are used as \"pure dictionaries\", they have no issues with `\"__proto__\"` as the key.\n\nOther methods:\n\n- [Object.keys(obj)](mdn:js/Object/keys) / [Object.values(obj)](mdn:js/Object/values) / [Object.entries(obj)](mdn:js/Object/entries) -- returns an array of enumerable own string property names/values/key-value pairs.\n- [Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(obj)](mdn:js/Object/getOwnPropertySymbols) -- returns an array of all own symbolic keys.\n- [Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)](mdn:js/Object/getOwnPropertyNames) -- returns an array of all own string keys.\n- [Reflect.ownKeys(obj)](mdn:js/Reflect/ownKeys) -- returns an array of all own keys.\n- [obj.hasOwnProperty(key)](mdn:js/Object/hasOwnProperty): returns `true` if `obj` has its own (not inherited) key named `key`.\n\nAll methods that return object properties (like `Object.keys` and others) -- return \"own\" properties. If we want inherited ones, we can use `for..in`.",

A new object is created.\n2. The `constructor` runs with the given argument and assigns `this.name` to it.\n\n...Then we can call object methods, such as `user.sayHi()`.\n\n\n```warn header=\"No comma between class methods\"\nA common pitfall for novice developers is to put a comma between class methods, which would result in a syntax error.\n\nThe notation here is not to be confused with object literals. Within the class, no commas are required.\n```\n\n## What is a class?\n\nSo, what exactly is a `class`? That's not an entirely new language-level entity, as one might think.\n\nLet's unveil any magic and see what a class really is. That'll help in understanding many complex aspects.\n\nIn JavaScript, a class is a kind of function.\n\nHere, take a look:\n\n```js run\nclass User {\n  constructor(name) { this.name = name; }\n  sayHi() { alert(this.name); }\n}\n\n// proof: User is a function\n*!*\nalert(typeof User); // function\n*/!*\n```\n\nWhat `class User {...}` construct really does is:\n\n1. Creates a function named `User`, that becomes the result of the class declaration. The function code is taken from the `constructor` method (assumed empty if we don't write such method).\n2. Stores class methods, such as `sayHi`, in `User.prototype`.\n\nAfter `new User` object is created, when we call its method, it's taken from the prototype, just as described in the chapter <info:function-prototype>. So the object has access to class methods.\n\nWe can illustrate the result of `class User` declaration as:\n\n![](class-user.svg)\n\nHere's the code to introspect it:\n\n```js run\nclass User {\n  constructor(name) { this.name = name; }\n  sayHi() { alert(this.name); }\n}\n\n// class is a function\nalert(typeof User); // function\n\n// ...or, more precisely, the constructor method\nalert(User === User.prototype.constructor); // true\n\n// The methods are in User.prototype, e.g:\nalert(User.prototype.sayHi); // alert(this.name);\n\n// there are exactly two methods in the prototype\nalert(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(User.prototype)); // constructor, sayHi\n```\n\n## Not just a syntactic sugar\n\nSometimes people say that `class` is a \"syntactic sugar\" (syntax that is designed to make things easier to read, but doesn't introduce anything new), because we could actually declare the same without `class` keyword at all:\n\n```js run\n// rewriting class User in pure functions\n\n// 1. Create constructor function\nfunction User(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\n// a function prototype has \"constructor\" property by default,\n// so we don't need to create it\n\n// 2. Add the method to prototype\nUser.prototype.sayHi = function() {\n  alert(this.name);\n};\n\n// Usage:\nlet user = new User(\"John\");\nuser.sayHi();\n```\n\nThe result of this definition is about the same. So, there are indeed reasons why `class` can be considered a syntactic sugar to define a constructor together with its prototype methods.\n\nStill, there are important differences.\n\n1. First, a function created by `class` is labelled by a special internal property `[[FunctionKind]]:\"classConstructor\"`. So it's not entirely the same as creating it manually.\n\n    The language checks for that property in a variety of places. For example, unlike a regular function, it must be called with `new`:\n\n    ```js run\n    class User {\n      constructor() {}\n    }\n\n    alert(typeof User); // function\n    User(); // Error: Class constructor User cannot be invoked without 'new'\n    ```\n\n    Also, a string representation of a class constructor in most JavaScript engines starts with the \"class...\"\n\n    ```js run\n    class User {\n      constructor() {}\n    }\n\n    alert(User); // class User { ... }\n    ```\n    There are other differences, we'll see them soon.\n\n2. Class methods are non-enumerable.\n    A class definition sets `enumerable` flag to `false` for all methods in the `\"prototype\"`.\n\n    That's good, because if we `for..in` over an object, we usually don't want its class methods.\n\n3. Classes always `use strict`.\n    All code inside the class construct is automatically in strict mode.\n\nBesides, `class` syntax brings many other features that we'll explore later.\n\n## Class Expression\n\nJust like functions, classes can be defined inside another expression, passed around, returned, assigned, etc.\n\nHere's an example of a class expression:\n\n```js\nlet User = class {\n  sayHi() {\n    alert(\"Hello\");\n  }\n};\n```\n\nSimilar to Named Function Expressions, class expressions may have a name.\n\nIf a class expression has a name, it's visible inside the class only:\n\n```js run\n// \"Named Class Expression\"\n// (no such term in the spec, but that's similar to Named Function Expression)\nlet User = class *!*MyClass*/!* {\n  sayHi() {\n    alert(MyClass); // MyClass name is visible only inside the class\n  }\n};\n\nnew User().sayHi(); // works, shows MyClass definition\n\nalert(MyClass); // error, MyClass name isn't visible outside of the class\n```\n\nWe can even make classes dynamically \"on-demand\", like this:\n\n```js run\nfunction makeClass(phrase) {\n  // declare a class and return it\n  return class {\n    sayHi() {\n      alert(phrase);\n    };\n  };\n}\n\n// Create a new class\nlet User = makeClass(\"Hello\");\n\nnew User().sayHi(); // Hello\n```\n\n\n## Getters/setters\n\nJust like literal objects, classes may include getters/setters, computed properties etc.\n\nHere's an example for `user.name` implemented using `get/set`:\n\n```js run\nclass User {\n\n  constructor(name) {\n    // invokes the setter\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n\n*!*\n  get name() {\n*/!*\n    return this._name;\n  }\n\n*!*\n  set name(value) {\n*/!*\n    if (value.length < 4) {\n      alert(\"Name is too short.\");\n      return;\n    }\n    this._name = value;\n  }\n\n}\n\nlet user = new User(\"John\");\nalert(user.name); // John\n\nuser = new User(\"\"); // Name is too short.\n```\n\nTechnically, such class declaration works by creating getters and setters in `User.prototype`.\n\n## Computed names [...]\n\nHere's an example with a computed method name using brackets `[...]`:\n\n```js run\nclass User {\n\n*!*\n  ['say' + 'Hi']() {\n*/!*\n    alert(\"Hello\");\n  }\n\n}\n\nnew User().sayHi();\n```\n\nSuch features are easy to remember, as they resemble that of literal objects.\n\n## Class fields\n\n```warn header=\"Old browsers may need a polyfill\"\nClass fields are a recent addition to the language.\n```\n\nPreviously, our classes only had methods.\n\n\"Class fields\" is a syntax that allows to add any properties.\n\nFor instance, let's add `name` property to `class User`:\n\n```js run\nclass User {\n*!*\n  name = \"John\";\n*/!*\n\n  sayHi() {\n    alert(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);\n  }\n}\n\nnew User().sayHi(); // Hello, John!\n```\n\nSo, we just write \"<property name> = <value>\" in the declaration, and that's it.\n\nThe important difference of class fields is that they are set on individual objects, not `User.prototype`:\n\n```js run\nclass User {\n*!*\n  name = \"John\";\n*/!*\n}\n\nlet user = new User();\nalert(user.name); // John\nalert(User.prototype.name); // undefined\n```\n\nTechnically, they are processed after the constructor has done it's job, and we can use for them complex expressions and function calls:\n\n```js run\nclass User {\n*!*\n  name = prompt(\"Name, please?\", \"John\");\n*/!*\n}\n\nlet user = new User();\nalert(user.name); // John\n```\n\n### Making bound methods with class fields\n\nAs demonstrated in the chapter <info:bind> functions in JavaScript have a dynamic `this`. It depends on the context of the call.\n\nSo if an object method is passed around and called in another context, `this` won't be a reference to its object any more.\n\nFor instance, this code will show `undefined`:\n\n```js run\nclass Button {\n  constructor(value) {\n    this.value = value;\n  }\n\n  click() {\n    alert(this.value);\n  }\n}\n\nlet button = new Button(\"hello\");\n\n*!*\nsetTimeout(button.click, 1000); // undefined\n*/!*\n```\n\nThe problem is called \"losing `this`\".\n\nThere are two approaches to fixing it, as discussed in the chapter <info:bind>:\n\n1. Pass a wrapper-function, such as `setTimeout(() => button.click(), 1000)`.\n2. Bind the method to object, e.g. in the constructor:\n\n```js run\nclass Button {\n  constructor(value) {\n    this.value = value;\n*!*\n    this.click = this.click.bind(this);\n*/!*\n  }\n\n  click() {\n    alert(this.value);\n  }\n}\n\nlet button = new Button(\"hello\");\n\n*!*\nsetTimeout(button.click, 1000); // hello\n*/!*\n```\n\nClass fields provide a more elegant syntax for the latter solution:\n\n```js run\nclass Button {\n  constructor(value) {\n    this.value = value;\n  }\n*!*\n  click = () => {\n    alert(this.value);\n  }\n*/!*\n}\n\nlet button = new Button(\"hello\");\n\nsetTimeout(button.click, 1000); // hello\n```\n\nThe class field `click = () => {...}` creates an independent function on each `Button` object, with `this` bound to the object. Then we can pass `button.click` around anywhere, and it will be called with the right `this`.\n\nThat's especially useful in browser environment, when we need to setup a method as an event listener.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe basic class syntax looks like this:\n\n```js\nclass MyClass {\n  prop = value; // property\n\n  constructor(...) { // constructor\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  method(...) {} // method\n\n  get something(...) {} // getter method\n  set something(...) {} // setter method\n\n  [Symbol.iterator]() {} // method with computed name (symbol here)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n`MyClass` is technically a function (the one that we provide as `constructor`), while methods, getters and setters are written to `MyClass.prototype`.\n\nIn the next chapters we'll learn more about classes, including inheritance and other features.",

        "content": "\n\nClass inheritance is a way for one class to extend another class.\n\nSo we can create new functionality on top of the existing.\n\n## The \"extends\" keyword\n\nLet's say we have class `Animal`:\n\n```js\nclass Animal {\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.speed = 0;\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n  run(speed) {\n    this.speed = speed;\n    alert(`${this.name} runs with speed ${this.speed}.`);\n  }\n  stop() {\n    this.speed = 0;\n    alert(`${this.name} stands still.`);\n  }\n}\n\nlet animal = new Animal(\"My animal\");\n```\n\nHere's how we can represent `animal` object and `Animal` class graphically:\n\n![](rabbit-animal-independent-animal.svg)\n\n...And we would like to create another `class Rabbit`.\n\nAs rabbits are animals, `Rabbit` class should be based on `Animal`, have access to animal methods, so that rabbits can do what \"generic\" animals can do.\n\nThe syntax to extend another class is: `class Child extends Parent`.\n\nLet's create `class Rabbit` that inherits from `Animal`:\n\n```js\n*!*\nclass Rabbit extends Animal {\n*/!*\n  hide() {\n    alert(`${this.name} hides!`);\n  }\n}\n\nlet rabbit = new Rabbit(\"White Rabbit\");\n\nrabbit.run(5); // White Rabbit runs with speed 5.\nrabbit.hide(); // White Rabbit hides!\n```\n\nObject of `Rabbit` class have access to both `Rabbit` methods, such as `rabbit.hide()`, and also to `Animal` methods, such as `rabbit.run()`.\n\nInternally, `extends` keyword works using the good old prototype mechanics. It sets `Rabbit.prototype.[[Prototype]]` to `Animal.prototype`. So, if a method is not found in `Rabbit.prototype`, JavaScript takes it from `Animal.prototype`.\n\n![](animal-rabbit-extends.svg)\n\nFor instance, to find `rabbit.run` method, the engine checks (bottom-up on the picture):\n1. The `rabbit` object (has no `run`).\n2. Its prototype, that is `Rabbit.prototype` (has `hide`, but not `run`).\n3. Its prototype, that is (due to `extends`) `Animal.prototype`, that finally has the `run` method.\n\nAs we can recall from the chapter <info:native-prototypes>, JavaScript itself uses prototypal inheritance for built-in objects. E.g. `Date.prototype.[[Prototype]]` is `Object.prototype`. That's why dates have access to generic object methods.\n\n````smart header=\"Any expression is allowed after `extends`\"\nClass syntax allows to specify not just a class, but any expression after `extends`.\n\nFor instance, a function call that generates the parent class:\n\n```js run\nfunction f(phrase) {\n  return class {\n    sayHi() { alert(phrase) }\n  }\n}\n\n*!*\nclass User extends f(\"Hello\") {}\n*/!*\n\nnew User().sayHi(); // Hello\n```\nHere `class User` inherits from the result of `f(\"Hello\")`.\n\nThat may be useful for advanced programming patterns when we use functions to generate classes depending on many conditions and can inherit from them.\n````\n\n## Overriding a method\n\nNow let's move forward and override a method. By default, all methods that are not specified in `class Rabbit` are taken directly \"as is\" from `class Animal`.\n\nBut if we specify our own method in `Rabbit`, such as `stop()` then it will be used instead:\n\n```js\nclass Rabbit extends Animal {\n  stop() {\n    // ...now this will be used for rabbit.stop()\n    // instead of stop() from class Animal\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUsually we don't want to totally replace a parent method, but rather to build on top of it to tweak or extend its functionality. We do something in our method, but call the parent method before/after it or in the process.\n\nClasses provide `\"super\"` keyword for that.\n\n- `super.method(...)` to call a parent method.\n- `super(...)` to call a parent constructor (inside our constructor only).\n\nFor instance, let our rabbit autohide when stopped:\n\n```js run\nclass Animal {\n\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.speed = 0;\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n\n  run(speed) {\n    this.speed = speed;\n    alert(`${this.name} runs with speed ${this.speed}.`);\n  }\n\n  stop() {\n    this.speed = 0;\n    alert(`${this.name} stands still.`);\n  }\n\n}\n\nclass Rabbit extends Animal {\n  hide() {\n    alert(`${this.name} hides!`);\n  }\n\n*!*\n  stop() {\n    super.stop(); // call parent stop\n    this.hide(); // and then hide\n  }\n*/!*\n}\n\nlet rabbit = new Rabbit(\"White Rabbit\");\n\nrabbit.run(5); // White Rabbit runs with speed 5.\nrabbit.stop(); // White Rabbit stands still. White rabbit hides!\n```\n\nNow `Rabbit` has the `stop` method that calls the parent `super.stop()` in the process.\n\n````smart header=\"Arrow functions have no `super`\"\nAs was mentioned in the chapter <info:arrow-functions>, arrow functions do not have `super`.\n\nIf accessed, it's taken from the outer function. For instance:\n```js\nclass Rabbit extends Animal {\n  stop() {\n    setTimeout(() => super.stop(), 1000); // call parent stop after 1sec\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `super` in the arrow function is the same as in `stop()`, so it works as intended. If we specified a \"regular\" function here, there would be an error:\n\n```js\n// Unexpected super\nsetTimeout(function() { super.stop() }, 1000);\n```\n````\n\n\n## Overriding constructor\n\nWith constructors it gets a little bit tricky.\n\nUntil now, `Rabbit` did not have its own `constructor`.\n\nAccording to the [specification](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-runtime-semantics-classdefinitionevaluation), if a class extends another class and has no `constructor`, then the following \"empty\" `constructor` is generated:\n\n```js\nclass Rabbit extends Animal {\n  // generated for extending classes without own constructors\n*!*\n  constructor(...args) {\n    super(...args);\n  }\n*/!*\n}\n```\n\nAs we can see, it basically calls the parent `constructor` passing it all the arguments. That happens if we don't write a constructor of our own.\n\nNow let's add a custom constructor to `Rabbit`. It will specify the `earLength` in addition to `name`:\n\n```js run\nclass Animal {\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.speed = 0;\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n\nclass Rabbit extends Animal {\n\n*!*\n  constructor(name, earLength) {\n    this.speed = 0;\n    this.name = name;\n    this.earLength = earLength;\n  }\n*/!*\n\n  // ...\n}\n\n*!*\n// Doesn't work!\nlet rabbit = new Rabbit(\"White Rabbit\", 10); // Error: this is not defined.\n*/!*\n```\n\nWhoops! We've got an error. Now we can't create rabbits. What went wrong?\n\nThe short answer is: constructors in inheriting classes must call `super(...)`, and (!) do it before using `this`.\n\n...But why? What's going on here? Indeed, the requirement seems strange.\n\nOf course, there's an explanation. Let's get into details, so you'll really understand what's going on.\n\nIn JavaScript, there's a distinction between a constructor function of an inheriting class (so-called \"derived constructor\") and other functions. A derived constructor has a special internal property `[[ConstructorKind]]:\"derived\"`. That's a special internal label.\n\nThat label affects its behavior with `new`.\n\n- When a regular function is executed with `new`, it creates an empty object and assigns it to `this`.\n- But when a derived constructor runs, it doesn't do this. It expects the parent constructor to do this job.\n\nSo a derived constructor must call `super` in order to execute its parent (non-derived) constructor, otherwise the object for `this` won't be created. And we'll get an error.\n\nFor the `Rabbit` constructor to work, it needs to call `super()` before using `this`, like here:\n\n```js run\nclass Animal {\n\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.speed = 0;\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n\n  // ...\n}\n\nclass Rabbit extends Animal {\n\n  constructor(name, earLength) {\n*!*\n    super(name);\n*/!*\n    this.earLength = earLength;\n  }\n\n  // ...\n}\n\n*!*\n// now fine\nlet rabbit = new Rabbit(\"White Rabbit\", 10);\nalert(rabbit.name); // White Rabbit\nalert(rabbit.earLength); // 10\n*/!*\n```\n\n\n## Super: internals, [[HomeObject]]\n\n```warn header=\"Advanced information\"\nIf you're reading the tutorial for the first time - this section may be skipped.\n\nIt's about the internal mechanisms behind inheritance and `super`.\n```\n\nLet's get a little deeper under the hood of `super`. We'll see some interesting things along the way.\n\nFirst to say, from all that we've learned till now, it's impossible for `super` to work at all!\n\nYeah, indeed, let's ask ourselves, how it should technically work? When an object method runs, it gets the current object as `this`. If we call `super.method()` then, the engine needs to get the `method` from the prototype of the current object. But how?\n\nThe task may seem simple, but it isn't. The engine knows the current object `this`, so it could get the parent `method` as `this.__proto__.method`. Unfortunately, such a \"naive\" solution won't work.\n\nLet's demonstrate the problem. Without classes, using plain objects for the sake of simplicity.\n\nYou may skip this part and go below to the `[[HomeObject]]` subsection if you don't want to know the details. That won't harm. Or read on if you're interested in understanding things in-depth.\n\nIn the example below, `rabbit.__proto__ = animal`. Now let's try: in `rabbit.eat()` we'll call `animal.eat()`, using `this.__proto__`:\n\n```js run\nlet animal = {\n  name: \"Animal\",\n  eat() {\n    alert(`${this.name} eats.`);\n  }\n};\n\nlet rabbit = {\n  __proto__: animal,\n  name: \"Rabbit\",\n  eat() {\n*!*\n    // that's how super.eat() could presumably work\n    this.__proto__.eat.call(this); // (*)\n*/!*\n  }\n};\n\nrabbit.eat(); // Rabbit eats.\n```\n\nAt the line `(*)` we take `eat` from the prototype (`animal`) and call it in the context of the current object. Please note that `.call(this)` is important here, because a simple `this.__proto__.eat()` would execute parent `eat` in the context of the prototype, not the current object.\n\nAnd in the code above it actually works as intended: we have the correct `alert`.\n\nNow let's add one more object to the chain. We'll see how things break:\n\n```js run\nlet animal = {\n  name: \"Animal\",\n  eat() {\n    alert(`${this.name} eats.`);\n  }\n};\n\nlet rabbit = {\n  __proto__: animal,\n  eat() {\n    // ...bounce around rabbit-style and call parent (animal) method\n    this.__proto__.eat.call(this); // (*)\n  }\n};\n\nlet longEar = {\n  __proto__: rabbit,\n  eat() {\n    // ...do something with long ears and call parent (rabbit) method\n    this.__proto__.eat.call(this); // (**)\n  }\n};\n\n*!*\nlongEar.eat(); // Error: Maximum call stack size exceeded\n*/!*\n```\n\nThe code doesn't work anymore! We can see the error trying to call `longEar.eat()`.\n\nIt may be not that obvious, but if we trace `longEar.eat()` call, then we can see why. In both lines `(*)` and `(**)` the value of `this` is the current object (`longEar`). That's essential: all object methods get the current object as `this`, not a prototype or something.\n\nSo, in both lines `(*)` and `(**)` the value of `this.__proto__` is exactly the same: `rabbit`. They both call `rabbit.eat` without going up the chain in the endless loop.\n\nHere's the picture of what happens:\n\n![](this-super-loop.svg)\n\n1. Inside `longEar.eat()`, the line `(**)` calls `rabbit.eat` providing it with `this=longEar`.\n    ```js\n    // inside longEar.eat() we have this = longEar\n    this.__proto__.eat.call(this) // (**)\n    // becomes\n    longEar.__proto__.eat.call(this)\n    // that is\n    rabbit.eat.call(this);\n    ```\n2. Then in the line `(*)` of `rabbit.eat`, we'd like to pass the call even higher in the chain, but `this=longEar`, so `this.__proto__.eat` is again `rabbit.eat`!\n\n    ```js\n    // inside rabbit.eat() we also have this = longEar\n    this.__proto__.eat.call(this) // (*)\n    // becomes\n    longEar.__proto__.eat.call(this)\n    // or (again)\n    rabbit.eat.call(this);\n    ```\n\n3. ...So `rabbit.eat` calls itself in the endless loop, because it can't ascend any further.\n\nThe problem can't be solved by using `this` alone.\n\n### `[[HomeObject]]`\n\nTo provide the solution, JavaScript adds one more special internal property for functions: `[[HomeObject]]`.\n\nWhen a function is specified as a class or object method, its `[[HomeObject]]` property becomes that object.\n\nThen `super` uses it to resolve the parent prototype and its methods.\n\nLet's see how it works, first with plain objects:\n\n```js run\nlet animal = {\n  name: \"Animal\",\n  eat() {         // animal.eat.[[HomeObject]] == animal\n    alert(`${this.name} eats.`);\n  }\n};\n\nlet rabbit = {\n  __proto__: animal,\n  name: \"Rabbit\",\n  eat() {         // rabbit.eat.[[HomeObject]] == rabbit\n    super.eat();\n  }\n};\n\nlet longEar = {\n  __proto__: rabbit,\n  name: \"Long Ear\",\n  eat() {         // longEar.eat.[[HomeObject]] == longEar\n    super.eat();\n  }\n};\n\n*!*\n// works correctly\nlongEar.eat();  // Long Ear eats.\n*/!*\n```\n\nIt works as intended, due to `[[HomeObject]]` mechanics. A method, such as `longEar.eat`, knows its `[[HomeObject]]` and takes the parent method from its prototype. Without any use of `this`.\n\n### Methods are not \"free\"\n\nAs we've known before, generally functions are \"free\", not bound to objects in JavaScript. So they can be copied between objects and called with another `this`.\n\nThe very existence of `[[HomeObject]]` violates that principle, because methods remember their objects. `[[HomeObject]]` can't be changed, so this bond is forever.\n\nThe only place in the language where `[[HomeObject]]` is used -- is `super`. So, if a method does not use `super`, then we can still consider it free and copy between objects. But with `super` things may go wrong.\n\nHere's the demo of a wrong `super` result after copying:\n\n```js run\nlet animal = {\n  sayHi() {\n    console.log(`I'm an animal`);\n  }\n};\n\n// rabbit inherits from animal\nlet rabbit = {\n  __proto__: animal,\n  sayHi() {\n    super.sayHi();\n  }\n};\n\nlet plant = {\n  sayHi() {\n    console.log(\"I'm a plant\");\n  }\n};\n\n// tree inherits from plant\nlet tree = {\n  __proto__: plant,\n*!*\n  sayHi: rabbit.sayHi // (*)\n*/!*\n};\n\n*!*\ntree.sayHi();  // I'm an animal (?!?)\n*/!*\n```\n\nA call to `tree.sayHi()` shows \"I'm an animal\". Definitely wrong.\n\nThe reason is simple:\n- In the line `(*)`, the method `tree.sayHi` was copied from `rabbit`. Maybe we just wanted to avoid code duplication?\n- Its `[[HomeObject]]` is `rabbit`, as it was created in `rabbit`. There's no way to change `[[HomeObject]]`.\n- The code of `tree.sayHi()` has `super.sayHi()` inside. It goes up from `rabbit` and takes the method from `animal`.\n\nHere's the diagram of what happens:\n\n![](super-homeobject-wrong.svg)\n\n### Methods, not function properties\n\n`[[HomeObject]]` is defined for methods both in classes and in plain objects. But for objects, methods must be specified exactly as `method()`, not as `\"method: function()\"`.\n\nThe difference may be non-essential for us, but it's important for JavaScript.\n\nIn the example below a non-method syntax is used for comparison. `[[HomeObject]]` property is not set and the inheritance doesn't work:\n\n```js run\nlet animal = {\n  eat: function() { // intentionally writing like this instead of eat() {...\n    // ...\n  }\n};\n\nlet rabbit = {\n  __proto__: animal,\n  eat: function() {\n    super.eat();\n  }\n};\n\n*!*\nrabbit.eat();  // Error calling super (because there's no [[HomeObject]])\n*/!*\n```\n\n## Summary\n\n1. To extend a class: `class Child extends Parent`:\n    - That means `Child.prototype.__proto__` will be `Parent.prototype`, so methods are inherited.\n2. When overriding a constructor:\n    - We must call parent constructor as `super()` in `Child` constructor before using `this`.\n3. When overriding another method:\n    - We can use `super.method()` in a `Child` method to call `Parent` method.\n4. Internals:\n    - Methods remember their class/object in the internal `[[HomeObject]]` property. That's how `super` resolves parent methods.\n    - So it's not safe to copy a method with `super` from one object to another.\n\nAlso:\n- Arrow functions don't have their own `this` or `super`, so they transparently fit into the surrounding context.",

        "content": "\n\nWe can also assign a method to the class function itself, not to its `\"prototype\"`. Such methods are called *static*.\n\nIn a class, they are prepended by `static` keyword, like this:\n\n```js run\nclass User {\n*!*\n  static staticMethod() {\n*/!*\n    alert(this === User);\n  }\n}\n\nUser.staticMethod(); // true\n```\n\nThat actually does the same as assigning it as a property directly:\n\n```js run\nclass User { }\n\nUser.staticMethod = function() {\n  alert(this === User);\n};\n\nUser.staticMethod(); // true\n```\n\nThe value of `this` in `User.staticMethod()` call is the class constructor `User` itself (the \"object before dot\" rule).\n\nUsually, static methods are used to implement functions that belong to the class, but not to any particular object of it.\n\nFor instance, we have `Article` objects and need a function to compare them. A natural solution would be to add `Article.compare` method, like this:\n\n```js run\nclass Article {\n  constructor(title, date) {\n    this.title = title;\n    this.date = date;\n  }\n\n*!*\n  static compare(articleA, articleB) {\n    return articleA.date - articleB.date;\n  }\n*/!*\n}\n\n// usage\nlet articles = [\n  new Article(\"HTML\", new Date(2019, 1, 1)),\n  new Article(\"CSS\", new Date(2019, 0, 1)),\n  new Article(\"JavaScript\", new Date(2019, 11, 1))\n];\n\n*!*\narticles.sort(Article.compare);\n*/!*\n\nalert( articles[0].title ); // CSS\n```\n\nHere `Article.compare` stands \"above\" articles, as a means to compare them. It's not a method of an article, but rather of the whole class.\n\nAnother example would be a so-called \"factory\" method. Imagine, we need few ways to create an article:\n\n1. Create by given parameters (`title`, `date` etc).\n2. Create an empty article with today's date.\n3. ...or else somehow.\n\nThe first way can be implemented by the constructor. And for the second one we can make a static method of the class.\n\nLike `Article.createTodays()` here:\n\n```js run\nclass Article {\n  constructor(title, date) {\n    this.title = title;\n    this.date = date;\n  }\n\n*!*\n  static createTodays() {\n    // remember, this = Article\n    return new this(\"Today's digest\", new Date());\n  }\n*/!*\n}\n\nlet article = Article.createTodays();\n\nalert( article.title ); // Today's digest\n```\n\nNow every time we need to create a today's digest, we can call `Article.createTodays()`. Once again, that's not a method of an article, but a method of the whole class.\n\nStatic methods are also used in database-related classes to search/save/remove entries from the database, like this:\n\n```js\n// assuming Article is a special class for managing articles\n// static method to remove the article:\nArticle.remove({id: 12345});\n```\n\n## Static properties\n\n[recent browser=Chrome]\n\nStatic properties are also possible, they look like regular class properties, but prepended by `static`:\n\n```js run\nclass Article {\n  static publisher = \"Ilya Kantor\";\n}\n\nalert( Article.publisher ); // Ilya Kantor\n```\n\nThat is the same as a direct assignment to `Article`:\n\n```js\nArticle.publisher = \"Ilya Kantor\";\n```\n\n## Inheritance of static properties and methods\n\nStatic properties and methods are inherited.\n\nFor instance, `Animal.compare` and `Animal.planet` in the code below are inherited and accessible as `Rabbit.compare` and `Rabbit.planet`:\n\n```js run\nclass Animal {\n  static planet = \"Earth\";\n\n  constructor(name, speed) {\n    this.speed = speed;\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n\n  run(speed = 0) {\n    this.speed += speed;\n    alert(`${this.name} runs with speed ${this.speed}.`);\n  }\n\n*!*\n  static compare(animalA, animalB) {\n    return animalA.speed - animalB.speed;\n  }\n*/!*\n\n}\n\n// Inherit from Animal\nclass Rabbit extends Animal {\n  hide() {\n    alert(`${this.name} hides!`);\n  }\n}\n\nlet rabbits = [\n  new Rabbit(\"White Rabbit\", 10),\n  new Rabbit(\"Black Rabbit\", 5)\n];\n\n*!*\nrabbits.sort(Rabbit.compare);\n*/!*\n\nrabbits[0].run(); // Black Rabbit runs with speed 5.\n\nalert(Rabbit.planet); // Earth\n```\n\nNow when we call `Rabbit.compare`, the inherited `Animal.compare` will be called.\n\nHow does it work? Again, using prototypes. As you might have already guessed, `extends` gives `Rabbit` the `[[Prototype]]` reference to `Animal`.\n\n![](animal-rabbit-static.svg)\n\nSo, `Rabbit extends Animal` creates two `[[Prototype]]` references:\n\n1. `Rabbit` function prototypally inherits from `Animal` function.\n2. `Rabbit.prototype` prototypally inherits from `Animal.prototype`.\n\nAs a result, inheritance works both for regular and static methods.\n\nHere, let's check that by code:\n\n```js run\nclass Animal {}\nclass Rabbit extends Animal {}\n\n// for statics\nalert(Rabbit.__proto__ === Animal); // true\n\n// for regular methods\nalert(Rabbit.prototype.__proto__ === Animal.prototype); // true\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nStatic methods are used for the functionality that belongs to the class \"as a whole\". It doesn't relate to a concrete class instance.\n\nFor example, a method for comparison `Article.compare(article1, article2)` or a factory method `Article.createTodays()`.\n\nThey are labeled by the word `static` in class declaration.\n\nStatic properties are used when we'd like to store class-level data, also not bound to an instance.\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\nclass MyClass {\n  static property = ...;\n\n  static method() {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTechnically, static declaration is the same as assigning to the class itself:\n\n```js\nMyClass.property = ...\nMyClass.method = ...\n```\n\nStatic properties and methods are inherited.\n\nFor `class B extends A` the prototype of the class `B` itself points to `A`: `B.[[Prototype]] = A`. So if a field is not found in `B`, the search continues in `A`.",

        "solution": "First, let's see why the latter code doesn't work.\n\nThe reason becomes obvious if we try to run it. An inheriting class constructor must call `super()`. Otherwise `\"this\"` won't be \"defined\".\n\nSo here's the fix:\n\n```js run\nclass Rabbit extends Object {\n  constructor(name) {\n*!*\n    super(); // need to call the parent constructor when inheriting\n*/!*\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n}\n\nlet rabbit = new Rabbit(\"Rab\");\n\nalert( rabbit.hasOwnProperty('name') ); // true\n```\n\nBut that's not all yet.\n\nEven after the fix, there's still important difference in `\"class Rabbit extends Object\"` versus `class Rabbit`.\n\nAs we know, the \"extends\" syntax sets up two prototypes:\n\n1. Between `\"prototype\"` of the constructor functions (for methods).\n2. Between the constructor functions themselves (for static methods).\n\nIn our case, for `class Rabbit extends Object` it means:\n\n```js run\nclass Rabbit extends Object {}\n\nalert( Rabbit.prototype.__proto__ === Object.prototype ); // (1) true\nalert( Rabbit.__proto__ === Object ); // (2) true\n```\n\nSo `Rabbit` now provides access to static methods of `Object` via `Rabbit`, like this:\n\n```js run\nclass Rabbit extends Object {}\n\n*!*\n// normally we call Object.getOwnPropertyNames\nalert ( Rabbit.getOwnPropertyNames({a: 1, b: 2})); // a,b\n*/!*\n```\n\nBut if we don't have `extends Object`, then `Rabbit.__proto__` is not set to `Object`.\n\nHere's the demo:\n\n```js run\nclass Rabbit {}\n\nalert( Rabbit.prototype.__proto__ === Object.prototype ); // (1) true\nalert( Rabbit.__proto__ === Object ); // (2) false (!)\nalert( Rabbit.__proto__ === Function.prototype ); // as any function by default\n\n*!*\n// error, no such function in Rabbit\nalert ( Rabbit.getOwnPropertyNames({a: 1, b: 2})); // Error\n*/!*\n```\n\nSo `Rabbit` doesn't provide access to static methods of `Object` in that case.\n\nBy the way, `Function.prototype` has \"generic\" function methods, like `call`, `bind` etc. They are ultimately available in both cases, because for the built-in `Object` constructor, `Object.__proto__ === Function.prototype`.\n\nHere's the picture:\n\n![](rabbit-extends-object.svg)\n\nSo, to put it short, there are two differences:\n\n| class Rabbit | class Rabbit extends Object  |\n|--------------|------------------------------|\n| --             | needs to call `super()` in constructor |\n| `Rabbit.__proto__ === Function.prototype` | `Rabbit.__proto__ === Object` |",

        "content": "\n\nOne of the most important principles of object oriented programming -- delimiting internal interface from the external one.\n\nThat is \"a must\" practice in developing anything more complex than a \"hello world\" app.\n\nTo understand this, let's break away from development and turn our eyes into the real world.\n\nUsually, devices that we're using are quite complex. But delimiting the internal interface from the external one allows to use them without problems.\n\n## A real-life example\n\nFor instance, a coffee machine. Simple from outside: a button, a display, a few holes...And, surely, the result -- great coffee! :)\n\n![](coffee.jpg)\n\nBut inside... (a picture from the repair manual)\n\n![](coffee-inside.jpg)\n\nA lot of details. But we can use it without knowing anything.\n\nCoffee machines are quite reliable, aren't they? We can use one for years, and only if something goes wrong -- bring it for repairs.\n\nThe secret of reliability and simplicity of a coffee machine -- all details are well-tuned and *hidden* inside.\n\nIf we remove the protective cover from the coffee machine, then using it will be much more complex (where to press?), and dangerous (it can electrocute).\n\nAs we'll see, in programming objects are like coffee machines.\n\nBut in order to hide inner details, we'll use not a protective cover, but rather special syntax of the language and conventions.\n\n## Internal and external interface\n\nIn object-oriented programming, properties and methods are split into two groups:\n\n- *Internal interface* -- methods and properties, accessible from other methods of the class, but not from the outside.\n- *External interface* -- methods and properties, accessible also from outside the class.\n\nIf we continue the analogy with the coffee machine -- what's hidden inside: a boiler tube, heating element, and so on -- is its internal interface.\n\nAn internal interface is used for the object to work, its details use each other. For instance, a boiler tube is attached to the heating element.\n\nBut from the outside a coffee machine is closed by the protective cover, so that no one can reach those. Details are hidden and inaccessible. We can use its features via the external interface.\n\nSo, all we need to use an object is to know its external interface. We may be completely unaware how it works inside, and that's great.\n\nThat was a general introduction.\n\nIn JavaScript, there are two types of object fields (properties and methods):\n\n- Public: accessible from anywhere. They comprise the external interface. Until now we were only using public properties and methods.\n- Private: accessible only from inside the class. These are for the internal interface.\n\nIn many other languages there also exist \"protected\" fields: accessible only from inside the class and those extending it (like private, but plus access from inheriting classes). They are also useful for the internal interface. They are in a sense more widespread than private ones, because we usually want inheriting classes to gain access to them.\n\nProtected fields are not implemented in JavaScript on the language level, but in practice they are very convenient, so they are emulated.\n\nNow we'll make a coffee machine in JavaScript with all these types of properties. A coffee machine has a lot of details, we won't model them to stay simple (though we could).\n\n## Protecting \"waterAmount\"\n\nLet's make a simple coffee machine class first:\n\n```js run\nclass CoffeeMachine {\n  waterAmount = 0; // the amount of water inside\n\n  constructor(power) {\n    this.power = power;\n    alert( `Created a coffee-machine, power: ${power}` );\n  }\n\n}\n\n// create the coffee machine\nlet coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine(100);\n\n// add water\ncoffeeMachine.waterAmount = 200;\n```\n\nRight now the properties `waterAmount` and `power` are public. We can easily get/set them from the outside to any value.\n\nLet's change `waterAmount` property to protected to have more control over it. For instance, we don't want anyone to set it below zero.\n\n**Protected properties are usually prefixed with an underscore `_`.**\n\nThat is not enforced on the language level, but there's a well-known convention between programmers that such properties and methods should not be accessed from the outside.\n\nSo our property will be called `_waterAmount`:\n\n```js run\nclass CoffeeMachine {\n  _waterAmount = 0;\n\n  set waterAmount(value) {\n    if (value < 0) throw new Error(\"Negative water\");\n    this._waterAmount = value;\n  }\n\n  get waterAmount() {\n    return this._waterAmount;\n  }\n\n  constructor(power) {\n    this._power = power;\n  }\n\n}\n\n// create the coffee machine\nlet coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine(100);\n\n// add water\ncoffeeMachine.waterAmount = -10; // Error: Negative water\n```\n\nNow the access is under control, so setting the water below zero fails.\n\n## Read-only \"power\"\n\nFor `power` property, let's make it read-only. It sometimes happens that a property must be set at creation time only, and then never modified.\n\nThat's exactly the case for a coffee machine: power never changes.\n\nTo do so, we only need to make getter, but not the setter:\n\n```js run\nclass CoffeeMachine {\n  // ...\n\n  constructor(power) {\n    this._power = power;\n  }\n\n  get power() {\n    return this._power;\n  }\n\n}\n\n// create the coffee machine\nlet coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine(100);\n\nalert(`Power is: ${coffeeMachine.power}W`); // Power is: 100W\n\ncoffeeMachine.power = 25; // Error (no setter)\n```\n\n````smart header=\"Getter/setter functions\"\nHere we used getter/setter syntax.\n\nBut most of the time `get.../set...` functions are preferred, like this:\n\n```js\nclass CoffeeMachine {\n  _waterAmount = 0;\n\n  *!*setWaterAmount(value)*/!* {\n    if (value < 0) throw new Error(\"Negative water\");\n    this._waterAmount = value;\n  }\n\n  *!*getWaterAmount()*/!* {\n    return this._waterAmount;\n  }\n}\n\nnew CoffeeMachine().setWaterAmount(100);\n```\n\nThat looks a bit longer, but functions are more flexible. They can accept multiple arguments (even if we don't need them right now).\n\nOn the other hand, get/set syntax is shorter, so ultimately there's no strict rule, it's up to you to decide.\n````\n\n```smart header=\"Protected fields are inherited\"\nIf we inherit `class MegaMachine extends CoffeeMachine`, then nothing prevents us from accessing `this._waterAmount` or `this._power` from the methods of the new class.\n\nSo protected fields are naturally inheritable. Unlike private ones that we'll see below.\n```\n\n## Private \"#waterLimit\"\n\n[recent browser=none]\n\nThere's a finished JavaScript proposal, almost in the standard, that provides language-level support for private properties and methods.\n\nPrivates should start with `#`. They are only accessible from inside the class.\n\nFor instance, here's a private `#waterLimit` property and the water-checking private method `#checkWater`:\n\n```js run\nclass CoffeeMachine {\n*!*\n  #waterLimit = 200;\n*/!*\n\n*!*\n  #checkWater(value) {\n    if (value < 0) throw new Error(\"Negative water\");\n    if (value > this.#waterLimit) throw new Error(\"Too much water\");\n  }\n*/!*\n\n}\n\nlet coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine();\n\n*!*\n// can't access privates from outside of the class\ncoffeeMachine.#checkWater(); // Error\ncoffeeMachine.#waterLimit = 1000; // Error\n*/!*\n```\n\nOn the language level, `#` is a special sign that the field is private. We can't access it from outside or from inheriting classes.\n\nPrivate fields do not conflict with public ones. We can have both private `#waterAmount` and public `waterAmount` fields at the same time.\n\nFor instance, let's make `waterAmount` an accessor for `#waterAmount`:\n\n```js run\nclass CoffeeMachine {\n\n  #waterAmount = 0;\n\n  get waterAmount() {\n    return this.#waterAmount;\n  }\n\n  set waterAmount(value) {\n    if (value < 0) throw new Error(\"Negative water\");\n    this.#waterAmount = value;\n  }\n}\n\nlet machine = new CoffeeMachine();\n\nmachine.waterAmount = 100;\nalert(machine.#waterAmount); // Error\n```\n\nUnlike protected ones, private fields are enforced by the language itself. That's a good thing.\n\nBut if we inherit from `CoffeeMachine`, then we'll have no direct access to `#waterAmount`. We'll need to rely on `waterAmount` getter/setter:\n\n```js\nclass MegaCoffeeMachine extends CoffeeMachine {\n  method() {\n*!*\n    alert( this.#waterAmount ); // Error: can only access from CoffeeMachine\n*/!*\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn many scenarios such limitation is too severe. If we extend a `CoffeeMachine`, we may have legitimate reasons to access its internals. That's why protected fields are used more often, even though they are not supported by the language syntax.\n\n````warn header=\"Private fields are not available as this[name]\"\nPrivate fields are special.\n\nAs we know, usually we can access fields using `this[name]`:\n\n```js\nclass User {\n  ...\n  sayHi() {\n    let fieldName = \"name\";\n    alert(`Hello, ${*!*this[fieldName]*/!*}`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith private fields that's impossible: `this['#name']` doesn't work. That's a syntax limitation to ensure privacy.\n````\n\n## Summary\n\nIn terms of OOP, delimiting of the internal interface from the external one is called [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)).\n\nIt gives the following benefits:\n\nProtection for users, so that they don't shoot themselves in the foot\n: Imagine, there's a team of developers using a coffee machine. It was made by the \"Best CoffeeMachine\" company, and works fine, but a protective cover was removed. So the internal interface is exposed.\n\n    All developers are civilized -- they use the coffee machine as intended. But one of them, John, decided that he's the smartest one, and made some tweaks in the coffee machine internals. So the coffee machine failed two days later.\n\n    That's surely not John's fault, but rather the person who removed the protective cover and let John do his manipulations.\n\n    The same in programming. If a user of a class will change things not intended to be changed from the outside -- the consequences are unpredictable.\n\nSupportable\n: The situation in programming is more complex than with a real-life coffee machine, because we don't just buy it once. The code constantly undergoes development and improvement.\n\n    **If we strictly delimit the internal interface, then the developer of the class can freely change its internal properties and methods, even without informing the users.**\n\n    If you're a developer of such class, it's great to know that private methods can be safely renamed, their parameters can be changed, and even removed, because no external code depends on them.\n\n    For users, when a new version comes out, it may be a total overhaul internally, but still simple to upgrade if the external interface is the same.\n\nHiding complexity\n: People adore using things that are simple. At least from outside. What's inside is a different thing.\n\n    Programmers are not an exception.\n\n    **It's always convenient when implementation details are hidden, and a simple, well-documented external interface is available.**\n\nTo hide an internal interface we use either protected or private properties:\n\n- Protected fields start with `_`. That's a well-known convention, not enforced at the language level. Programmers should only access a field starting with `_` from its class and classes inheriting from it.\n- Private fields start with `#`. JavaScript makes sure we can only access those from inside the class.\n\nRight now, private fields are not well-supported among browsers, but can be polyfilled.",

        "content": "\n\nBuilt-in classes like Array, Map and others are extendable also.\n\nFor instance, here `PowerArray` inherits from the native `Array`:\n\n```js run\n// add one more method to it (can do more)\nclass PowerArray extends Array {\n  isEmpty() {\n    return this.length === 0;\n  }\n}\n\nlet arr = new PowerArray(1, 2, 5, 10, 50);\nalert(arr.isEmpty()); // false\n\nlet filteredArr = arr.filter(item => item >= 10);\nalert(filteredArr); // 10, 50\nalert(filteredArr.isEmpty()); // false\n```\n\nPlease note a very interesting thing. Built-in methods like `filter`, `map` and others -- return new objects of exactly the inherited type `PowerArray`. Their internal implementation uses the object's `constructor` property for that.\n\nIn the example above,\n```js\narr.constructor === PowerArray\n```\n\nWhen `arr.filter()` is called, it internally creates the new array of results using exactly `arr.constructor`, not basic `Array`. That's actually very cool, because we can keep using `PowerArray` methods further on the result.\n\nEven more, we can customize that behavior.\n\nWe can add a special static getter `Symbol.species` to the class. If it exists, it should return the constructor that JavaScript will use internally to create new entities in `map`, `filter` and so on.\n\nIf we'd like built-in methods like `map` or `filter` to return regular arrays, we can return `Array` in `Symbol.species`, like here:\n\n```js run\nclass PowerArray extends Array {\n  isEmpty() {\n    return this.length === 0;\n  }\n\n*!*\n  // built-in methods will use this as the constructor\n  static get [Symbol.species]() {\n    return Array;\n  }\n*/!*\n}\n\nlet arr = new PowerArray(1, 2, 5, 10, 50);\nalert(arr.isEmpty()); // false\n\n// filter creates new array using arr.constructor[Symbol.species] as constructor\nlet filteredArr = arr.filter(item => item >= 10);\n\n*!*\n// filteredArr is not PowerArray, but Array\n*/!*\nalert(filteredArr.isEmpty()); // Error: filteredArr.isEmpty is not a function\n```\n\nAs you can see, now `.filter` returns `Array`. So the extended functionality is not passed any further.\n\n```smart header=\"Other collections work similarly\"\nOther collections, such as `Map` and `Set`, work alike. They also use `Symbol.species`.\n```\n\n## No static inheritance in built-ins\n\nBuilt-in objects have their own static methods, for instance `Object.keys`, `Array.isArray` etc.\n\nAs we already know, native classes extend each other. For instance, `Array` extends `Object`.\n\nNormally, when one class extends another, both static and non-static methods are inherited. That was thoroughly explained in the article [](info:static-properties-methods#statics-and-inheritance).\n\nBut built-in classes are an exception. They don't inherit statics from each other.\n\nFor example, both `Array` and `Date` inherit from `Object`, so their instances have methods from `Object.prototype`. But `Array.[[Prototype]]` does not reference `Object`, so there's no, for instance, `Array.keys()` (or `Date.keys()`) static method.\n\nHere's the picture structure for `Date` and `Object`:\n\n![](object-date-inheritance.svg)\n\nAs you can see, there's no link between `Date` and `Object`. They are independent, only `Date.prototype` inherits from `Object.prototype`.\n\nThat's an important difference of inheritance between built-in objects compared to what we get with `extends`.",

        "weight": 6,
        "content": "\n\nThe `instanceof` operator allows to check whether an object belongs to a certain class. It also takes inheritance into account.\n\nSuch a check may be necessary in many cases. Here we'll use it for building a *polymorphic* function, the one that treats arguments differently depending on their type.\n\n## The instanceof operator [#ref-instanceof]\n\nThe syntax is:\n```js\nobj instanceof Class\n```\n\nIt returns `true` if `obj` belongs to the `Class` or a class inheriting from it.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nclass Rabbit {}\nlet rabbit = new Rabbit();\n\n// is it an object of Rabbit class?\n*!*\nalert( rabbit instanceof Rabbit ); // true\n*/!*\n```\n\nIt also works with constructor functions:\n\n```js run\n*!*\n// instead of class\nfunction Rabbit() {}\n*/!*\n\nalert( new Rabbit() instanceof Rabbit ); // true\n```\n\n...And with built-in classes like `Array`:\n\n```js run\nlet arr = [1, 2, 3];\nalert( arr instanceof Array ); // true\nalert( arr instanceof Object ); // true\n```\n\nPlease note that `arr` also belongs to the `Object` class. That's because `Array` prototypically inherits from `Object`.\n\nNormally, `instanceof` examines the prototype chain for the check. We can also set a custom logic in the static method `Symbol.hasInstance`.\n\nThe algorithm of `obj instanceof Class` works roughly as follows:\n\n1. If there's a static method `Symbol.hasInstance`, then just call it: `Class[Symbol.hasInstance](obj)`. It should return either `true` or `false`, and we're done. That's how we can customize the behavior of `instanceof`.\n\n    For example:\n\n    ```js run\n    // setup instanceOf check that assumes that\n    // anything with canEat property is an animal\n    class Animal {\n      static [Symbol.hasInstance](obj) {\n        if (obj.canEat) return true;\n      }\n    }\n\n    let obj = { canEat: true };\n\n    alert(obj instanceof Animal); // true: Animal[Symbol.hasInstance](obj) is called\n    ```\n\n2. Most classes do not have `Symbol.hasInstance`. In that case, the standard logic is used: `obj instanceOf Class` checks whether `Class.prototype` is equal to one of the prototypes in the `obj` prototype chain.\n\n    In other words, compare one after another:\n    ```js\n    obj.__proto__ === Class.prototype?\n    obj.__proto__.__proto__ === Class.prototype?\n    obj.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__ === Class.prototype?\n    ...\n    // if any answer is true, return true\n    // otherwise, if we reached the end of the chain, return false\n    ```\n\n    In the example above `rabbit.__proto__ === Rabbit.prototype`, so that gives the answer immediately.\n\n    In the case of an inheritance, the match will be at the second step:\n\n    ```js run\n    class Animal {}\n    class Rabbit extends Animal {}\n\n    let rabbit = new Rabbit();\n    *!*\n    alert(rabbit instanceof Animal); // true\n    */!*\n\n    // rabbit.__proto__ === Rabbit.prototype\n    *!*\n    // rabbit.__proto__.__proto__ === Animal.prototype (match!)\n    */!*\n    ```\n\nHere's the illustration of what `rabbit instanceof Animal` compares with `Animal.prototype`:\n\n![](instanceof.svg)\n\nBy the way, there's also a method [objA.isPrototypeOf(objB)](mdn:js/object/isPrototypeOf), that returns `true` if `objA` is somewhere in the chain of prototypes for `objB`. So the test of `obj instanceof Class` can be rephrased as `Class.prototype.isPrototypeOf(obj)`.\n\nIt's funny, but the `Class` constructor itself does not participate in the check! Only the chain of prototypes and `Class.prototype` matters.\n\nThat can lead to interesting consequences when a `prototype` property is changed after the object is created.\n\nLike here:\n\n```js run\nfunction Rabbit() {}\nlet rabbit = new Rabbit();\n\n// changed the prototype\nRabbit.prototype = {};\n\n// ...not a rabbit any more!\n*!*\nalert( rabbit instanceof Rabbit ); // false\n*/!*\n```\n\n## Bonus: Object.prototype.toString for the type\n\nWe already know that plain objects are converted to string as `[object Object]`:\n\n```js run\nlet obj = {};\n\nalert(obj); // [object Object]\nalert(obj.toString()); // the same\n```\n\nThat's their implementation of `toString`. But there's a hidden feature that makes `toString` actually much more powerful than that. We can use it as an extended `typeof` and an alternative for `instanceof`.\n\nSounds strange? Indeed. Let's demystify.\n\nBy [specification](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-object.prototype.tostring), the built-in `toString` can be extracted from the object and executed in the context of any other value. And its result depends on that value.\n\n- For a number, it will be `[object Number]`\n- For a boolean, it will be `[object Boolean]`\n- For `null`: `[object Null]`\n- For `undefined`: `[object Undefined]`\n- For arrays: `[object Array]`\n- ...etc (customizable).\n\nLet's demonstrate:\n\n```js run\n// copy toString method into a variable for convenience\nlet objectToString = Object.prototype.toString;\n\n// what type is this?\nlet arr = [];\n\nalert( objectToString.call(arr) ); // [object *!*Array*/!*]\n```\n\nHere we used [call](mdn:js/function/call) as described in the chapter [](info:call-apply-decorators) to execute the function `objectToString` in the context `this=arr`.\n\nInternally, the `toString` algorithm examines `this` and returns the corresponding result. More examples:\n\n```js run\nlet s = Object.prototype.toString;\n\nalert( s.call(123) ); // [object Number]\nalert( s.call(null) ); // [object Null]\nalert( s.call(alert) ); // [object Function]\n```\n\n### Symbol.toStringTag\n\nThe behavior of Object `toString` can be customized using a special object property `Symbol.toStringTag`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  [Symbol.toStringTag]: \"User\"\n};\n\nalert( {}.toString.call(user) ); // [object User]\n```\n\nFor most environment-specific objects, there is such a property. Here are some browser specific examples:\n\n```js run\n// toStringTag for the environment-specific object and class:\nalert( window[Symbol.toStringTag]); // window\nalert( XMLHttpRequest.prototype[Symbol.toStringTag] ); // XMLHttpRequest\n\nalert( {}.toString.call(window) ); // [object Window]\nalert( {}.toString.call(new XMLHttpRequest()) ); // [object XMLHttpRequest]\n```\n\nAs you can see, the result is exactly `Symbol.toStringTag` (if exists), wrapped into `[object ...]`.\n\nAt the end we have \"typeof on steroids\" that not only works for primitive data types, but also for built-in objects and even can be customized.\n\nWe can use `{}.toString.call` instead of `instanceof` for built-in objects when we want to get the type as a string rather than just to check.\n\n## Summary\n\nLet's summarize the type-checking methods that we know:\n\n|               | works for   |  returns      |\n|---------------|-------------|---------------|\n| `typeof`      | primitives  |  string       |\n| `{}.toString` | primitives, built-in objects, objects with `Symbol.toStringTag`   |       string |\n| `instanceof`  | objects     |  true/false   |\n\nAs we can see, `{}.toString` is technically a \"more advanced\" `typeof`.\n\nAnd `instanceof` operator really shines when we are working with a class hierarchy and want to check for the class taking into account inheritance.",

        "content": "\n\nIn JavaScript we can only inherit from a single object. There can be only one `[[Prototype]]` for an object. And a class may extend only one other class.\n\nBut sometimes that feels limiting. For instance, we have a class `StreetSweeper` and a class `Bicycle`, and want to make their mix: a `StreetSweepingBicycle`.\n\nOr we have a class `User` and a class `EventEmitter` that implements event generation, and we'd like to add the functionality of `EventEmitter` to `User`, so that our users can emit events.\n\nThere's a concept that can help here, called \"mixins\".\n\nAs defined in Wikipedia, a [mixin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin) is a class containing methods that can be used by other classes without a need to inherit from it.\n\nIn other words, a *mixin* provides methods that implement a certain behavior, but we do not use it alone, we use it to add the behavior to other classes.\n\n## A mixin example\n\nThe simplest way to implement a mixin in JavaScript is to make an object with useful methods, so that we can easily merge them into a prototype of any class.\n\nFor instance here the mixin `sayHiMixin` is used to add some \"speech\" for `User`:\n\n```js run\n*!*\n// mixin\n*/!*\nlet sayHiMixin = {\n  sayHi() {\n    alert(`Hello ${this.name}`);\n  },\n  sayBye() {\n    alert(`Bye ${this.name}`);\n  }\n};\n\n*!*\n// usage:\n*/!*\nclass User {\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n}\n\n// copy the methods\nObject.assign(User.prototype, sayHiMixin);\n\n// now User can say hi\nnew User(\"Dude\").sayHi(); // Hello Dude!\n```\n\nThere's no inheritance, but a simple method copying. So `User` may inherit from another class and also include the mixin to \"mix-in\" the additional methods, like this:\n\n```js\nclass User extends Person {\n  // ...\n}\n\nObject.assign(User.prototype, sayHiMixin);\n```\n\nMixins can make use of inheritance inside themselves.\n\nFor instance, here `sayHiMixin` inherits from `sayMixin`:\n\n```js run\nlet sayMixin = {\n  say(phrase) {\n    alert(phrase);\n  }\n};\n\nlet sayHiMixin = {\n  __proto__: sayMixin, // (or we could use Object.create to set the prototype here)\n\n  sayHi() {\n    *!*\n    // call parent method\n    */!*\n    super.say(`Hello ${this.name}`); // (*)\n  },\n  sayBye() {\n    super.say(`Bye ${this.name}`); // (*)\n  }\n};\n\nclass User {\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n}\n\n// copy the methods\nObject.assign(User.prototype, sayHiMixin);\n\n// now User can say hi\nnew User(\"Dude\").sayHi(); // Hello Dude!\n```\n\nPlease note that the call to the parent method `super.say()` from `sayHiMixin` (at lines labelled with `(*)`) looks for the method in the prototype of that mixin, not the class.\n\nHere's the diagram (see the right part):\n\n![](mixin-inheritance.svg)\n\nThat's because methods `sayHi` and `sayBye` were initially created in `sayHiMixin`. So even though they got copied, their `[[HomeObject]]` internal property references `sayHiMixin`, as shown in the picture above.\n\nAs `super` looks for parent methods in `[[HomeObject]].[[Prototype]]`, that means it searches `sayHiMixin.[[Prototype]]`, not `User.[[Prototype]]`.\n\n## EventMixin\n\nNow let's make a mixin for real life.\n\nAn important feature of many browser objects (for instance) is that they can generate events. Events are a great way to \"broadcast information\" to anyone who wants it. So let's make a mixin that allows us to easily add event-related functions to any class/object.\n\n- The mixin will provide a method `.trigger(name, [...data])` to \"generate an event\" when something important happens to it. The `name` argument is a name of the event, optionally followed by additional arguments with event data.\n- Also the method `.on(name, handler)` that adds `handler` function as the listener to events with the given name. It will be called when an event with the given `name` triggers, and get the arguments from the `.trigger` call.\n- ...And the method `.off(name, handler)` that removes the `handler` listener.\n\nAfter adding the mixin, an object `user` will be able to generate an event `\"login\"` when the visitor logs in. And another object, say, `calendar` may want to listen for such events to load the calendar for the logged-in person.\n\nOr, a `menu` can generate the event `\"select\"` when a menu item is selected, and other objects may assign handlers to react on that event. And so on.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```js run\nlet eventMixin = {\n  /**\n   * Subscribe to event, usage:\n   *  menu.on('select', function(item) { ... }\n  */\n  on(eventName, handler) {\n    if (!this._eventHandlers) this._eventHandlers = {};\n    if (!this._eventHandlers[eventName]) {\n      this._eventHandlers[eventName] = [];\n    }\n    this._eventHandlers[eventName].push(handler);\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * Cancel the subscription, usage:\n   *  menu.off('select', handler)\n   */\n  off(eventName, handler) {\n    let handlers = this._eventHandlers?.[eventName];\n    if (!handlers) return;\n    for (let i = 0; i < handlers.length; i++) {\n      if (handlers[i] === handler) {\n        handlers.splice(i--, 1);\n      }\n    }\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * Generate an event with the given name and data\n   *  this.trigger('select', data1, data2);\n   */\n  trigger(eventName, ...args) {\n    if (!this._eventHandlers || !this._eventHandlers[eventName]) {\n      return; // no handlers for that event name\n    }\n\n    // call the handlers\n    this._eventHandlers[eventName].forEach(handler => handler.apply(this, args));\n  }\n};\n```\n\n\n- `.on(eventName, handler)` -- assigns function `handler` to run when the event with that name occurs. Technically, there's an `_eventHandlers` property that stores an array of handlers for each event name, and it just adds it to the list.\n- `.off(eventName, handler)` -- removes the function from the handlers list.\n- `.trigger(eventName, ...args)` -- generates the event: all handlers from `_eventHandlers[eventName]` are called, with a list of arguments `...args`.\n\nUsage:\n\n```js run\n// Make a class\nclass Menu {\n  choose(value) {\n    this.trigger(\"select\", value);\n  }\n}\n// Add the mixin with event-related methods\nObject.assign(Menu.prototype, eventMixin);\n\nlet menu = new Menu();\n\n// add a handler, to be called on selection:\n*!*\nmenu.on(\"select\", value => alert(`Value selected: ${value}`));\n*/!*\n\n// triggers the event => the handler above runs and shows:\n// Value selected: 123\nmenu.choose(\"123\");\n```\n\nNow, if we'd like any code to react to a menu selection, we can listen for it with `menu.on(...)`.\n\nAnd `eventMixin` mixin makes it easy to add such behavior to as many classes as we'd like, without interfering with the inheritance chain.\n\n## Summary\n\n*Mixin* -- is a generic object-oriented programming term: a class that contains methods for other classes.\n\nSome other languages allow multiple inheritance. JavaScript does not support multiple inheritance, but mixins can be implemented by copying methods into prototype.\n\nWe can use mixins as a way to augment a class by adding multiple behaviors, like event-handling as we have seen above.\n\nMixins may become a point of conflict if they accidentally overwrite existing class methods. So generally one should think well about the naming methods of a mixin, to minimize the probability of that happening.",

        "content": "\n\nNo matter how great we are at programming, sometimes our scripts have errors. They may occur because of our mistakes, an unexpected user input, an erroneous server response, and for a thousand other reasons.\n\nUsually, a script \"dies\" (immediately stops) in case of an error, printing it to console.\n\nBut there's a syntax construct `try..catch` that allows us to \"catch\" errors so the script can, instead of dying, do something more reasonable.\n\n## The \"try..catch\" syntax\n\nThe `try..catch` construct has two main blocks: `try`, and then `catch`:\n\n```js\ntry {\n\n  // code...\n\n} catch (err) {\n\n  // error handling\n\n}\n```\n\nIt works like this:\n\n1. First, the code in `try {...}` is executed.\n2. If there were no errors, then `catch(err)` is ignored: the execution reaches the end of `try` and goes on, skipping `catch`.\n3. If an error occurs, then the `try` execution is stopped, and control flows to the beginning of `catch(err)`. The `err` variable (we can use any name for it) will contain an error object with details about what happened.\n\n![](try-catch-flow.svg)\n\nSo, an error inside the `try {…}` block does not kill the script -- we have a chance to handle it in `catch`.\n\nLet's look at some examples.\n\n- An errorless example: shows `alert` `(1)` and `(2)`:\n\n    ```js run\n    try {\n\n      alert('Start of try runs');  // *!*(1) <--*/!*\n\n      // ...no errors here\n\n      alert('End of try runs');   // *!*(2) <--*/!*\n\n    } catch(err) {\n\n      alert('Catch is ignored, because there are no errors'); // (3)\n\n    }\n    ```\n- An example with an error: shows `(1)` and `(3)`:\n\n    ```js run\n    try {\n\n      alert('Start of try runs');  // *!*(1) <--*/!*\n\n    *!*\n      lalala; // error, variable is not defined!\n    */!*\n\n      alert('End of try (never reached)');  // (2)\n\n    } catch(err) {\n\n      alert(`Error has occurred!`); // *!*(3) <--*/!*\n\n    }\n    ```\n\n\n````warn header=\"`try..catch` only works for runtime errors\"\nFor `try..catch` to work, the code must be runnable. In other words, it should be valid JavaScript.\n\nIt won't work if the code is syntactically wrong, for instance it has unmatched curly braces:\n\n```js run\ntry {\n  {{{{{{{{{{{{\n} catch(e) {\n  alert(\"The engine can't understand this code, it's invalid\");\n}\n```\n\nThe JavaScript engine first reads the code, and then runs it. The errors that occur on the reading phase are called \"parse-time\" errors and are unrecoverable (from inside that code). That's because the engine can't understand the code.\n\nSo, `try..catch` can only handle errors that occur in valid code. Such errors are called \"runtime errors\" or, sometimes, \"exceptions\".\n````\n\n\n````warn header=\"`try..catch` works synchronously\"\nIf an exception happens in \"scheduled\" code, like in `setTimeout`, then `try..catch` won't catch it:\n\n```js run\ntry {\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    noSuchVariable; // script will die here\n  }, 1000);\n} catch (e) {\n  alert( \"won't work\" );\n}\n```\n\nThat's because the function itself is executed later, when the engine has already left the `try..catch` construct.\n\nTo catch an exception inside a scheduled function, `try..catch` must be inside that function:\n```js run\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  try {    \n    noSuchVariable; // try..catch handles the error!\n  } catch {\n    alert( \"error is caught here!\" );\n  }\n}, 1000);\n```\n````\n\n## Error object\n\nWhen an error occurs, JavaScript generates an object containing the details about it. The object is then passed as an argument to `catch`:\n\n```js\ntry {\n  // ...\n} catch(err) { // <-- the \"error object\", could use another word instead of err\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nFor all built-in errors, the error object has two main properties:\n\n`name`\n: Error name. For instance, for an undefined variable that's `\"ReferenceError\"`.\n\n`message`\n: Textual message about error details.\n\nThere are other non-standard properties available in most environments. One of most widely used and supported is:\n\n`stack`\n: Current call stack: a string with information about the sequence of nested calls that led to the error. Used for debugging purposes.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run untrusted\ntry {\n*!*\n  lalala; // error, variable is not defined!\n*/!*\n} catch(err) {\n  alert(err.name); // ReferenceError\n  alert(err.message); // lalala is not defined\n  alert(err.stack); // ReferenceError: lalala is not defined at (...call stack)\n\n  // Can also show an error as a whole\n  // The error is converted to string as \"name: message\"\n  alert(err); // ReferenceError: lalala is not defined\n}\n```\n\n## Optional \"catch\" binding\n\n[recent browser=new]\n\nIf we don't need error details, `catch` may omit it:\n\n```js\ntry {\n  // ...\n} catch { // <-- without (err)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n## Using \"try..catch\"\n\nLet's explore a real-life use case of `try..catch`.\n\nAs we already know, JavaScript supports the [JSON.parse(str)](mdn:js/JSON/parse) method to read JSON-encoded values.\n\nUsually it's used to decode data received over the network, from the server or another source.\n\nWe receive it and call `JSON.parse` like this:\n\n```js run\nlet json = '{\"name\":\"John\", \"age\": 30}'; // data from the server\n\n*!*\nlet user = JSON.parse(json); // convert the text representation to JS object\n*/!*\n\n// now user is an object with properties from the string\nalert( user.name ); // John\nalert( user.age );  // 30\n```\n\nYou can find more detailed information about JSON in the <info:json> chapter.\n\n**If `json` is malformed, `JSON.parse` generates an error, so the script \"dies\".**\n\nShould we be satisfied with that? Of course not!\n\nThis way, if something's wrong with the data, the visitor will never know that (unless they open the developer console). And people really don't like when something \"just dies\" without any error message.\n\nLet's use `try..catch` to handle the error:\n\n```js run\nlet json = \"{ bad json }\";\n\ntry {\n\n*!*\n  let user = JSON.parse(json); // <-- when an error occurs...\n*/!*\n  alert( user.name ); // doesn't work\n\n} catch (e) {\n*!*\n  // ...the execution jumps here\n  alert( \"Our apologies, the data has errors, we'll try to request it one more time.\" );\n  alert( e.name );\n  alert( e.message );\n*/!*\n}\n```\n\nHere we use the `catch` block only to show the message, but we can do much more: send a new network request, suggest an alternative to the visitor, send information about the error to a logging facility, ... . All much better than just dying.\n\n## Throwing our own errors\n\nWhat if `json` is syntactically correct, but doesn't have a required `name` property?\n\nLike this:\n\n```js run\nlet json = '{ \"age\": 30 }'; // incomplete data\n\ntry {\n\n  let user = JSON.parse(json); // <-- no errors\n*!*\n  alert( user.name ); // no name!\n*/!*\n\n} catch (e) {\n  alert( \"doesn't execute\" );\n}\n```\n\nHere `JSON.parse` runs normally, but the absence of `name` is actually an error for us.\n\nTo unify error handling, we'll use the `throw` operator.\n\n### \"Throw\" operator\n\nThe `throw` operator generates an error.\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\nthrow <error object>\n```\n\nTechnically, we can use anything as an error object. That may be even a primitive, like a number or a string, but it's better to use objects, preferably with `name` and `message` properties (to stay somewhat compatible with built-in errors).\n\nJavaScript has many built-in constructors for standard errors: `Error`, `SyntaxError`, `ReferenceError`, `TypeError` and others. We can use them to create error objects as well.\n\nTheir syntax is:\n\n```js\nlet error = new Error(message);\n// or\nlet error = new SyntaxError(message);\nlet error = new ReferenceError(message);\n// ...\n```\n\nFor built-in errors (not for any objects, just for errors), the `name` property is exactly the name of the constructor. And `message` is taken from the argument.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet error = new Error(\"Things happen o_O\");\n\nalert(error.name); // Error\nalert(error.message); // Things happen o_O\n```\n\nLet's see what kind of error `JSON.parse` generates:\n\n```js run\ntry {\n  JSON.parse(\"{ bad json o_O }\");\n} catch(e) {\n*!*\n  alert(e.name); // SyntaxError\n*/!*\n  alert(e.message); // Unexpected token b in JSON at position 2\n}\n```\n\nAs we can see, that's a `SyntaxError`.\n\nAnd in our case, the absence of `name` is an error, as users must have a `name`.\n\nSo let's throw it:\n\n```js run\nlet json = '{ \"age\": 30 }'; // incomplete data\n\ntry {\n\n  let user = JSON.parse(json); // <-- no errors\n\n  if (!user.name) {\n*!*\n    throw new SyntaxError(\"Incomplete data: no name\"); // (*)\n*/!*\n  }\n\n  alert( user.name );\n\n} catch(e) {\n  alert( \"JSON Error: \" + e.message ); // JSON Error: Incomplete data: no name\n}\n```\n\nIn the line `(*)`, the `throw` operator generates a `SyntaxError` with the given `message`, the same way as JavaScript would generate it itself. The execution of `try` immediately stops and the control flow jumps into `catch`.\n\nNow `catch` became a single place for all error handling: both for `JSON.parse` and other cases.\n\n## Rethrowing\n\nIn the example above we use `try..catch` to handle incorrect data. But is it possible that *another unexpected error* occurs within the `try {...}` block? Like a programming error (variable is not defined) or something else, not just this \"incorrect data\" thing.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nlet json = '{ \"age\": 30 }'; // incomplete data\n\ntry {\n  user = JSON.parse(json); // <-- forgot to put \"let\" before user\n\n  // ...\n} catch(err) {\n  alert(\"JSON Error: \" + err); // JSON Error: ReferenceError: user is not defined\n  // (no JSON Error actually)\n}\n```\n\nOf course, everything's possible! Programmers do make mistakes. Even in open-source utilities used by millions for decades -- suddenly a bug may be discovered that leads to terrible hacks.\n\nIn our case, `try..catch` is placed to catch \"incorrect data\" errors. But by its nature, `catch` gets *all* errors from `try`. Here it gets an unexpected error, but still shows the same `\"JSON Error\"` message. That's wrong and also makes the code more difficult to debug.\n\nTo avoid such problems, we can employ the \"rethrowing\" technique. The rule is simple:\n\n**Catch should only process errors that it knows and \"rethrow\" all others.**\n\nThe \"rethrowing\" technique can be explained in more detail as:\n\n1. Catch gets all errors.\n2. In the `catch(err) {...}` block we analyze the error object `err`.\n2. If we don't know how to handle it, we do `throw err`.\n\nUsually, we can check the error type using the `instanceof` operator:\n\n```js run\ntry {\n  user = { /*...*/ };\n} catch(err) {\n*!*\n  if (err instanceof ReferenceError) {\n*/!*\n    alert('ReferenceError'); // \"ReferenceError\" for accessing an undefined variable\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe can also get the error class name from `err.name` property. All native errors have it. Another option is to read `err.constructor.name`.\n\nIn the code below, we use rethrowing so that `catch` only handles `SyntaxError`:\n\n```js run\nlet json = '{ \"age\": 30 }'; // incomplete data\ntry {\n\n  let user = JSON.parse(json);\n\n  if (!user.name) {\n    throw new SyntaxError(\"Incomplete data: no name\");\n  }\n\n*!*\n  blabla(); // unexpected error\n*/!*\n\n  alert( user.name );\n\n} catch(e) {\n\n*!*\n  if (e instanceof SyntaxError) {\n    alert( \"JSON Error: \" + e.message );\n  } else {\n    throw e; // rethrow (*)\n  }\n*/!*\n\n}\n```\n\nThe error throwing on line `(*)` from inside `catch` block \"falls out\" of `try..catch` and can be either caught by an outer `try..catch` construct (if it exists), or it kills the script.\n\nSo the `catch` block actually handles only errors that it knows how to deal with and \"skips\" all others.\n\nThe example below demonstrates how such errors can be caught by one more level of `try..catch`:\n\n```js run\nfunction readData() {\n  let json = '{ \"age\": 30 }';\n\n  try {\n    // ...\n*!*\n    blabla(); // error!\n*/!*\n  } catch (e) {\n    // ...\n    if (!(e instanceof SyntaxError)) {\n*!*\n      throw e; // rethrow (don't know how to deal with it)\n*/!*\n    }\n  }\n}\n\ntry {\n  readData();\n} catch (e) {\n*!*\n  alert( \"External catch got: \" + e ); // caught it!\n*/!*\n}\n```\n\nHere `readData` only knows how to handle `SyntaxError`, while the outer `try..catch` knows how to handle everything.\n\n## try..catch..finally\n\nWait, that's not all.\n\nThe `try..catch` construct may have one more code clause: `finally`.\n\nIf it exists, it runs in all cases:\n\n- after `try`, if there were no errors,\n- after `catch`, if there were errors.\n\nThe extended syntax looks like this:\n\n```js\n*!*try*/!* {\n   ... try to execute the code ...\n} *!*catch*/!*(e) {\n   ... handle errors ...\n} *!*finally*/!* {\n   ... execute always ...\n}\n```\n\nTry running this code:\n\n```js run\ntry {\n  alert( 'try' );\n  if (confirm('Make an error?')) BAD_CODE();\n} catch (e) {\n  alert( 'catch' );\n} finally {\n  alert( 'finally' );\n}\n```\n\nThe code has two ways of execution:\n\n1. If you answer \"Yes\" to \"Make an error?\", then `try -> catch -> finally`.\n2. If you say \"No\", then `try -> finally`.\n\nThe `finally` clause is often used when we start doing something and want to finalize it in any case of outcome.\n\nFor instance, we want to measure the time that a Fibonacci numbers function `fib(n)` takes. Naturally, we can start measuring before it runs and finish afterwards. But what if there's an error during the function call? In particular, the implementation of `fib(n)` in the code below returns an error for negative or non-integer numbers.\n\nThe `finally` clause is a great place to finish the measurements no matter what.\n\nHere `finally` guarantees that the time will be measured correctly in both situations -- in case of a successful execution of `fib` and in case of an error in it:\n\n```js run\nlet num = +prompt(\"Enter a positive integer number?\", 35)\n\nlet diff, result;\n\nfunction fib(n) {\n  if (n < 0 || Math.trunc(n) != n) {\n    throw new Error(\"Must not be negative, and also an integer.\");\n  }\n  return n <= 1 ? n : fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);\n}\n\nlet start = Date.now();\n\ntry {\n  result = fib(num);\n} catch (e) {\n  result = 0;\n*!*\n} finally {\n  diff = Date.now() - start;\n}\n*/!*\n\nalert(result || \"error occurred\");\n\nalert( `execution took ${diff}ms` );\n```\n\nYou can check by running the code with entering `35` into `prompt` -- it executes normally, `finally` after `try`. And then enter `-1` -- there will be an immediate error, and the execution will take `0ms`. Both measurements are done correctly.\n\nIn other words, the function may finish with `return` or `throw`, that doesn't matter. The `finally` clause executes in both cases.\n\n\n```smart header=\"Variables are local inside `try..catch..finally`\"\nPlease note that `result` and `diff` variables in the code above are declared *before* `try..catch`.\n\nOtherwise, if we declared `let` in `try` block, it would only be visible inside of it.\n```\n\n````smart header=\"`finally` and `return`\"\nThe `finally` clause works for *any* exit from `try..catch`. That includes an explicit `return`.\n\nIn the example below, there's a `return` in `try`. In this case, `finally` is executed just before the control returns to the outer code.\n\n```js run\nfunction func() {\n\n  try {\n*!*\n    return 1;\n*/!*\n\n  } catch (e) {\n    /* ... */\n  } finally {\n*!*\n    alert( 'finally' );\n*/!*\n  }\n}\n\nalert( func() ); // first works alert from finally, and then this one\n```\n````\n\n````smart header=\"`try..finally`\"\n\nThe `try..finally` construct, without `catch` clause, is also useful. We apply it when we don't want to handle errors here (let them fall through), but want to be sure that processes that we started are finalized.\n\n```js\nfunction func() {\n  // start doing something that needs completion (like measurements)\n  try {\n    // ...\n  } finally {\n    // complete that thing even if all dies\n  }\n}\n```\nIn the code above, an error inside `try` always falls out, because there's no `catch`. But `finally` works before the execution flow leaves the function.\n````\n\n## Global catch\n\n```warn header=\"Environment-specific\"\nThe information from this section is not a part of the core JavaScript.\n```\n\nLet's imagine we've got a fatal error outside of `try..catch`, and the script died. Like a programming error or some other terrible thing.\n\nIs there a way to react on such occurrences? We may want to log the error, show something to the user (normally they don't see error messages), etc.\n\nThere is none in the specification, but environments usually provide it, because it's really useful. For instance, Node.js has [`process.on(\"uncaughtException\")`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_event_uncaughtexception) for that. And in the browser we can assign a function to the special [window.onerror](mdn:api/GlobalEventHandlers/onerror) property, that will run in case of an uncaught error.\n\nThe syntax:\n\n```js\nwindow.onerror = function(message, url, line, col, error) {\n  // ...\n};\n```\n\n`message`\n: Error message.\n\n`url`\n: URL of the script where error happened.\n\n`line`, `col`\n: Line and column numbers where error happened.\n\n`error`\n: Error object.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run untrusted refresh height=1\n<script>\n*!*\n  window.onerror = function(message, url, line, col, error) {\n    alert(`${message}\\n At ${line}:${col} of ${url}`);\n  };\n*/!*\n\n  function readData() {\n    badFunc(); // Whoops, something went wrong!\n  }\n\n  readData();\n</script>\n```\n\nThe role of the global handler `window.onerror` is usually not to recover the script execution -- that's probably impossible in case of programming errors, but to send the error message to developers.\n\nThere are also web-services that provide error-logging for such cases, like <https://errorception.com> or <http://www.muscula.com>.\n\nThey work like this:\n\n1. We register at the service and get a piece of JS (or a script URL) from them to insert on pages.\n2. That JS script sets a custom `window.onerror` function.\n3. When an error occurs, it sends a network request about it to the service.\n4. We can log in to the service web interface and see errors.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe `try..catch` construct allows to handle runtime errors. It literally allows to \"try\" running the code and \"catch\" errors that may occur in it.\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\ntry {\n  // run this code\n} catch(err) {\n  // if an error happened, then jump here\n  // err is the error object\n} finally {\n  // do in any case after try/catch\n}\n```\n\nThere may be no `catch` section or no `finally`, so shorter constructs `try..catch` and `try..finally` are also valid.\n\nError objects have following properties:\n\n- `message` -- the human-readable error message.\n- `name` -- the string with error name (error constructor name).\n- `stack` (non-standard, but well-supported) -- the stack at the moment of error creation.\n\nIf an error object is not needed, we can omit it by using `catch {` instead of `catch(err) {`.\n\nWe can also generate our own errors using the `throw` operator. Technically, the argument of `throw` can be anything, but usually it's an error object inheriting from the built-in `Error` class. More on extending errors in the next chapter.\n\n*Rethrowing* is a very important pattern of error handling: a `catch` block usually expects and knows how to handle the particular error type, so it should rethrow errors it doesn't know.\n\nEven if we don't have `try..catch`, most environments allow us to setup a \"global\" error handler to catch errors that \"fall out\". In-browser, that's `window.onerror`.",

For errors in network operations we may need `HttpError`, for database operations `DbError`, for searching operations `NotFoundError` and so on.\n\nOur errors should support basic error properties like `message`, `name` and, preferably, `stack`. But they also may have other properties of their own, e.g. `HttpError` objects may have a `statusCode` property with a value like `404` or `403` or `500`.\n\nJavaScript allows to use `throw` with any argument, so technically our custom error classes don't need to inherit from `Error`. But if we inherit, then it becomes possible to use `obj instanceof Error` to identify error objects. So it's better to inherit from it.\n\nAs the application grows, our own errors naturally form a hierarchy. For instance, `HttpTimeoutError` may inherit from `HttpError`, and so on.\n\n## Extending Error\n\nAs an example, let's consider a function `readUser(json)` that should read JSON with user data.\n\nHere's an example of how a valid `json` may look:\n```js\nlet json = `{ \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30 }`;\n```\n\nInternally, we'll use `JSON.parse`. If it receives malformed `json`, then it throws `SyntaxError`. But even if `json` is syntactically correct, that doesn't mean that it's a valid user, right? It may miss the necessary data. For instance, it may not have `name` and `age` properties that are essential for our users.\n\nOur function `readUser(json)` will not only read JSON, but check (\"validate\") the data. If there are no required fields, or the format is wrong, then that's an error. And that's not a `SyntaxError`, because the data is syntactically correct, but another kind of error. We'll call it `ValidationError` and create a class for it. An error of that kind should also carry the information about the offending field.\n\nOur `ValidationError` class should inherit from the built-in `Error` class.\n\nThat class is built-in, but here's its approximate code so we can understand what we're extending:\n\n```js\n// The \"pseudocode\" for the built-in Error class defined by JavaScript itself\nclass Error {\n  constructor(message) {\n    this.message = message;\n    this.name = \"Error\"; // (different names for different built-in error classes)\n    this.stack = <call stack>; // non-standard, but most environments support it\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow let's inherit `ValidationError` from it and try it in action:\n\n```js run untrusted\n*!*\nclass ValidationError extends Error {\n*/!*\n  constructor(message) {\n    super(message); // (1)\n    this.name = \"ValidationError\"; // (2)\n  }\n}\n\nfunction test() {\n  throw new ValidationError(\"Whoops!\");\n}\n\ntry {\n  test();\n} catch(err) {\n  alert(err.message); // Whoops!\n  alert(err.name); // ValidationError\n  alert(err.stack); // a list of nested calls with line numbers for each\n}\n```\n\nPlease note: in the line `(1)` we call the parent constructor. JavaScript requires us to call `super` in the child constructor, so that's obligatory. The parent constructor sets the `message` property.\n\nThe parent constructor also sets the `name` property to `\"Error\"`, so in the line `(2)` we reset it to the right value.\n\nLet's try to use it in `readUser(json)`:\n\n```js run\nclass ValidationError extends Error {\n  constructor(message) {\n    super(message);\n    this.name = \"ValidationError\";\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction readUser(json) {\n  let user = JSON.parse(json);\n\n  if (!user.age) {\n    throw new ValidationError(\"No field: age\");\n  }\n  if (!user.name) {\n    throw new ValidationError(\"No field: name\");\n  }\n\n  return user;\n}\n\n// Working example with try..catch\n\ntry {\n  let user = readUser('{ \"age\": 25 }');\n} catch (err) {\n  if (err instanceof ValidationError) {\n*!*\n    alert(\"Invalid data: \" + err.message); // Invalid data: No field: name\n*/!*\n  } else if (err instanceof SyntaxError) { // (*)\n    alert(\"JSON Syntax Error: \" + err.message);\n  } else {\n    throw err; // unknown error, rethrow it (**)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `try..catch` block in the code above handles both our `ValidationError` and the built-in `SyntaxError` from `JSON.parse`.\n\nPlease take a look at how we use `instanceof` to check for the specific error type in the line `(*)`.\n\nWe could also look at `err.name`, like this:\n\n```js\n// ...\n// instead of (err instanceof SyntaxError)\n} else if (err.name == \"SyntaxError\") { // (*)\n// ...\n```  \n\nThe `instanceof` version is much better, because in the future we are going to extend `ValidationError`, make subtypes of it, like `PropertyRequiredError`. And `instanceof` check will continue to work for new inheriting classes. So that's future-proof.\n\nAlso it's important that if `catch` meets an unknown error, then it rethrows it in the line `(**)`. The `catch` block only knows how to handle validation and syntax errors, other kinds (due to a typo in the code or other unknown ones) should fall through.\n\n## Further inheritance\n\nThe `ValidationError` class is very generic. Many things may go wrong. The property may be absent or it may be in a wrong format (like a string value for `age`). Let's make a more concrete class `PropertyRequiredError`, exactly for absent properties. It will carry additional information about the property that's missing.\n\n```js run\nclass ValidationError extends Error {\n  constructor(message) {\n    super(message);\n    this.name = \"ValidationError\";\n  }\n}\n\n*!*\nclass PropertyRequiredError extends ValidationError {\n  constructor(property) {\n    super(\"No property: \" + property);\n    this.name = \"PropertyRequiredError\";\n    this.property = property;\n  }\n}\n*/!*\n\n// Usage\nfunction readUser(json) {\n  let user = JSON.parse(json);\n\n  if (!user.age) {\n    throw new PropertyRequiredError(\"age\");\n  }\n  if (!user.name) {\n    throw new PropertyRequiredError(\"name\");\n  }\n\n  return user;\n}\n\n// Working example with try..catch\n\ntry {\n  let user = readUser('{ \"age\": 25 }');\n} catch (err) {\n  if (err instanceof ValidationError) {\n*!*\n    alert(\"Invalid data: \" + err.message); // Invalid data: No property: name\n    alert(err.name); // PropertyRequiredError\n    alert(err.property); // name\n*/!*\n  } else if (err instanceof SyntaxError) {\n    alert(\"JSON Syntax Error: \" + err.message);\n  } else {\n    throw err; // unknown error, rethrow it\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe new class `PropertyRequiredError` is easy to use: we only need to pass the property name: `new PropertyRequiredError(property)`. The human-readable `message` is generated by the constructor.\n\nPlease note that `this.name` in `PropertyRequiredError` constructor is again assigned manually. That may become a bit tedious -- to assign `this.name = <class name>` in every custom error class. We can avoid it by making our own \"basic error\" class that assigns `this.name = this.constructor.name`. And then inherit all our custom errors from it.\n\nLet's call it `MyError`.\n\nHere's the code with `MyError` and other custom error classes, simplified:\n\n```js run\nclass MyError extends Error {\n  constructor(message) {\n    super(message);\n*!*\n    this.name = this.constructor.name;\n*/!*\n  }\n}\n\nclass ValidationError extends MyError { }\n\nclass PropertyRequiredError extends ValidationError {\n  constructor(property) {\n    super(\"No property: \" + property);\n    this.property = property;\n  }\n}\n\n// name is correct\nalert( new PropertyRequiredError(\"field\").name ); // PropertyRequiredError\n```\n\nNow custom errors are much shorter, especially `ValidationError`, as we got rid of the `\"this.name = ...\"` line in the constructor.\n\n## Wrapping exceptions\n\nThe purpose of the function `readUser` in the code above is \"to read the user data\". There may occur different kinds of errors in the process. Right now we have `SyntaxError` and `ValidationError`, but in the future `readUser` function may grow and probably generate other kinds of errors.\n\nThe code which calls `readUser` should handle these errors. Right now it uses multiple `if`s in the `catch` block, that check the class and handle known errors and rethrow the unknown ones.\n\nThe scheme is like this:\n\n```js\ntry {\n  ...\n  readUser()  // the potential error source\n  ...\n} catch (err) {\n  if (err instanceof ValidationError) {\n    // handle validation errors\n  } else if (err instanceof SyntaxError) {\n    // handle syntax errors\n  } else {\n    throw err; // unknown error, rethrow it\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the code above we can see two types of errors, but there can be more.\n\nIf the `readUser` function generates several kinds of errors, then we should ask ourselves: do we really want to check for all error types one-by-one every time?\n\nOften the answer is \"No\": we'd like to be \"one level above all that\". We just want to know if there was a \"data reading error\" -- why exactly it happened is often irrelevant (the error message describes it). Or, even better, we'd like to have a way to get the error details, but only if we need to.\n\nThe technique that we describe here is called \"wrapping exceptions\".\n\n1. We'll make a new class `ReadError` to represent a generic \"data reading\" error.\n2. The function `readUser` will catch data reading errors that occur inside it, such as `ValidationError` and `SyntaxError`, and generate a `ReadError` instead.\n3. The `ReadError` object will keep the reference to the original error in its `cause` property.\n\nThen the code that calls `readUser` will only have to check for `ReadError`, not for every kind of data reading errors. And if it needs more details of an error, it can check its `cause` property.\n\nHere's the code that defines `ReadError` and demonstrates its use in `readUser` and `try..catch`:\n\n```js run\nclass ReadError extends Error {\n  constructor(message, cause) {\n    super(message);\n    this.cause = cause;\n    this.name = 'ReadError';\n  }\n}\n\nclass ValidationError extends Error { /*...*/ }\nclass PropertyRequiredError extends ValidationError { /* ... */ }\n\nfunction validateUser(user) {\n  if (!user.age) {\n    throw new PropertyRequiredError(\"age\");\n  }\n\n  if (!user.name) {\n    throw new PropertyRequiredError(\"name\");\n  }\n}\n\nfunction readUser(json) {\n  let user;\n\n  try {\n    user = JSON.parse(json);\n  } catch (err) {\n*!*\n    if (err instanceof SyntaxError) {\n      throw new ReadError(\"Syntax Error\", err);\n    } else {\n      throw err;\n    }\n*/!*\n  }\n\n  try {\n    validateUser(user);\n  } catch (err) {\n*!*\n    if (err instanceof ValidationError) {\n      throw new ReadError(\"Validation Error\", err);\n    } else {\n      throw err;\n    }\n*/!*\n  }\n\n}\n\ntry {\n  readUser('{bad json}');\n} catch (e) {\n  if (e instanceof ReadError) {\n*!*\n    alert(e);\n    // Original error: SyntaxError: Unexpected token b in JSON at position 1\n    alert(\"Original error: \" + e.cause);\n*/!*\n  } else {\n    throw e;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the code above, `readUser` works exactly as described -- catches syntax and validation errors and throws `ReadError` errors instead (unknown errors are rethrown as usual).\n\nSo the outer code checks `instanceof ReadError` and that's it. No need to list all possible error types.\n\nThe approach is called \"wrapping exceptions\", because we take \"low level\" exceptions and \"wrap\" them into `ReadError` that is more abstract. It is widely used in object-oriented programming.\n\n## Summary\n\n- We can inherit from `Error` and other built-in error classes normally. We just need to take care of the `name` property and don't forget to call `super`.\n- We can use `instanceof` to check for particular errors. It also works with inheritance. But sometimes we have an error object coming from a 3rd-party library and there's no easy way to get its class. Then `name` property can be used for such checks.\n- Wrapping exceptions is a widespread technique: a function handles low-level exceptions and creates higher-level errors instead of various low-level ones. Low-level exceptions sometimes become properties of that object like `err.cause` in the examples above, but that's not strictly required.",

        "content": "\n\n```warn header=\"We use browser methods in examples here\"\nTo demonstrate the use of callbacks, promises and other abstract concepts, we'll be using some browser methods: specifically, loading scripts and performing simple document manipulations.\n\nIf you're not familiar with these methods, and their usage in the examples is confusing, you may want to read a few chapters from the [next part](/document) of the tutorial.\n\nAlthough, we'll try to make things clear anyway. There won't be anything really complex browser-wise.\n```\n\nMany functions are provided by JavaScript host environments that allow you to schedule *asynchronous* actions. In other words, actions that we initiate now, but they finish later.\n\nFor instance, one such function is the `setTimeout` function.\n\nThere are other real-world examples of asynchronous actions, e.g. loading scripts and modules (we'll cover them in later chapters).\n\nTake a look at the function `loadScript(src)`, that loads a script with the given `src`:\n\n```js\nfunction loadScript(src) {\n  // creates a <script> tag and append it to the page\n  // this causes the script with given src to start loading and run when complete\n  let script = document.createElement('script');\n  script.src = src;\n  document.head.append(script);\n}\n```\n\nIt appends to the document the new, dynamically created, tag `<script src=\"…\">` with given `src`. The browser automatically starts loading it and executes when complete.\n\nWe can use this function like this:\n\n```js\n// load and execute the script at the given path\nloadScript('/my/script.js');\n```\n\nThe script is executed \"asynchronously\", as it starts loading now, but runs later, when the function has already finished.\n\nIf there's any code below `loadScript(…)`, it doesn't wait until the script loading finishes.\n\n```js\nloadScript('/my/script.js');\n// the code below loadScript\n// doesn't wait for the script loading to finish\n// ...\n```\n\nLet's say we need to use the new script as soon as it loads. It declares new functions, and we want to run them.\n\nBut if we do that immediately after the `loadScript(…)` call, that wouldn't work:\n\n```js\nloadScript('/my/script.js'); // the script has \"function newFunction() {…}\"\n\n*!*\nnewFunction(); // no such function!\n*/!*\n```\n\nNaturally, the browser probably didn't have time to load the script. As of now, the `loadScript` function doesn't provide a way to track the load completion. The script loads and eventually runs, that's all. But we'd like to know when it happens, to use new functions and variables from that script.\n\nLet's add a `callback` function as a second argument to `loadScript` that should execute when the script loads:\n\n```js\nfunction loadScript(src, *!*callback*/!*) {\n  let script = document.createElement('script');\n  script.src = src;\n\n*!*\n  script.onload = () => callback(script);\n*/!*\n\n  document.head.append(script);\n}\n```\n\nNow if we want to call new functions from the script, we should write that in the callback:\n\n```js\nloadScript('/my/script.js', function() {\n  // the callback runs after the script is loaded\n  newFunction(); // so now it works\n  ...\n});\n```\n\nThat's the idea: the second argument is a function (usually anonymous) that runs when the action is completed.\n\nHere's a runnable example with a real script:\n\n```js run\nfunction loadScript(src, callback) {\n  let script = document.createElement('script');\n  script.src = src;\n  script.onload = () => callback(script);\n  document.head.append(script);\n}\n\n*!*\nloadScript('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/3.2.0/lodash.js', script => {\n  alert(`Cool, the script ${script.src} is loaded`);\n  alert( _ ); // function declared in the loaded script\n});\n*/!*\n```\n\nThat's called a \"callback-based\" style of asynchronous programming. A function that does something asynchronously should provide a `callback` argument where we put the function to run after it's complete.\n\nHere we did it in `loadScript`, but of course it's a general approach.\n\n## Callback in callback\n\nHow can we load two scripts sequentially: the first one, and then the second one after it?\n\nThe natural solution would be to put the second `loadScript` call inside the callback, like this:\n\n```js\nloadScript('/my/script.js', function(script) {\n\n  alert(`Cool, the ${script.src} is loaded, let's load one more`);\n\n*!*\n  loadScript('/my/script2.js', function(script) {\n    alert(`Cool, the second script is loaded`);\n  });\n*/!*\n\n});\n```\n\nAfter the outer `loadScript` is complete, the callback initiates the inner one.\n\nWhat if we want one more script...?\n\n```js\nloadScript('/my/script.js', function(script) {\n\n  loadScript('/my/script2.js', function(script) {\n\n*!*\n    loadScript('/my/script3.js', function(script) {\n      // ...continue after all scripts are loaded\n    });\n*/!*\n\n  })\n\n});\n```\n\nSo, every new action is inside a callback. That's fine for few actions, but not good for many, so we'll see other variants soon.\n\n## Handling errors\n\nIn the above examples we didn't consider errors. What if the script loading fails? Our callback should be able to react on that.\n\nHere's an improved version of `loadScript` that tracks loading errors:\n\n```js\nfunction loadScript(src, callback) {\n  let script = document.createElement('script');\n  script.src = src;\n\n*!*\n  script.onload = () => callback(null, script);\n  script.onerror = () => callback(new Error(`Script load error for ${src}`));\n*/!*\n\n  document.head.append(script);\n}\n```\n\nIt calls `callback(null, script)` for successful load and `callback(error)` otherwise.\n\nThe usage:\n```js\nloadScript('/my/script.js', function(error, script) {\n  if (error) {\n    // handle error\n  } else {\n    // script loaded successfully\n  }\n});\n```\n\nOnce again, the recipe that we used for `loadScript` is actually quite common. It's called the \"error-first callback\" style.\n\nThe convention is:\n1. The first argument of the `callback` is reserved for an error if it occurs. Then `callback(err)` is called.\n2. The second argument (and the next ones if needed) are for the successful result. Then `callback(null, result1, result2…)` is called.\n\nSo the single `callback` function is used both for reporting errors and passing back results.\n\n## Pyramid of Doom\n\nFrom the first look, it's a viable way of asynchronous coding. And indeed it is. For one or maybe two nested calls it looks fine.\n\nBut for multiple asynchronous actions that follow one after another we'll have code like this:\n\n```js\nloadScript('1.js', function(error, script) {\n\n  if (error) {\n    handleError(error);\n  } else {\n    // ...\n    loadScript('2.js', function(error, script) {\n      if (error) {\n        handleError(error);\n      } else {\n        // ...\n        loadScript('3.js', function(error, script) {\n          if (error) {\n            handleError(error);\n          } else {\n  *!*\n            // ...continue after all scripts are loaded (*)\n  */!*\n          }\n        });\n\n      }\n    })\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n1. We load `1.js`, then if there's no error.\n2. We load `2.js`, then if there's no error.\n3. We load `3.js`, then if there's no error -- do something else `(*)`.\n\nAs calls become more nested, the code becomes deeper and increasingly more difficult to manage, especially if we have real code instead of `...` that may include more loops, conditional statements and so on.\n\nThat's sometimes called \"callback hell\" or \"pyramid of doom.\"\n\n<!--\nloadScript('1.js', function(error, script) {\n  if (error) {\n    handleError(error);\n  } else {\n    // ...\n    loadScript('2.js', function(error, script) {\n      if (error) {\n        handleError(error);\n      } else {\n        // ...\n        loadScript('3.js', function(error, script) {\n          if (error) {\n            handleError(error);\n          } else {\n            // ...\n          }\n        });\n      }\n    })\n  }\n});\n-->\n\n![](callback-hell.svg)\n\nThe \"pyramid\" of nested calls grows to the right with every asynchronous action. Soon it spirals out of control.\n\nSo this way of coding isn't very good.\n\nWe can try to alleviate the problem by making every action a standalone function, like this:\n\n```js\nloadScript('1.js', step1);\n\nfunction step1(error, script) {\n  if (error) {\n    handleError(error);\n  } else {\n    // ...\n    loadScript('2.js', step2);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction step2(error, script) {\n  if (error) {\n    handleError(error);\n  } else {\n    // ...\n    loadScript('3.js', step3);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction step3(error, script) {\n  if (error) {\n    handleError(error);\n  } else {\n    // ...continue after all scripts are loaded (*)\n  }\n};\n```\n\nSee? It does the same, and there's no deep nesting now because we made every action a separate top-level function.\n\nIt works, but the code looks like a torn apart spreadsheet. It's difficult to read, and you probably noticed that one needs to eye-jump between pieces while reading it. That's inconvenient, especially if the reader is not familiar with the code and doesn't know where to eye-jump.\n\nAlso, the functions named `step*` are all of single use, they are created only to avoid the \"pyramid of doom.\" No one is going to reuse them outside of the action chain. So there's a bit of namespace cluttering here.\n\nWe'd like to have something better.\n\nLuckily, there are other ways to avoid such pyramids. One of the best ways is to use \"promises,\" described in the next chapter.",

        "content": "\n\nImagine that you're a top singer, and fans ask day and night for your upcoming single.\n\nTo get some relief, you promise to send it to them when it's published. You give your fans a list. They can fill in their email addresses, so that when the song becomes available, all subscribed parties instantly receive it. And even if something goes very wrong, say, a fire in the studio, so that you can't publish the song, they will still be notified.\n\nEveryone is happy: you, because the people don't crowd you anymore, and fans, because they won't miss the single.\n\nThis is a real-life analogy for things we often have in programming:\n\n1. A \"producing code\" that does something and takes time. For instance, some code that loads the data over a network. That's a \"singer\".\n2. A \"consuming code\" that wants the result of the \"producing code\" once it's ready. Many functions  may need that result. These are the \"fans\".\n3. A *promise* is a special JavaScript object that links the \"producing code\" and the \"consuming code\" together. In terms of our analogy: this is the \"subscription list\". The \"producing code\" takes whatever time it needs to produce the promised result, and the \"promise\" makes that result available to all of the subscribed code when it's ready.\n\nThe analogy isn't terribly accurate, because JavaScript promises are more complex than a simple subscription list: they have additional features and limitations. But it's fine to begin with.\n\nThe constructor syntax for a promise object is:\n\n```js\nlet promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  // executor (the producing code, \"singer\")\n});\n```\n\nThe function passed to `new Promise` is called the *executor*. When `new Promise` is created, the executor runs automatically. It contains the producing code which should eventually produce the result. In terms of the analogy above: the executor is the \"singer\".\n\nIts arguments `resolve` and `reject` are callbacks provided by JavaScript itself. Our code is only inside the executor.\n\nWhen the executor obtains the result, be it soon or late, doesn't matter, it should call one of these callbacks:\n\n- `resolve(value)` — if the job finished successfully, with result `value`.\n- `reject(error)` — if an error occurred, `error` is the error object.\n\nSo to summarize: the executor runs automatically and attempts to perform a job. When it is finished with the attempt it calls `resolve` if it was successful or `reject` if there was an error.\n\nThe `promise` object returned by the `new Promise` constructor has these internal properties:\n\n- `state` — initially `\"pending\"`, then changes to either `\"fulfilled\"` when `resolve` is called or `\"rejected\"` when `reject` is called.\n- `result` — initially `undefined`, then changes to `value` when `resolve(value)` called or `error` when `reject(error)` is called.\n\nSo the executor eventually moves `promise` to one of these states:\n\n![](promise-resolve-reject.svg)\n\nLater we'll see how \"fans\" can subscribe to these changes.\n\nHere's an example of a promise constructor and a simple executor function with  \"producing code\" that takes time (via `setTimeout`):\n\n```js run\nlet promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  // the function is executed automatically when the promise is constructed\n\n  // after 1 second signal that the job is done with the result \"done\"\n  setTimeout(() => *!*resolve(\"done\")*/!*, 1000);\n});\n```\n\nWe can see two things by running the code above:\n\n1. The executor is called automatically and immediately (by `new Promise`).\n2. The executor receives two arguments: `resolve` and `reject`. These functions are pre-defined by the JavaScript engine, so we don't need to create them. We should only call one of them when ready.\n\n    After one second of \"processing\" the executor calls `resolve(\"done\")` to produce the result. This changes the state of the `promise` object:\n\n    ![](promise-resolve-1.svg)\n\nThat was an example of a successful job completion, a \"fulfilled promise\".\n\nAnd now an example of the executor rejecting the promise with an error:\n\n```js\nlet promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  // after 1 second signal that the job is finished with an error\n  setTimeout(() => *!*reject(new Error(\"Whoops!\"))*/!*, 1000);\n});\n```\n\nThe call to `reject(...)` moves the promise object to `\"rejected\"` state:\n\n![](promise-reject-1.svg)\n\nTo summarize, the executor should perform a job (usually something that takes time) and then call `resolve` or `reject` to change the state of the corresponding promise object.\n\nA promise that is either resolved or rejected is called \"settled\", as opposed to an initially \"pending\" promise.\n\n````smart header=\"There can be only a single result or an error\"\nThe executor should call only one `resolve` or one `reject`. Any state change is final.\n\nAll further calls of `resolve` and `reject` are ignored:\n\n```js\nlet promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n*!*\n  resolve(\"done\");\n*/!*\n\n  reject(new Error(\"…\")); // ignored\n  setTimeout(() => resolve(\"…\")); // ignored\n});\n```\n\nThe idea is that a job done by the executor may have only one result or an error.\n\nAlso, `resolve`/`reject` expect only one argument (or none) and will ignore additional arguments.\n````\n\n```smart header=\"Reject with `Error` objects\"\nIn case something goes wrong, the executor should call `reject`. That can be done with any type of argument (just like `resolve`). But it is recommended to use `Error` objects (or objects that inherit from `Error`). The reasoning for that will soon become apparent.\n```\n\n````smart header=\"Immediately calling `resolve`/`reject`\"\nIn practice, an executor usually does something asynchronously and calls `resolve`/`reject` after some time, but it doesn't have to. We also can call `resolve` or `reject` immediately, like this:\n\n```js\nlet promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  // not taking our time to do the job\n  resolve(123); // immediately give the result: 123\n});\n```\n\nFor instance, this might happen when we start to do a job but then see that everything has already been completed and cached.\n\nThat's fine. We immediately have a resolved promise.\n````\n\n```smart header=\"The `state` and `result` are internal\"\nThe properties `state` and `result` of the Promise object are internal. We can't directly access them. We can use the methods `.then`/`.catch`/`.finally` for that. They are described below.\n```\n\n## Consumers: then, catch, finally\n\nA Promise object serves as a link between the executor (the \"producing code\" or \"singer\") and the consuming functions (the \"fans\"), which will receive the result or error. Consuming functions can be registered (subscribed) using methods `.then`, `.catch` and `.finally`.\n\n### then\n\nThe most important, fundamental one is `.then`.\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\npromise.then(\n  function(result) { *!*/* handle a successful result */*/!* },\n  function(error) { *!*/* handle an error */*/!* }\n);\n```\n\nThe first argument of `.then` is a function that runs when the promise is resolved, and receives the result.\n\nThe second argument of `.then` is a function that runs when the promise is rejected, and receives the error.\n\nFor instance, here's a reaction to a successfully resolved promise:\n\n```js run\nlet promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  setTimeout(() => resolve(\"done!\"), 1000);\n});\n\n// resolve runs the first function in .then\npromise.then(\n*!*\n  result => alert(result), // shows \"done!\" after 1 second\n*/!*\n  error => alert(error) // doesn't run\n);\n```\n\nThe first function was executed.\n\nAnd in the case of a rejection, the second one:\n\n```js run\nlet promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error(\"Whoops!\")), 1000);\n});\n\n// reject runs the second function in .then\npromise.then(\n  result => alert(result), // doesn't run\n*!*\n  error => alert(error) // shows \"Error: Whoops!\" after 1 second\n*/!*\n);\n```\n\nIf we're interested only in successful completions, then we can provide only one function argument to `.then`:\n\n```js run\nlet promise = new Promise(resolve => {\n  setTimeout(() => resolve(\"done!\"), 1000);\n});\n\n*!*\npromise.then(alert); // shows \"done!\" after 1 second\n*/!*\n```\n\n### catch\n\nIf we're interested only in errors, then we can use `null` as the first argument: `.then(null, errorHandlingFunction)`. Or we can use `.catch(errorHandlingFunction)`, which is exactly the same:\n\n\n```js run\nlet promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error(\"Whoops!\")), 1000);\n});\n\n*!*\n// .catch(f) is the same as promise.then(null, f)\npromise.catch(alert); // shows \"Error: Whoops!\" after 1 second\n*/!*\n```\n\nThe call `.catch(f)` is a complete analog of `.then(null, f)`, it's just a shorthand.\n\n### finally\n\nJust like there's a `finally` clause in a regular `try {...} catch {...}`, there's `finally` in promises.\n\nThe call `.finally(f)` is similar to `.then(f, f)` in the sense that `f` always runs when the promise is settled: be it resolve or reject.\n\n`finally` is a good handler for performing cleanup, e.g. stopping our loading indicators, as they are not needed anymore, no matter what the outcome is.\n\nLike this:\n\n```js\nnew Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  /* do something that takes time, and then call resolve/reject */\n})\n*!*\n  // runs when the promise is settled, doesn't matter successfully or not\n  .finally(() => stop loading indicator)\n*/!*\n  .then(result => show result, err => show error)\n```\n\nIt's not exactly an alias of `then(f,f)` though. There are several important differences:\n\n1. A `finally` handler has no arguments. In `finally` we don't know whether the promise is successful or not. That's all right, as our task is usually to perform \"general\" finalizing procedures.\n2. A `finally` handler passes through results and errors to the next handler.\n\n    For instance, here the result is passed through `finally` to `then`:\n    ```js run\n    new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      setTimeout(() => resolve(\"result\"), 2000)\n    })\n      .finally(() => alert(\"Promise ready\"))\n      .then(result => alert(result)); // <-- .then handles the result\n    ```\n\n    And here there's an error in the promise, passed through `finally` to `catch`:\n\n    ```js run\n    new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      throw new Error(\"error\");\n    })\n      .finally(() => alert(\"Promise ready\"))\n      .catch(err => alert(err));  // <-- .catch handles the error object\n    ```\n\n    That's very convenient, because `finally` is not meant to process a promise result. So it passes it through.\n\n    We'll talk more about promise chaining and result-passing between handlers in the next chapter.\n\n3. Last, but not least, `.finally(f)` is a more convenient syntax than `.then(f, f)`: no need to duplicate the function `f`.\n\n````smart header=\"On settled promises handlers run immediately\"\nIf a promise is pending, `.then/catch/finally` handlers wait for it. Otherwise, if a promise has already settled, they execute immediately:\n\n```js run\n// the promise becomes resolved immediately upon creation\nlet promise = new Promise(resolve => resolve(\"done!\"));\n\npromise.then(alert); // done! (shows up right now)\n```\n\nNote that this is different, and more powerful than the real life \"subscription list\" scenario. If the singer has already released their song and then a person signs up on the subscription list, they probably won't receive that song. Subscriptions in real life must be done prior to the event.\n\nPromises are more flexible. We can add handlers any time: if the result is already there, our handlers get it immediately.\n````\n\nNext, let's see more practical examples of how promises can help us write asynchronous code.\n\n## Example: loadScript [#loadscript]\n\nWe've got the `loadScript` function for loading a script from the previous chapter.\n\nHere's the callback-based variant, just to remind us of it:\n\n```js\nfunction loadScript(src, callback) {\n  let script = document.createElement('script');\n  script.src = src;\n\n  script.onload = () => callback(null, script);\n  script.onerror = () => callback(new Error(`Script load error for ${src}`));\n\n  document.head.append(script);\n}\n```\n\nLet's rewrite it using Promises.\n\nThe new function `loadScript` will not require a callback. Instead, it will create and return a Promise object that resolves when the loading is complete. The outer code can add handlers (subscribing functions) to it using `.then`:\n\n```js run\nfunction loadScript(src) {\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    let script = document.createElement('script');\n    script.src = src;\n\n    script.onload = () => resolve(script);\n    script.onerror = () => reject(new Error(`Script load error for ${src}`));\n\n    document.head.append(script);\n  });\n}\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```js run\nlet promise = loadScript(\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.js\");\n\npromise.then(\n  script => alert(`${script.src} is loaded!`),\n  error => alert(`Error: ${error.message}`)\n);\n\npromise.then(script => alert('Another handler...'));\n```\n\nWe can immediately see a few benefits over the callback-based pattern:\n\n\n| Promises | Callbacks |\n|----------|-----------|\n| Promises allow us to do things in the natural order. First, we run `loadScript(script)`, and `.then` we write what to do with the result. | We must have a `callback` function at our disposal when calling `loadScript(script, callback)`. In other words, we must know what to do with the result *before* `loadScript` is called. |\n| We can call `.then` on a Promise as many times as we want. Each time, we're adding a new \"fan\", a new subscribing function, to the \"subscription list\". More about this in the next chapter: [](info:promise-chaining). | There can be only one callback. |\n\nSo promises give us better code flow and flexibility. But there's more. We'll see that in the next chapters.",

        "content": "\n\nLet's return to the problem mentioned in the chapter <info:callbacks>: we have a sequence of asynchronous tasks to be performed one after another — for instance, loading scripts. How can we code it well?\n\nPromises provide a couple of recipes to do that.\n\nIn this chapter we cover promise chaining.\n\nIt looks like this:\n\n```js run\nnew Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\n  setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000); // (*)\n\n}).then(function(result) { // (**)\n\n  alert(result); // 1\n  return result * 2;\n\n}).then(function(result) { // (***)\n\n  alert(result); // 2\n  return result * 2;\n\n}).then(function(result) {\n\n  alert(result); // 4\n  return result * 2;\n\n});\n```\n\nThe idea is that the result is passed through the chain of `.then` handlers.\n\nHere the flow is:\n1. The initial promise resolves in 1 second `(*)`,\n2. Then the `.then` handler is called `(**)`.\n3. The value that it returns is passed to the next `.then` handler `(***)`\n4. ...and so on.\n\nAs the result is passed along the chain of handlers, we can see a sequence of `alert` calls: `1` -> `2` -> `4`.\n\n![](promise-then-chain.svg)\n\nThe whole thing works, because a call to `promise.then` returns a promise, so that we can call the next `.then` on it.\n\nWhen a handler returns a value, it becomes the result of that promise, so the next `.then` is called with it.\n\n**A classic newbie error: technically we can also add many `.then` to a single promise. This is not chaining.**\n\nFor example:\n```js run\nlet promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);\n});\n\npromise.then(function(result) {\n  alert(result); // 1\n  return result * 2;\n});\n\npromise.then(function(result) {\n  alert(result); // 1\n  return result * 2;\n});\n\npromise.then(function(result) {\n  alert(result); // 1\n  return result * 2;\n});\n```\n\nWhat we did here is just several handlers to one promise. They don't pass the result to each other; instead they process it independently.\n\nHere's the picture (compare it with the chaining above):\n\n![](promise-then-many.svg)\n\nAll `.then` on the same promise get the same result -- the result of that promise. So in the code above all `alert` show the same: `1`.\n\nIn practice we rarely need multiple handlers for one promise. Chaining is used much more often.\n\n## Returning promises\n\nA handler, used in `.then(handler)` may create and return a promise.\n\nIn that case further handlers wait until it settles, and then get its result.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nnew Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\n  setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);\n\n}).then(function(result) {\n\n  alert(result); // 1\n\n*!*\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { // (*)\n    setTimeout(() => resolve(result * 2), 1000);\n  });\n*/!*\n\n}).then(function(result) { // (**)\n\n  alert(result); // 2\n\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    setTimeout(() => resolve(result * 2), 1000);\n  });\n\n}).then(function(result) {\n\n  alert(result); // 4\n\n});\n```\n\nHere the first `.then` shows `1` and returns `new Promise(…)` in the line `(*)`. After one second it resolves, and the result (the argument of `resolve`, here it's `result * 2`) is passed on to handler of the second `.then`. That handler is in the line `(**)`, it shows `2` and does the same thing.\n\nSo the output is the same as in the previous example: 1 -> 2 -> 4, but now with 1 second delay between `alert` calls.\n\nReturning promises allows us to build chains of asynchronous actions.\n\n## Example: loadScript\n\nLet's use this feature with the promisified `loadScript`, defined in the [previous chapter](info:promise-basics#loadscript), to load scripts one by one, in sequence:\n\n```js run\nloadScript(\"/article/promise-chaining/one.js\")\n  .then(function(script) {\n    return loadScript(\"/article/promise-chaining/two.js\");\n  })\n  .then(function(script) {\n    return loadScript(\"/article/promise-chaining/three.js\");\n  })\n  .then(function(script) {\n    // use functions declared in scripts\n    // to show that they indeed loaded\n    one();\n    two();\n    three();\n  });\n```\n\nThis code can be made bit shorter with arrow functions:\n\n```js run\nloadScript(\"/article/promise-chaining/one.js\")\n  .then(script => loadScript(\"/article/promise-chaining/two.js\"))\n  .then(script => loadScript(\"/article/promise-chaining/three.js\"))\n  .then(script => {\n    // scripts are loaded, we can use functions declared there\n    one();\n    two();\n    three();\n  });\n```\n\n\nHere each `loadScript` call returns a promise, and the next `.then` runs when it resolves. Then it initiates the loading of the next script. So scripts are loaded one after another.\n\nWe can add more asynchronous actions to the chain. Please note that the code is still \"flat\" — it grows down, not to the right. There are no signs of the \"pyramid of doom\".\n\nTechnically, we could add `.then` directly to each `loadScript`, like this:\n\n```js run\nloadScript(\"/article/promise-chaining/one.js\").then(script1 => {\n  loadScript(\"/article/promise-chaining/two.js\").then(script2 => {\n    loadScript(\"/article/promise-chaining/three.js\").then(script3 => {\n      // this function has access to variables script1, script2 and script3\n      one();\n      two();\n      three();\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis code does the same: loads 3 scripts in sequence. But it \"grows to the right\". So we have the same problem as with callbacks.\n\nPeople who start to use promises sometimes don't know about chaining, so they write it this way. Generally, chaining is preferred.\n\nSometimes it's ok to write `.then` directly, because the nested function has access to the outer scope. In the example above the most nested callback has access to all variables `script1`, `script2`, `script3`. But that's an exception rather than a rule.\n\n\n````smart header=\"Thenables\"\nTo be precise, a handler may return not exactly a promise, but a so-called \"thenable\" object - an arbitrary object that has a method `.then`. It will be treated the same way as a promise.\n\nThe idea is that 3rd-party libraries may implement \"promise-compatible\" objects of their own. They can have an extended set of methods, but also be compatible with native promises, because they implement `.then`.\n\nHere's an example of a thenable object:\n\n```js run\nclass Thenable {\n  constructor(num) {\n    this.num = num;\n  }\n  then(resolve, reject) {\n    alert(resolve); // function() { native code }\n    // resolve with this.num*2 after the 1 second\n    setTimeout(() => resolve(this.num * 2), 1000); // (**)\n  }\n}\n\nnew Promise(resolve => resolve(1))\n  .then(result => {\n*!*\n    return new Thenable(result); // (*)\n*/!*\n  })\n  .then(alert); // shows 2 after 1000ms\n```\n\nJavaScript checks the object returned by the `.then` handler in line `(*)`: if it has a callable method named `then`, then it calls that method providing native functions `resolve`, `reject` as arguments (similar to an executor) and waits until one of them is called. In the example above `resolve(2)` is called after 1 second `(**)`. Then the result is passed further down the chain.\n\nThis feature allows us to integrate custom objects with promise chains without having to inherit from `Promise`.\n````\n\n\n## Bigger example: fetch\n\nIn frontend programming promises are often used for network requests. So let's see an extended example of that.\n\nWe'll use the [fetch](info:fetch) method to load the information about the user from the remote server. It has a lot of optional parameters covered in [separate chapters](info:fetch), but the basic syntax is quite simple:\n\n```js\nlet promise = fetch(url);\n```\n\nThis makes a network request to the `url` and returns a promise. The promise resolves with a `response` object when the remote server responds with headers, but *before the full response is downloaded*.\n\nTo read the full response, we should call the method `response.text()`: it returns a promise that resolves when the full text is downloaded from the remote server, with that text as a result.\n\nThe code below makes a request to `user.json` and loads its text from the server:\n\n```js run\nfetch('/article/promise-chaining/user.json')\n  // .then below runs when the remote server responds\n  .then(function(response) {\n    // response.text() returns a new promise that resolves with the full response text\n    // when it loads\n    return response.text();\n  })\n  .then(function(text) {\n    // ...and here's the content of the remote file\n    alert(text); // {\"name\": \"iliakan\", \"isAdmin\": true}\n  });\n```\n\nThe `response` object returned from `fetch` also includes the method `response.json()` that reads the remote data and parses it as JSON. In our case that's even more convenient, so let's switch to it.\n\nWe'll also use arrow functions for brevity:\n\n```js run\n// same as above, but response.json() parses the remote content as JSON\nfetch('/article/promise-chaining/user.json')\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(user => alert(user.name)); // iliakan, got user name\n```\n\nNow let's do something with the loaded user.\n\nFor instance, we can make one more requests to GitHub, load the user profile and show the avatar:\n\n```js run\n// Make a request for user.json\nfetch('/article/promise-chaining/user.json')\n  // Load it as json\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  // Make a request to GitHub\n  .then(user => fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${user.name}`))\n  // Load the response as json\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  // Show the avatar image (githubUser.avatar_url) for 3 seconds (maybe animate it)\n  .then(githubUser => {\n    let img = document.createElement('img');\n    img.src = githubUser.avatar_url;\n    img.className = \"promise-avatar-example\";\n    document.body.append(img);\n\n    setTimeout(() => img.remove(), 3000); // (*)\n  });\n```\n\nThe code works; see comments about the details. However, there's a potential problem in it, a typical error for those who begin to use promises.\n\nLook at the line `(*)`: how can we do something *after* the avatar has finished showing and gets removed? For instance, we'd like to show a form for editing that user or something else. As of now, there's no way.\n\nTo make the chain extendable, we need to return a promise that resolves when the avatar finishes showing.\n\nLike this:\n\n```js run\nfetch('/article/promise-chaining/user.json')\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(user => fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${user.name}`))\n  .then(response => response.json())\n*!*\n  .then(githubUser => new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { // (*)\n*/!*\n    let img = document.createElement('img');\n    img.src = githubUser.avatar_url;\n    img.className = \"promise-avatar-example\";\n    document.body.append(img);\n\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      img.remove();\n*!*\n      resolve(githubUser); // (**)\n*/!*\n    }, 3000);\n  }))\n  // triggers after 3 seconds\n  .then(githubUser => alert(`Finished showing ${githubUser.name}`));\n```\n\nThat is, the `.then` handler in line `(*)` now returns `new Promise`, that becomes settled only after the call of `resolve(githubUser)` in `setTimeout` `(**)`. The next `.then` in the chain will wait for that.\n\nAs a good practice, an asynchronous action should always return a promise. That makes it possible to plan actions after it; even if we don't plan to extend the chain now, we may need it later.\n\nFinally, we can split the code into reusable functions:\n\n```js run\nfunction loadJson(url) {\n  return fetch(url)\n    .then(response => response.json());\n}\n\nfunction loadGithubUser(name) {\n  return fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${name}`)\n    .then(response => response.json());\n}\n\nfunction showAvatar(githubUser) {\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    let img = document.createElement('img');\n    img.src = githubUser.avatar_url;\n    img.className = \"promise-avatar-example\";\n    document.body.append(img);\n\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      img.remove();\n      resolve(githubUser);\n    }, 3000);\n  });\n}\n\n// Use them:\nloadJson('/article/promise-chaining/user.json')\n  .then(user => loadGithubUser(user.name))\n  .then(showAvatar)\n  .then(githubUser => alert(`Finished showing ${githubUser.name}`));\n  // ...\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nIf a `.then` (or `catch/finally`, doesn't matter) handler returns a promise, the rest of the chain waits until it settles. When it does, its result (or error) is passed further.\n\nHere's a full picture:\n\n![](promise-handler-variants.svg)",

        "weight": 4,
        "content": "\n\nPromise chains are great at error handling. When a promise rejects, the control jumps to the closest rejection handler. That's very convenient in practice.\n\nFor instance, in the code below the URL to `fetch` is wrong (no such site) and `.catch` handles the error:\n\n```js run\n*!*\nfetch('https://no-such-server.blabla') // rejects\n*/!*\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .catch(err => alert(err)) // TypeError: failed to fetch (the text may vary)\n```\n\nAs you can see, the `.catch` doesn't have to be immediate. It may appear after one or maybe several `.then`.\n\nOr, maybe, everything is all right with the site, but the response is not valid JSON. The easiest way to catch all errors is to append `.catch` to the end of chain:\n\n```js run\nfetch('/article/promise-chaining/user.json')\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(user => fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${user.name}`))\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(githubUser => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    let img = document.createElement('img');\n    img.src = githubUser.avatar_url;\n    img.className = \"promise-avatar-example\";\n    document.body.append(img);\n\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      img.remove();\n      resolve(githubUser);\n    }, 3000);\n  }))\n*!*\n  .catch(error => alert(error.message));\n*/!*\n```\n\nNormally, such `.catch` doesn't trigger at all. But if any of the promises above rejects (a network problem or invalid json or whatever), then it would catch it.\n\n## Implicit try..catch\n\nThe code of a promise executor and promise handlers has an \"invisible `try..catch`\" around it. If an exception happens, it gets caught and treated as a rejection.\n\nFor instance, this code:\n\n```js run\nnew Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n*!*\n  throw new Error(\"Whoops!\");\n*/!*\n}).catch(alert); // Error: Whoops!\n```\n\n...Works exactly the same as this:\n\n```js run\nnew Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n*!*\n  reject(new Error(\"Whoops!\"));\n*/!*\n}).catch(alert); // Error: Whoops!\n```\n\nThe \"invisible `try..catch`\" around the executor automatically catches the error and turns it into rejected promise.\n\nThis happens not only in the executor function, but in its handlers as well. If we `throw` inside a `.then` handler, that means a rejected promise, so the control jumps to the nearest error handler.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```js run\nnew Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  resolve(\"ok\");\n}).then((result) => {\n*!*\n  throw new Error(\"Whoops!\"); // rejects the promise\n*/!*\n}).catch(alert); // Error: Whoops!\n```\n\nThis happens for all errors, not just those caused by the `throw` statement. For example, a programming error:\n\n```js run\nnew Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  resolve(\"ok\");\n}).then((result) => {\n*!*\n  blabla(); // no such function\n*/!*\n}).catch(alert); // ReferenceError: blabla is not defined\n```\n\nThe final `.catch` not only catches explicit rejections, but also accidental errors in the handlers above.\n\n## Rethrowing\n\nAs we already noticed, `.catch` at the end of the chain is similar to `try..catch`. We may have as many `.then` handlers as we want, and then use a single `.catch` at the end to handle errors in all of them.\n\nIn a regular `try..catch` we can analyze the error and maybe rethrow it if it can't be handled. The same thing is possible for promises.\n\nIf we `throw` inside `.catch`, then the control goes to the next closest error handler. And if we handle the error and finish normally, then it continues to the next closest successful `.then` handler.\n\nIn the example below the `.catch` successfully handles the error:\n\n```js run\n// the execution: catch -> then\nnew Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n\n  throw new Error(\"Whoops!\");\n\n}).catch(function(error) {\n\n  alert(\"The error is handled, continue normally\");\n\n}).then(() => alert(\"Next successful handler runs\"));\n```\n\nHere the `.catch` block finishes normally. So the next successful `.then` handler is called.\n\nIn the example below we see the other situation with `.catch`. The handler `(*)` catches the error and just can't handle it (e.g. it only knows how to handle `URIError`), so it throws it again:\n\n```js run\n// the execution: catch -> catch -> then\nnew Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n\n  throw new Error(\"Whoops!\");\n\n}).catch(function(error) { // (*)\n\n  if (error instanceof URIError) {\n    // handle it\n  } else {\n    alert(\"Can't handle such error\");\n\n*!*\n    throw error; // throwing this or another error jumps to the next catch\n*/!*\n  }\n\n}).then(function() {\n  /* doesn't run here */\n}).catch(error => { // (**)\n\n  alert(`The unknown error has occurred: ${error}`);\n  // don't return anything => execution goes the normal way\n\n});\n```\n\nThe execution jumps from the first `.catch` `(*)` to the next one `(**)` down the chain.\n\n## Unhandled rejections\n\nWhat happens when an error is not handled? For instance, we forgot to append `.catch` to the end of the chain, like here:\n\n```js untrusted run refresh\nnew Promise(function() {\n  noSuchFunction(); // Error here (no such function)\n})\n  .then(() => {\n    // successful promise handlers, one or more\n  }); // without .catch at the end!\n```\n\nIn case of an error, the promise becomes rejected, and the execution should jump to the closest rejection handler. But there is none. So the error gets \"stuck\". There's no code to handle it.\n\nIn practice, just like with regular unhandled errors in code, it means that something has gone terribly wrong.\n\nWhat happens when a regular error occurs and is not caught by `try..catch`? The script dies with a message in the console. A similar thing happens with unhandled promise rejections.\n\nThe JavaScript engine tracks such rejections and generates a global error in that case. You can see it in the console if you run the example above.\n\nIn the browser we can catch such errors using the event `unhandledrejection`:\n\n```js run\n*!*\nwindow.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', function(event) {\n  // the event object has two special properties:\n  alert(event.promise); // [object Promise] - the promise that generated the error\n  alert(event.reason); // Error: Whoops! - the unhandled error object\n});\n*/!*\n\nnew Promise(function() {\n  throw new Error(\"Whoops!\");\n}); // no catch to handle the error\n```\n\nThe event is the part of the [HTML standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#unhandled-promise-rejections).\n\nIf an error occurs, and there's no `.catch`, the `unhandledrejection` handler triggers, and gets the `event` object with the information about the error, so we can do something.\n\nUsually such errors are unrecoverable, so our best way out is to inform the user about the problem and probably report the incident to the server.\n\nIn non-browser environments like Node.js there are other ways to track unhandled errors.\n\n## Summary\n\n- `.catch` handles errors in promises of all kinds: be it a `reject()` call, or an error thrown in a handler.\n- We should place `.catch` exactly in places where we want to handle errors and know how to handle them. The handler should analyze errors (custom error classes help) and rethrow unknown ones (maybe they are programming mistakes).\n- It's ok not to use `.catch` at all, if there's no way to recover from an error.\n- In any case we should have the `unhandledrejection` event handler (for browsers, and analogs for other environments) to track unhandled errors and inform the user (and probably our server) about them, so that our app never \"just dies\".",

        "content": "\n\nThere are 5 static methods in the `Promise` class. We'll quickly cover their use cases here.\n\n## Promise.all\n\nLet's say we want many promises to execute in parallel and wait until all of them are ready.\n\nFor instance, download several URLs in parallel and process the content once they are all done.\n\nThat's what `Promise.all` is for.\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\nlet promise = Promise.all([...promises...]);\n```\n\n`Promise.all` takes an array of promises (it technically can be any iterable, but is usually an array) and returns a new promise.\n\nThe new promise resolves when all listed promises are settled, and the array of their results becomes its result.\n\nFor instance, the `Promise.all` below settles after 3 seconds, and then its result is an array `[1, 2, 3]`:\n\n```js run\nPromise.all([\n  new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 3000)), // 1\n  new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(2), 2000)), // 2\n  new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(3), 1000))  // 3\n]).then(alert); // 1,2,3 when promises are ready: each promise contributes an array member\n```\n\nPlease note that the order of the resulting array members is the same as in its source promises. Even though the first promise takes the longest time to resolve, it's still first in the array of results.\n\nA common trick is to map an array of job data into an array of promises, and then wrap that into `Promise.all`.\n\nFor instance, if we have an array of URLs, we can fetch them all like this:\n\n```js run\nlet urls = [\n  'https://api.github.com/users/iliakan',\n  'https://api.github.com/users/remy',\n  'https://api.github.com/users/jeresig'\n];\n\n// map every url to the promise of the fetch\nlet requests = urls.map(url => fetch(url));\n\n// Promise.all waits until all jobs are resolved\nPromise.all(requests)\n  .then(responses => responses.forEach(\n    response => alert(`${response.url}: ${response.status}`)\n  ));\n```\n\nA bigger example with fetching user information for an array of GitHub users by their names (we could fetch an array of goods by their ids, the logic is identical):\n\n```js run\nlet names = ['iliakan', 'remy', 'jeresig'];\n\nlet requests = names.map(name => fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${name}`));\n\nPromise.all(requests)\n  .then(responses => {\n    // all responses are resolved successfully\n    for(let response of responses) {\n      alert(`${response.url}: ${response.status}`); // shows 200 for every url\n    }\n\n    return responses;\n  })\n  // map array of responses into an array of response.json() to read their content\n  .then(responses => Promise.all(responses.map(r => r.json())))\n  // all JSON answers are parsed: \"users\" is the array of them\n  .then(users => users.forEach(user => alert(user.name)));\n```\n\n**If any of the promises is rejected, the promise returned by `Promise.all` immediately rejects with that error.**\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nPromise.all([\n  new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000)),\n*!*\n  new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(() => reject(new Error(\"Whoops!\")), 2000)),\n*/!*\n  new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(() => resolve(3), 3000))\n]).catch(alert); // Error: Whoops!\n```\n\nHere the second promise rejects in two seconds. That leads to an immediate rejection of `Promise.all`, so `.catch` executes: the rejection error becomes the outcome of the entire `Promise.all`.\n\n```warn header=\"In case of an error, other promises are ignored\"\nIf one promise rejects, `Promise.all` immediately rejects, completely forgetting about the other ones in the list. Their results are ignored.\n\nFor example, if there are multiple `fetch` calls, like in the example above, and one fails, the others will still continue to execute, but `Promise.all` won't watch them anymore. They will probably settle, but their results will be ignored.\n\n`Promise.all` does nothing to cancel them, as there's no concept of \"cancellation\" in promises. In [another chapter](info:fetch-abort) we'll cover `AbortController` that can help with that, but it's not a part of the Promise API.\n```\n\n````smart header=\"`Promise.all(iterable)` allows non-promise \\\"regular\\\" values in `iterable`\"\nNormally, `Promise.all(...)` accepts an iterable (in most cases an array) of promises. But if any of those objects is not a promise, it's passed to the resulting array \"as is\".\n\nFor instance, here the results are `[1, 2, 3]`:\n\n```js run\nPromise.all([\n  new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000)\n  }),\n  2,\n  3\n]).then(alert); // 1, 2, 3\n```\n\nSo we are able to pass ready values to `Promise.all` where convenient.\n````\n\n## Promise.allSettled\n\n[recent browser=\"new\"]\n\n`Promise.all` rejects as a whole if any promise rejects. That's good for \"all or nothing\" cases, when we need *all* results successful to proceed:\n\n```js\nPromise.all([\n  fetch('/template.html'),\n  fetch('/style.css'),\n  fetch('/data.json')\n]).then(render); // render method needs results of all fetches\n```\n\n`Promise.allSettled` just waits for all promises to settle, regardless of the result. The resulting array has:\n\n- `{status:\"fulfilled\", value:result}` for successful responses,\n- `{status:\"rejected\", reason:error}` for errors.\n\nFor example, we'd like to fetch the information about multiple users. Even if one request fails, we're still interested in the others.\n\nLet's use `Promise.allSettled`:\n\n```js run\nlet urls = [\n  'https://api.github.com/users/iliakan',\n  'https://api.github.com/users/remy',\n  'https://no-such-url'\n];\n\nPromise.allSettled(urls.map(url => fetch(url)))\n  .then(results => { // (*)\n    results.forEach((result, num) => {\n      if (result.status == \"fulfilled\") {\n        alert(`${urls[num]}: ${result.value.status}`);\n      }\n      if (result.status == \"rejected\") {\n        alert(`${urls[num]}: ${result.reason}`);\n      }\n    });\n  });\n```\n\nThe `results` in the line `(*)` above will be:\n```js\n[\n  {status: 'fulfilled', value: ...response...},\n  {status: 'fulfilled', value: ...response...},\n  {status: 'rejected', reason: ...error object...}\n]\n```\n\nSo for each promise we get its status and `value/error`.\n\n### Polyfill\n\nIf the browser doesn't support `Promise.allSettled`, it's easy to polyfill:\n\n```js\nif(!Promise.allSettled) {\n  Promise.allSettled = function(promises) {\n    return Promise.all(promises.map(p => Promise.resolve(p).then(value => ({\n      status: 'fulfilled',\n      value\n    }), reason => ({\n      status: 'rejected',\n      reason\n    }))));\n  };\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `promises.map` takes input values, turns them into promises (just in case a non-promise was passed) with `p => Promise.resolve(p)`, and then adds `.then` handler to every one.\n\nThat handler turns a successful result `value` into `{status:'fulfilled', value}`, and an error `reason` into `{status:'rejected', reason}`. That's exactly the format of `Promise.allSettled`.\n\nNow we can use `Promise.allSettled` to get the results of *all* given promises, even if some of them reject.\n\n## Promise.race\n\nSimilar to `Promise.all`, but waits only for the first settled promise and gets its result (or error).\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\nlet promise = Promise.race(iterable);\n```\n\nFor instance, here the result will be `1`:\n\n```js run\nPromise.race([\n  new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000)),\n  new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(() => reject(new Error(\"Whoops!\")), 2000)),\n  new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(() => resolve(3), 3000))\n]).then(alert); // 1\n```\n\nThe first promise here was fastest, so it became the result. After the first settled promise \"wins the race\", all further results/errors are ignored.\n\n\n## Promise.resolve/reject\n\nMethods `Promise.resolve` and `Promise.reject` are rarely needed in modern code, because `async/await` syntax (we'll cover it [a bit later](info:async-await)) makes them somewhat obsolete.\n\nWe cover them here for completeness and for those who can't use `async/await` for some reason.\n\n### Promise.resolve\n\n`Promise.resolve(value)` creates a resolved promise with the result `value`.\n\nSame as:\n\n```js\nlet promise = new Promise(resolve => resolve(value));\n```\n\nThe method is used for compatibility, when a function is expected to return a promise.\n\nFor example, the `loadCached` function below fetches a URL and remembers (caches) its content. For future calls with the same URL it immediately gets the previous content from cache, but uses `Promise.resolve` to make a promise of it, so the returned value is always a promise:\n\n```js\nlet cache = new Map();\n\nfunction loadCached(url) {\n  if (cache.has(url)) {\n*!*\n    return Promise.resolve(cache.get(url)); // (*)\n*/!*\n  }\n\n  return fetch(url)\n    .then(response => response.text())\n    .then(text => {\n      cache.set(url,text);\n      return text;\n    });\n}\n```\n\nWe can write `loadCached(url).then(…)`, because the function is guaranteed to return a promise. We can always use `.then` after `loadCached`. That's the purpose of `Promise.resolve` in the line `(*)`.\n\n### Promise.reject\n\n`Promise.reject(error)` creates a rejected promise with `error`.\n\nSame as:\n\n```js\nlet promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(error));\n```\n\nIn practice, this method is almost never used.\n\n## Summary\n\nThere are 5 static methods of `Promise` class:\n\n1. `Promise.all(promises)` -- waits for all promises to resolve and returns an array of their results. If any of the given promises rejects, it becomes the error of `Promise.all`, and all other results are ignored.\n2. `Promise.allSettled(promises)` (recently added method) -- waits for all promises to settle and returns their results as an array of objects with:\n    - `status`: `\"fulfilled\"` or `\"rejected\"`\n    - `value` (if fulfilled) or `reason` (if rejected).\n3. `Promise.race(promises)` -- waits for the first promise to settle, and its result/error becomes the outcome.\n4. `Promise.resolve(value)` -- makes a resolved promise with the given value.\n5. `Promise.reject(error)` -- makes a rejected promise with the given error.\n\nOf these five, `Promise.all` is probably the most common in practice.",

        "content": "\n\n\"Promisification\" is a long word for a simple transformation. It's the conversion of a function that accepts a callback into a function that returns a promise.\n\nSuch transformations are often required in real-life, as many functions and libraries are callback-based. But promises are more convenient, so it makes sense to promisify them.\n\nFor instance, we have `loadScript(src, callback)` from the chapter <info:callbacks>.\n\n```js run\nfunction loadScript(src, callback) {\n  let script = document.createElement('script');\n  script.src = src;\n\n  script.onload = () => callback(null, script);\n  script.onerror = () => callback(new Error(`Script load error for ${src}`));\n\n  document.head.append(script);\n}\n\n// usage:\n// loadScript('path/script.js', (err, script) => {...})\n```\n\nLet's promisify it. The new `loadScriptPromise(src)` function achieves the same result, but it accepts only `src` (no `callback`) and returns a promise.\n\n```js\nlet loadScriptPromise = function(src) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    loadScript(src, (err, script) => {\n      if (err) reject(err)\n      else resolve(script);\n    });\n  })\n}\n\n// usage:\n// loadScriptPromise('path/script.js').then(...)\n```\n\nNow `loadScriptPromise` fits well in promise-based code.\n\nAs we can see, it delegates all the work to the original `loadScript`, providing its own callback that translates to promise `resolve/reject`.\n\nIn practice we'll probably need to promisify many functions, so it makes sense to use a helper. We'll call it `promisify(f)`: it accepts a to-promisify function `f` and returns a wrapper function.\n\nThat wrapper does the same as in the code above: returns a promise and passes the call to the original `f`, tracking the result in a custom callback:\n\n```js\nfunction promisify(f) {\n  return function (...args) { // return a wrapper-function\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      function callback(err, result) { // our custom callback for f\n        if (err) {\n          reject(err);\n        } else {\n          resolve(result);\n        }\n      }\n\n      args.push(callback); // append our custom callback to the end of f arguments\n\n      f.call(this, ...args); // call the original function\n    });\n  };\n};\n\n// usage:\nlet loadScriptPromise = promisify(loadScript);\nloadScriptPromise(...).then(...);\n```\n\nHere we assume that the original function expects a callback with two arguments `(err, result)`. That's what we encounter most often. Then our custom callback is in exactly the right format, and `promisify` works great for such a case.\n\nBut what if the original `f` expects a callback with more arguments `callback(err, res1, res2, ...)`?\n\nHere's a more advanced version of `promisify`: if called as `promisify(f, true)`, the promise result will be an array of callback results `[res1, res2, ...]`:\n\n```js\n// promisify(f, true) to get array of results\nfunction promisify(f, manyArgs = false) {\n  return function (...args) {\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      function *!*callback(err, ...results*/!*) { // our custom callback for f\n        if (err) {\n          reject(err);\n        } else {\n          // resolve with all callback results if manyArgs is specified\n          *!*resolve(manyArgs ? results : results[0]);*/!*\n        }\n      }\n\n      args.push(callback);\n\n      f.call(this, ...args);\n    });\n  };\n};\n\n// usage:\nf = promisify(f, true);\nf(...).then(arrayOfResults => ..., err => ...)\n```\n\nFor more exotic callback formats, like those without `err` at all: `callback(result)`, we can promisify such functions manually without using the helper.\n\nThere are also modules with a bit more flexible promisification functions, e.g. [es6-promisify](https://github.com/digitaldesignlabs/es6-promisify). In Node.js, there's a built-in `util.promisify` function for that.\n\n```smart\nPromisification is a great approach, especially when you use `async/await` (see the next chapter), but not a total replacement for callbacks.\n\nRemember, a promise may have only one result, but a callback may technically be called many times.\n\nSo promisification is only meant for functions that call the callback once. Further calls will be ignored.\n```",

        "content": "\n\nPromise handlers `.then`/`.catch`/`.finally` are always asynchronous.\n\nEven when a Promise is immediately resolved, the code on the lines *below* `.then`/`.catch`/`.finally` will still execute before these handlers.\n\nHere's a demo:\n\n```js run\nlet promise = Promise.resolve();\n\npromise.then(() => alert(\"promise done!\"));\n\nalert(\"code finished\"); // this alert shows first\n```\n\nIf you run it, you see `code finished` first, and then `promise done!`.\n\nThat's strange, because the promise is definitely done from the beginning.\n\nWhy did the `.then` trigger afterwards? What's going on?\n\n## Microtasks queue\n\nAsynchronous tasks need proper management. For that, the ECMA standard specifies an internal queue `PromiseJobs`, more often referred to as the \"microtask queue\" (ES8 term).\n\nAs stated in the [specification](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-jobs-and-job-queues):\n\n- The queue is first-in-first-out: tasks enqueued first are run first.\n- Execution of a task is initiated only when nothing else is running.\n\nOr, to say more simply, when a promise is ready, its `.then/catch/finally` handlers are put into the queue; they are not executed yet. When the JavaScript engine becomes free from the current code, it takes a task from the queue and executes it.\n\nThat's why \"code finished\" in the example above shows first.\n\n![](promiseQueue.svg)\n\nPromise handlers always go through this internal queue.\n\nIf there's a chain with multiple `.then/catch/finally`, then every one of them is executed asynchronously. That is, it first gets queued, then executed when the current code is complete and previously queued handlers are finished.\n\n**What if the order matters for us? How can we make `code finished` run after `promise done`?**\n\nEasy, just put it into the queue with `.then`:\n\n```js run\nPromise.resolve()\n  .then(() => alert(\"promise done!\"))\n  .then(() => alert(\"code finished\"));\n```\n\nNow the order is as intended.\n\n## Unhandled rejection\n\nRemember the `unhandledrejection` event from the article <info:promise-error-handling>?\n\nNow we can see exactly how JavaScript finds out that there was an unhandled rejection.\n\n**An \"unhandled rejection\" occurs when a promise error is not handled at the end of the microtask queue.**\n\nNormally, if we expect an error, we add `.catch` to the promise chain to handle it:\n\n```js run\nlet promise = Promise.reject(new Error(\"Promise Failed!\"));\n*!*\npromise.catch(err => alert('caught'));\n*/!*\n\n// doesn't run: error handled\nwindow.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', event => alert(event.reason));\n```\n\nBut if we forget to add `.catch`, then, after the microtask queue is empty, the engine triggers the event:\n\n```js run\nlet promise = Promise.reject(new Error(\"Promise Failed!\"));\n\n// Promise Failed!\nwindow.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', event => alert(event.reason));\n```\n\nWhat if we handle the error later? Like this:\n\n```js run\nlet promise = Promise.reject(new Error(\"Promise Failed!\"));\n*!*\nsetTimeout(() => promise.catch(err => alert('caught')), 1000);\n*/!*\n\n// Error: Promise Failed!\nwindow.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', event => alert(event.reason));\n```\n\nNow, if we run it, we'll see `Promise Failed!` first and then `caught`.\n\nIf we didn't know about the microtasks queue, we could wonder: \"Why did `unhandledrejection` handler run? We did catch and handle the error!\"\n\nBut now we understand that `unhandledrejection` is generated when the microtask queue is complete: the engine examines promises and, if any of them is in the \"rejected\" state, then the event triggers.\n\nIn the example above, `.catch` added by `setTimeout` also triggers. But it does so later, after `unhandledrejection` has already occurred, so it doesn't change anything.\n\n## Summary\n\nPromise handling is always asynchronous, as all promise actions pass through the internal \"promise jobs\" queue, also called \"microtask queue\" (ES8 term).\n\nSo `.then/catch/finally` handlers are always called after the current code is finished.\n\nIf we need to guarantee that a piece of code is executed after `.then/catch/finally`, we can add it into a chained `.then` call.\n\nIn most Javascript engines, including browsers and Node.js, the concept of microtasks is closely tied with the \"event loop\" and \"macrotasks\". As these have no direct relation to promises, they are covered in another part of the tutorial, in the article <info:event-loop>.",

        "content": "\n\nThere's a special syntax to work with promises in a more comfortable fashion, called \"async/await\". It's surprisingly easy to understand and use.\n\n## Async functions\n\nLet's start with the `async` keyword. It can be placed before a function, like this:\n\n```js\nasync function f() {\n  return 1;\n}\n```\n\nThe word \"async\" before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise. Other values are wrapped in a resolved promise automatically.\n\nFor instance, this function returns a resolved promise with the result of `1`; let's test it:\n\n```js run\nasync function f() {\n  return 1;\n}\n\nf().then(alert); // 1\n```\n\n...We could explicitly return a promise, which would be the same:\n\n```js run\nasync function f() {\n  return Promise.resolve(1);\n}\n\nf().then(alert); // 1\n```\n\nSo, `async` ensures that the function returns a promise, and wraps non-promises in it. Simple enough, right? But not only that. There's another keyword, `await`, that works only inside `async` functions, and it's pretty cool.\n\n## Await\n\nThe syntax:\n\n```js\n// works only inside async functions\nlet value = await promise;\n```\n\nThe keyword `await` makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.\n\nHere's an example with a promise that resolves in 1 second:\n```js run\nasync function f() {\n\n  let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    setTimeout(() => resolve(\"done!\"), 1000)\n  });\n\n*!*\n  let result = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves (*)\n*/!*\n\n  alert(result); // \"done!\"\n}\n\nf();\n```\n\nThe function execution \"pauses\" at the line `(*)` and resumes when the promise settles, with `result` becoming its result. So the code above shows \"done!\" in one second.\n\nLet's emphasize: `await` literally makes JavaScript wait until the promise settles, and then go on with the result. That doesn't cost any CPU resources, because the engine can do other jobs in the meantime: execute other scripts, handle events, etc.\n\nIt's just a more elegant syntax of getting the promise result than `promise.then`, easier to read and write.\n\n````warn header=\"Can't use `await` in regular functions\"\nIf we try to use `await` in non-async function, there would be a syntax error:\n\n```js run\nfunction f() {\n  let promise = Promise.resolve(1);\n*!*\n  let result = await promise; // Syntax error\n*/!*\n}\n```\n\nWe will get this error if we do not put `async` before a function. As said, `await` only works inside an `async function`.\n````\n\nLet's take the `showAvatar()` example from the chapter <info:promise-chaining> and rewrite it using `async/await`:\n\n1. We'll need to replace `.then` calls with `await`.\n2. Also we should make the function `async` for them to work.\n\n```js run\nasync function showAvatar() {\n\n  // read our JSON\n  let response = await fetch('/article/promise-chaining/user.json');\n  let user = await response.json();\n\n  // read github user\n  let githubResponse = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${user.name}`);\n  let githubUser = await githubResponse.json();\n\n  // show the avatar\n  let img = document.createElement('img');\n  img.src = githubUser.avatar_url;\n  img.className = \"promise-avatar-example\";\n  document.body.append(img);\n\n  // wait 3 seconds\n  await new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));\n\n  img.remove();\n\n  return githubUser;\n}\n\nshowAvatar();\n```\n\nPretty clean and easy to read, right? Much better than before.\n\n````smart header=\"`await` won't work in the top-level code\"\nPeople who are just starting to use `await` tend to forget the fact that we can't use `await` in top-level code. For example, this will not work:\n\n```js run\n// syntax error in top-level code\nlet response = await fetch('/article/promise-chaining/user.json');\nlet user = await response.json();\n```\n\nBut we can wrap it into an anonymous async function, like this:\n\n```js\n(async () => {\n  let response = await fetch('/article/promise-chaining/user.json');\n  let user = await response.json();\n  ...\n})();\n```\n\n\n````\n````smart header=\"`await` accepts \\\"thenables\\\"\"\nLike `promise.then`, `await` allows us to use thenable objects (those with a callable `then` method). The idea is that a third-party object may not be a promise, but promise-compatible: if it supports `.then`, that's enough to use it with `await`.\n\nHere's a demo `Thenable` class; the `await` below accepts its instances:\n\n```js run\nclass Thenable {\n  constructor(num) {\n    this.num = num;\n  }\n  then(resolve, reject) {\n    alert(resolve);\n    // resolve with this.num*2 after 1000ms\n    setTimeout(() => resolve(this.num * 2), 1000); // (*)\n  }\n};\n\nasync function f() {\n  // waits for 1 second, then result becomes 2\n  let result = await new Thenable(1);\n  alert(result);\n}\n\nf();\n```\n\nIf `await` gets a non-promise object with `.then`, it calls that method providing the built-in functions `resolve` and `reject` as arguments (just as it does for a regular `Promise` executor). Then `await` waits until one of them is called (in the example above it happens in the line `(*)`) and then proceeds with the result.\n````\n\n````smart header=\"Async class methods\"\nTo declare an async class method, just prepend it with `async`:\n\n```js run\nclass Waiter {\n*!*\n  async wait() {\n*/!*\n    return await Promise.resolve(1);\n  }\n}\n\nnew Waiter()\n  .wait()\n  .then(alert); // 1\n```\nThe meaning is the same: it ensures that the returned value is a promise and enables `await`.\n\n````\n## Error handling\n\nIf a promise resolves normally, then `await promise` returns the result. But in the case of a rejection, it throws the error, just as if there were a `throw` statement at that line.\n\nThis code:\n\n```js\nasync function f() {\n*!*\n  await Promise.reject(new Error(\"Whoops!\"));\n*/!*\n}\n```\n\n...is the same as this:\n\n```js\nasync function f() {\n*!*\n  throw new Error(\"Whoops!\");\n*/!*\n}\n```\n\nIn real situations, the promise may take some time before it rejects. In that case there will be a delay before `await` throws an error.\n\nWe can catch that error using `try..catch`, the same way as a regular `throw`:\n\n```js run\nasync function f() {\n\n  try {\n    let response = await fetch('http://no-such-url');\n  } catch(err) {\n*!*\n    alert(err); // TypeError: failed to fetch\n*/!*\n  }\n}\n\nf();\n```\n\nIn the case of an error, the control jumps to the `catch` block. We can also wrap multiple lines:\n\n```js run\nasync function f() {\n\n  try {\n    let response = await fetch('/no-user-here');\n    let user = await response.json();\n  } catch(err) {\n    // catches errors both in fetch and response.json\n    alert(err);\n  }\n}\n\nf();\n```\n\nIf we don't have `try..catch`, then the promise generated by the call of the async function `f()` becomes rejected. We can append `.catch` to handle it:\n\n```js run\nasync function f() {\n  let response = await fetch('http://no-such-url');\n}\n\n// f() becomes a rejected promise\n*!*\nf().catch(alert); // TypeError: failed to fetch // (*)\n*/!*\n```\n\nIf we forget to add `.catch` there, then we get an unhandled promise error (viewable in the console). We can catch such errors using a global `unhandledrejection` event handler as described in the chapter <info:promise-error-handling>.\n\n\n```smart header=\"`async/await` and `promise.then/catch`\"\nWhen we use `async/await`, we rarely need `.then`, because `await` handles the waiting for us. And we can use a regular `try..catch` instead of `.catch`. That's usually (but not always) more convenient.\n\nBut at the top level of the code, when we're outside any `async` function, we're syntactically unable to use `await`, so it's a normal practice to add `.then/catch` to handle the final result or falling-through error, like in the line `(*)` of the example above.\n```\n\n````smart header=\"`async/await` works well with `Promise.all`\"\nWhen we need to wait for multiple promises, we can wrap them in `Promise.all` and then `await`:\n\n```js\n// wait for the array of results\nlet results = await Promise.all([\n  fetch(url1),\n  fetch(url2),\n  ...\n]);\n```\n\nIn the case of an error, it propagates as usual, from the failed promise to `Promise.all`, and then becomes an exception that we can catch using `try..catch` around the call.\n\n````\n\n## Summary\n\nThe `async` keyword before a function has two effects:\n\n1. Makes it always return a promise.\n2. Allows `await` to be used in it.\n\nThe `await` keyword before a promise makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles, and then:\n\n1. If it's an error, the exception is generated — same as if `throw error` were called at that very place.\n2. Otherwise, it returns the result.\n\nTogether they provide a great framework to write asynchronous code that is easy to both read and write.\n\nWith `async/await` we rarely need to write `promise.then/catch`, but we still shouldn't forget that they are based on promises, because sometimes (e.g. in the outermost scope) we have to use these methods. Also `Promise.all` is nice when we are waiting for many tasks simultaneously.",

        "content": "\n\nRegular functions return only one, single value (or nothing).\n\nGenerators can return (\"yield\") multiple values, one after another, on-demand. They work great with [iterables](info:iterable), allowing to create data streams with ease.\n\n## Generator functions\n\nTo create a generator, we need a special syntax construct: `function*`, so-called \"generator function\".\n\nIt looks like this:\n\n```js\nfunction* generateSequence() {\n  yield 1;\n  yield 2;\n  return 3;\n}\n```\n\nGenerator functions behave differently from regular ones. When such function is called, it doesn't run its code. Instead it returns a special object, called \"generator object\", to manage the execution.\n\nHere, take a look:\n\n```js run\nfunction* generateSequence() {\n  yield 1;\n  yield 2;\n  return 3;\n}\n\n// \"generator function\" creates \"generator object\"\nlet generator = generateSequence();\n*!*\nalert(generator); // [object Generator]\n*/!*\n```\n\nThe function code execution hasn't started yet:\n\n![](generateSequence-1.svg)\n\nThe main method of a generator is `next()`. When called, it runs the execution until the nearest `yield <value>` statement (`value` can be omitted, then it's `undefined`). Then the function execution pauses, and the yielded `value` is returned to the outer code.\n\nThe result of `next()` is always an object with two properties:\n- `value`: the yielded value.\n- `done`: `true` if the function code has finished, otherwise `false`.\n\nFor instance, here we create the generator and get its first yielded value:\n\n```js run\nfunction* generateSequence() {\n  yield 1;\n  yield 2;\n  return 3;\n}\n\nlet generator = generateSequence();\n\n*!*\nlet one = generator.next();\n*/!*\n\nalert(JSON.stringify(one)); // {value: 1, done: false}\n```\n\nAs of now, we got the first value only, and the function execution is on the second line:\n\n![](generateSequence-2.svg)\n\nLet's call `generator.next()` again. It resumes the code execution and returns the next `yield`:\n\n```js\nlet two = generator.next();\n\nalert(JSON.stringify(two)); // {value: 2, done: false}\n```\n\n![](generateSequence-3.svg)\n\nAnd, if we call it a third time, the execution reaches the `return` statement that finishes the function:\n\n```js\nlet three = generator.next();\n\nalert(JSON.stringify(three)); // {value: 3, *!*done: true*/!*}\n```\n\n![](generateSequence-4.svg)\n\nNow the generator is done. We should see it from `done:true` and process `value:3` as the final result.\n\nNew calls to `generator.next()` don't make sense any more. If we do them, they return the same object: `{done: true}`.\n\n```smart header=\"`function* f(…)` or `function *f(…)`?\"\nBoth syntaxes are correct.\n\nBut usually the first syntax is preferred, as the star `*` denotes that it's a generator function, it describes the kind, not the name, so it should stick with the `function` keyword.\n```\n\n## Generators are iterable\n\nAs you probably already guessed looking at the `next()` method, generators are [iterable](info:iterable).\n\nWe can loop over their values using `for..of`:\n\n```js run\nfunction* generateSequence() {\n  yield 1;\n  yield 2;\n  return 3;\n}\n\nlet generator = generateSequence();\n\nfor(let value of generator) {\n  alert(value); // 1, then 2\n}\n```\n\nLooks a lot nicer than calling `.next().value`, right?\n\n...But please note: the example above shows `1`, then `2`, and that's all. It doesn't show `3`!\n\nIt's because `for..of` iteration ignores the last `value`, when `done: true`. So, if we want all results to be shown by `for..of`, we must return them with `yield`:\n\n```js run\nfunction* generateSequence() {\n  yield 1;\n  yield 2;\n*!*\n  yield 3;\n*/!*\n}\n\nlet generator = generateSequence();\n\nfor(let value of generator) {\n  alert(value); // 1, then 2, then 3\n}\n```\n\nAs generators are iterable, we can call all related functionality, e.g. the spread syntax `...`:\n\n```js run\nfunction* generateSequence() {\n  yield 1;\n  yield 2;\n  yield 3;\n}\n\nlet sequence = [0, ...generateSequence()];\n\nalert(sequence); // 0, 1, 2, 3\n```\n\nIn the code above, `...generateSequence()` turns the iterable generator object into an array of items (read more about the spread syntax in the chapter [](info:rest-parameters-spread#spread-syntax))\n\n## Using generators for iterables\n\nSome time ago, in the chapter [](info:iterable) we created an iterable `range` object that returns values `from..to`.\n\nHere, let's remember the code:\n\n```js run\nlet range = {\n  from: 1,\n  to: 5,\n\n  // for..of range calls this method once in the very beginning\n  [Symbol.iterator]() {\n    // ...it returns the iterator object:\n    // onward, for..of works only with that object, asking it for next values\n    return {\n      current: this.from,\n      last: this.to,\n\n      // next() is called on each iteration by the for..of loop\n      next() {\n        // it should return the value as an object {done:.., value :...}\n        if (this.current <= this.last) {\n          return { done: false, value: this.current++ };\n        } else {\n          return { done: true };\n        }\n      }\n    };\n  }\n};\n\n// iteration over range returns numbers from range.from to range.to\nalert([...range]); // 1,2,3,4,5\n```\n\nWe can use a generator function for iteration by providing it as `Symbol.iterator`.\n\nHere's the same `range`, but much more compact:\n\n```js run\nlet range = {\n  from: 1,\n  to: 5,\n\n  *[Symbol.iterator]() { // a shorthand for [Symbol.iterator]: function*()\n    for(let value = this.from; value <= this.to; value++) {\n      yield value;\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nalert( [...range] ); // 1,2,3,4,5\n```\n\nThat works, because `range[Symbol.iterator]()` now returns a generator, and generator methods are exactly what `for..of` expects:\n- it has a `.next()` method\n- that returns values in the form `{value: ..., done: true/false}`\n\nThat's not a coincidence, of course. Generators were added to JavaScript language with iterators in mind, to implement them easily.\n\nThe variant with a generator is much more concise than the original iterable code of `range`, and keeps the same functionality.\n\n```smart header=\"Generators may generate values forever\"\nIn the examples above we generated finite sequences, but we can also make a generator that yields values forever. For instance, an unending sequence of pseudo-random numbers.\n\nThat surely would require a `break` (or `return`) in `for..of` over such generator. Otherwise, the loop would repeat forever and hang.\n```\n\n## Generator composition\n\nGenerator composition is a special feature of generators that allows to transparently \"embed\" generators in each other.\n\nFor instance, we have a function that generates a sequence of numbers:\n\n```js\nfunction* generateSequence(start, end) {\n  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) yield i;\n}\n```\n\nNow we'd like to reuse it to generate a more complex sequence:\n- first, digits `0..9` (with character codes 48..57),\n- followed by uppercase alphabet letters `A..Z` (character codes 65..90)\n- followed by lowercase alphabet letters `a..z` (character codes 97..122)\n\nWe can use this sequence e.g. to create passwords by selecting characters from it (could add syntax characters as well), but let's generate it first.\n\nIn a regular function, to combine results from multiple other functions, we call them, store the results, and then join at the end.\n\nFor generators, there's a special `yield*` syntax to \"embed\" (compose) one generator into another.\n\nThe composed generator:\n\n```js run\nfunction* generateSequence(start, end) {\n  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) yield i;\n}\n\nfunction* generatePasswordCodes() {\n\n*!*\n  // 0..9\n  yield* generateSequence(48, 57);\n\n  // A..Z\n  yield* generateSequence(65, 90);\n\n  // a..z\n  yield* generateSequence(97, 122);\n*/!*\n\n}\n\nlet str = '';\n\nfor(let code of generatePasswordCodes()) {\n  str += String.fromCharCode(code);\n}\n\nalert(str); // 0..9A..Za..z\n```\n\nThe `yield*` directive *delegates* the execution to another generator. This term means that `yield* gen` iterates over the generator `gen` and transparently forwards its yields outside. As if the values were yielded by the outer generator.\n\nThe result is the same as if we inlined the code from nested generators:\n\n```js run\nfunction* generateSequence(start, end) {\n  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) yield i;\n}\n\nfunction* generateAlphaNum() {\n\n*!*\n  // yield* generateSequence(48, 57);\n  for (let i = 48; i <= 57; i++) yield i;\n\n  // yield* generateSequence(65, 90);\n  for (let i = 65; i <= 90; i++) yield i;\n\n  // yield* generateSequence(97, 122);\n  for (let i = 97; i <= 122; i++) yield i;\n*/!*\n\n}\n\nlet str = '';\n\nfor(let code of generateAlphaNum()) {\n  str += String.fromCharCode(code);\n}\n\nalert(str); // 0..9A..Za..z\n```\n\nA generator composition is a natural way to insert a flow of one generator into another. It doesn't use extra memory to store intermediate results.\n\n## \"yield\" is a two-way street\n\nUntil this moment, generators were similar to iterable objects, with a special syntax to generate values. But in fact they are much more powerful and flexible.\n\nThat's because `yield` is a two-way street: it not only returns the result to the outside, but also can pass the value inside the generator.\n\nTo do so, we should call `generator.next(arg)`, with an argument. That argument becomes the result of `yield`.\n\nLet's see an example:\n\n```js run\nfunction* gen() {\n*!*\n  // Pass a question to the outer code and wait for an answer\n  let result = yield \"2 + 2 = ?\"; // (*)\n*/!*\n\n  alert(result);\n}\n\nlet generator = gen();\n\nlet question = generator.next().value; // <-- yield returns the value\n\ngenerator.next(4); // --> pass the result into the generator  \n```\n\n![](genYield2.svg)\n\n1. The first call `generator.next()` should be always made without an argument (the argument is ignored if passed). It starts the execution and returns the result of the first `yield \"2+2=?\"`. At this point the generator pauses the execution, while staying on the line `(*)`.\n2. Then, as shown at the picture above, the result of `yield` gets into the `question` variable in the calling code.\n3. On `generator.next(4)`, the generator resumes, and `4` gets in as the result: `let result = 4`.\n\nPlease note, the outer code does not have to immediately call `next(4)`. It may take time. That's not a problem: the generator will wait.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js\n// resume the generator after some time\nsetTimeout(() => generator.next(4), 1000);\n```\n\nAs we can see, unlike regular functions, a generator and the calling code can exchange results by passing values in `next/yield`.\n\nTo make things more obvious, here's another example, with more calls:\n\n```js run\nfunction* gen() {\n  let ask1 = yield \"2 + 2 = ?\";\n\n  alert(ask1); // 4\n\n  let ask2 = yield \"3 * 3 = ?\"\n\n  alert(ask2); // 9\n}\n\nlet generator = gen();\n\nalert( generator.next().value ); // \"2 + 2 = ?\"\n\nalert( generator.next(4).value ); // \"3 * 3 = ?\"\n\nalert( generator.next(9).done ); // true\n```\n\nThe execution picture:\n\n![](genYield2-2.svg)\n\n1. The first `.next()` starts the execution... It reaches the first `yield`.\n2. The result is returned to the outer code.\n3. The second `.next(4)` passes `4` back to the generator as the result of the first `yield`, and resumes the execution.\n4. ...It reaches the second `yield`, that becomes the result of the generator call.\n5. The third `next(9)` passes `9` into the generator as the result of the second `yield` and resumes the execution that reaches the end of the function, so `done: true`.\n\nIt's like a \"ping-pong\" game. Each `next(value)` (excluding the first one) passes a value into the generator, that becomes the result of the current `yield`, and then gets back the result of the next `yield`.\n\n## generator.throw\n\nAs we observed in the examples above, the outer code may pass a value into the generator, as the result of `yield`.\n\n...But it can also initiate (throw) an error there. That's natural, as an error is a kind of result.\n\nTo pass an error into a `yield`, we should call `generator.throw(err)`. In that case, the `err` is thrown in the line with that `yield`.\n\nFor instance, here the yield of `\"2 + 2 = ?\"` leads to an error:\n\n```js run\nfunction* gen() {\n  try {\n    let result = yield \"2 + 2 = ?\"; // (1)\n\n    alert(\"The execution does not reach here, because the exception is thrown above\");\n  } catch(e) {\n    alert(e); // shows the error\n  }\n}\n\nlet generator = gen();\n\nlet question = generator.next().value;\n\n*!*\ngenerator.throw(new Error(\"The answer is not found in my database\")); // (2)\n*/!*\n```\n\nThe error, thrown into the generator at line `(2)` leads to an exception in line `(1)` with `yield`. In the example above, `try..catch` catches it and shows it.\n\nIf we don't catch it, then just like any exception, it \"falls out\" the generator into the calling code.\n\nThe current line of the calling code is the line with `generator.throw`, labelled as `(2)`. So we can catch it here, like this:\n\n```js run\nfunction* generate() {\n  let result = yield \"2 + 2 = ?\"; // Error in this line\n}\n\nlet generator = generate();\n\nlet question = generator.next().value;\n\n*!*\ntry {\n  generator.throw(new Error(\"The answer is not found in my database\"));\n} catch(e) {\n  alert(e); // shows the error\n}\n*/!*\n```\n\nIf we don't catch the error there, then, as usual, it falls through to the outer calling code (if any) and, if uncaught, kills the script.\n\n## Summary\n\n- Generators are created by generator functions `function* f(…) {…}`.\n- Inside generators (only) there exists a `yield` operator.\n- The outer code and the generator may exchange results via `next/yield` calls.\n\nIn modern JavaScript, generators are rarely used. But sometimes they come in handy, because the ability of a function to exchange data with the calling code during the execution is quite unique. And, surely, they are great for making iterable objects.\n\nAlso, in the next chapter we'll learn async generators, which are used to read streams of asynchronously generated data (e.g paginated fetches over a network) in `for await ... of` loops.\n\nIn web-programming we often work with streamed data, so that's another very important use case.",

We may need random data: text, numbers, etc. to test things out well.\n\nIn JavaScript, we could use `Math.random()`. But if something goes wrong, we'd like to be able to repeat the test, using exactly the same data.\n\nFor that, so called \"seeded pseudo-random generators\" are used. They take a \"seed\", the first value, and then generate the next ones using a formula so that the same seed yields the same sequence, and hence the whole flow is easily reproducible. We only need to remember the seed to repeat it.\n\nAn example of such formula, that generates somewhat uniformly distributed values:\n\n```\nnext = previous * 16807 % 2147483647\n```\n\nIf we use `1` as the seed, the values will be:\n1. `16807`\n2. `282475249`\n3. `1622650073`\n4. ...and so on...\n\nThe task is to create a generator function `pseudoRandom(seed)` that takes `seed` and creates the generator with this formula.\n\nUsage example:\n\n```js\nlet generator = pseudoRandom(1);\n\nalert(generator.next().value); // 16807\nalert(generator.next().value); // 282475249\nalert(generator.next().value); // 1622650073\n```",

And asynchronous generators make it even more convenient.\n\nLet's see a simple example first, to grasp the syntax, and then review a real-life use case.\n\n## Async iterators\n\nAsynchronous iterators are similar to regular iterators, with a few syntactic differences.\n\nA \"regular\" iterable object, as described in the chapter <info:iterable>, looks like this:\n\n```js run\nlet range = {\n  from: 1,\n  to: 5,\n\n  // for..of calls this method once in the very beginning\n*!*\n  [Symbol.iterator]() {\n*/!*\n    // ...it returns the iterator object:\n    // onward, for..of works only with that object,\n    // asking it for next values using next()\n    return {\n      current: this.from,\n      last: this.to,\n\n      // next() is called on each iteration by the for..of loop\n*!*\n      next() { // (2)\n        // it should return the value as an object {done:.., value :...}\n*/!*\n        if (this.current <= this.last) {\n          return { done: false, value: this.current++ };\n        } else {\n          return { done: true };\n        }\n      }\n    };\n  }\n};\n\nfor(let value of range) {\n  alert(value); // 1 then 2, then 3, then 4, then 5\n}\n```\n\nIf necessary, please refer to the [chapter about iterables](info:iterable) for details about regular iterators.\n\nTo make the object iterable asynchronously:\n1. We need to use `Symbol.asyncIterator` instead of `Symbol.iterator`.\n2. `next()` should return a promise.\n3. To iterate over such an object, we should use a `for await (let item of iterable)` loop.\n\nLet's make an iterable `range` object, like the one before, but now it will return values asynchronously, one per second:\n\n```js run\nlet range = {\n  from: 1,\n  to: 5,\n\n  // for await..of calls this method once in the very beginning\n*!*\n  [Symbol.asyncIterator]() { // (1)\n*/!*\n    // ...it returns the iterator object:\n    // onward, for await..of works only with that object,\n    // asking it for next values using next()\n    return {\n      current: this.from,\n      last: this.to,\n\n      // next() is called on each iteration by the for await..of loop\n*!*\n      async next() { // (2)\n        // it should return the value as an object {done:.., value :...}\n        // (automatically wrapped into a promise by async)\n*/!*\n\n*!*\n        // can use await inside, do async stuff:\n        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // (3)\n*/!*\n\n        if (this.current <= this.last) {\n          return { done: false, value: this.current++ };\n        } else {\n          return { done: true };\n        }\n      }\n    };\n  }\n};\n\n(async () => {\n\n*!*\n  for await (let value of range) { // (4)\n    alert(value); // 1,2,3,4,5\n  }\n*/!*\n\n})()\n```\n\nAs we can see, the structure is similar to regular iterators:\n\n1. To make an object asynchronously iterable, it must have a method `Symbol.asyncIterator` `(1)`.\n2. This method must return the object with `next()` method returning a promise `(2)`.\n3. The `next()` method doesn't have to be `async`, it may be a regular method returning a promise, but `async` allows us to use `await`, so that's convenient. Here we just delay for a second `(3)`.\n4. To iterate, we use `for await(let value of range)` `(4)`, namely add \"await\" after \"for\". It calls `range[Symbol.asyncIterator]()` once, and then its `next()` for values.\n\nHere's a small cheatsheet:\n\n|       | Iterators | Async iterators |\n|-------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Object method to provide iterator | `Symbol.iterator` | `Symbol.asyncIterator` |\n| `next()` return value is              | any value         | `Promise`  |\n| to loop, use                          | `for..of`         | `for await..of` |\n\n````warn header=\"The spread syntax `...` doesn't work asynchronously\"\nFeatures that require regular, synchronous iterators, don't work with asynchronous ones.\n\nFor instance, a spread syntax won't work:\n```js\nalert( [...range] ); // Error, no Symbol.iterator\n```\n\nThat's natural, as it expects to find `Symbol.iterator`, same as `for..of` without `await`. Not `Symbol.asyncIterator`.\n````\n\n## Async generators\n\nAs we already know, JavaScript also supports generators, and they are iterable.\n\nLet's recall a sequence generator from the chapter [](info:generators). It generates a sequence of values from `start` to `end`:\n\n```js run\nfunction* generateSequence(start, end) {\n  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {\n    yield i;\n  }\n}\n\nfor(let value of generateSequence(1, 5)) {\n  alert(value); // 1, then 2, then 3, then 4, then 5\n}\n```\n\nIn regular generators we can't use `await`. All values must come synchronously: there's no place for delay in `for..of`, it's a synchronous construct.\n\nBut what if we need to use `await` in the generator body? To perform network requests, for instance.\n\nNo problem, just prepend it with `async`, like this:\n\n```js run\n*!*async*/!* function* generateSequence(start, end) {\n\n  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {\n\n*!*\n    // yay, can use await!\n    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));\n*/!*\n\n    yield i;\n  }\n\n}\n\n(async () => {\n\n  let generator = generateSequence(1, 5);\n  for *!*await*/!* (let value of generator) {\n    alert(value); // 1, then 2, then 3, then 4, then 5\n  }\n\n})();\n```\n\nNow we have the async generator, iterable with `for await...of`.\n\nIt's indeed very simple. We add the `async` keyword, and the generator now can use `await` inside of it, rely on promises and other async functions.\n\nTechnically, another difference of an async generator is that its `generator.next()` method is now asynchronous also, it returns promises.\n\nIn a regular generator we'd use `result = generator.next()` to get values. In an async generator, we should add `await`, like this:\n\n```js\nresult = await generator.next(); // result = {value: ..., done: true/false}\n```\n\n## Async iterables\n\nAs we already know, to make an object iterable, we should add `Symbol.iterator` to it.\n\n```js\nlet range = {\n  from: 1,\n  to: 5,\n*!*\n  [Symbol.iterator]() {\n    return <object with next to make range iterable>\n  }\n*/!*\n}\n```\n\nA common practice for `Symbol.iterator` is to return a generator, rather than a plain object with `next` as in the example before.\n\nLet's recall an example from the chapter [](info:generators):\n\n```js run\nlet range = {\n  from: 1,\n  to: 5,\n\n  *[Symbol.iterator]() { // a shorthand for [Symbol.iterator]: function*()\n    for(let value = this.from; value <= this.to; value++) {\n      yield value;\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nfor(let value of range) {\n  alert(value); // 1, then 2, then 3, then 4, then 5\n}\n```\n\nHere a custom object `range` is iterable, and the generator `*[Symbol.iterator]` implements the logic for listing values.\n\nIf we'd like to add async actions into the generator, then we should replace `Symbol.iterator` with async `Symbol.asyncIterator`:\n\n```js run\nlet range = {\n  from: 1,\n  to: 5,\n\n*!*\n  async *[Symbol.asyncIterator]() { // same as [Symbol.asyncIterator]: async function*()\n*/!*\n    for(let value = this.from; value <= this.to; value++) {\n\n      // make a pause between values, wait for something  \n      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));\n\n      yield value;\n    }\n  }\n};\n\n(async () => {\n\n  for *!*await*/!* (let value of range) {\n    alert(value); // 1, then 2, then 3, then 4, then 5\n  }\n\n})();\n```\n\nNow values come with a delay of 1 second between them.\n\n## Real-life example\n\nSo far we've seen simple examples, to gain basic understanding. Now let's review a real-life use case.\n\nThere are many online services that deliver paginated data. For instance, when we need a list of users, a request returns a pre-defined count (e.g. 100 users) - \"one page\", and provides a URL to the next page.\n\nThis pattern is very common. It's not about users, but just about anything. For instance, GitHub allows us to retrieve commits in the same, paginated fashion:\n\n- We should make a request to URL in the form `https://api.github.com/repos/<repo>/commits`.\n- It responds with a JSON of 30 commits, and also provides a link to the next page in the `Link` header.\n- Then we can use that link for the next request, to get more commits, and so on.\n\nBut we'd like to have a simpler API: an iterable object with commits, so that we could go over them like this:\n\n```js\nlet repo = 'javascript-tutorial/en.javascript.info'; // GitHub repository to get commits from\n\nfor await (let commit of fetchCommits(repo)) {\n  // process commit\n}\n```\n\nWe'd like to make a function `fetchCommits(repo)` that gets commits for us, making requests whenever needed. And let it care about all pagination stuff. For us it'll be a simple `for await..of`.\n\nWith async generators that's pretty easy to implement:\n\n```js\nasync function* fetchCommits(repo) {\n  let url = `https://api.github.com/repos/${repo}/commits`;\n\n  while (url) {\n    const response = await fetch(url, { // (1)\n      headers: {'User-Agent': 'Our script'}, // github requires user-agent header\n    });\n\n    const body = await response.json(); // (2) response is JSON (array of commits)\n\n    // (3) the URL of the next page is in the headers, extract it\n    let nextPage = response.headers.get('Link').match(/<(.*?)>; rel=\"next\"/);\n    nextPage = nextPage?.[1];\n\n    url = nextPage;\n\n    for(let commit of body) { // (4) yield commits one by one, until the page ends\n      yield commit;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n1. We use the browser [fetch](info:fetch) method to download from a remote URL. It allows us to supply authorization and other headers if needed -- here GitHub requires `User-Agent`.\n2. The fetch result is parsed as JSON. That's again a `fetch`-specific method.\n3. We should get the next page URL from the `Link` header of the response. It has a special format, so we use a regexp for that. The next page URL may look like `https://api.github.com/repositories/93253246/commits?page=2`. It's generated by GitHub itself.\n4. Then we yield all commits received, and when they finish, the next `while(url)` iteration will trigger, making one more request.\n\nAn example of use (shows commit authors in console):\n\n```js run\n(async () => {\n\n  let count = 0;\n\n  for await (const commit of fetchCommits('javascript-tutorial/en.javascript.info')) {\n\n    console.log(commit.author.login);\n\n    if (++count == 100) { // let's stop at 100 commits\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n\n})();\n```\n\nThat's just what we wanted. The internal mechanics of paginated requests is invisible from the outside. For us it's just an async generator that returns commits.\n\n## Summary\n\nRegular iterators and generators work fine with the data that doesn't take time to generate.\n\nWhen we expect the data to come asynchronously, with delays, their async counterparts can be used, and `for await..of` instead of `for..of`.\n\nSyntax differences between async and regular iterators:\n\n|       | Iterable | Async Iterable |\n|-------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Method to provide iterator | `Symbol.iterator` | `Symbol.asyncIterator` |\n| `next()` return value is          | `{value:…, done: true/false}`         | `Promise` that resolves to `{value:…, done: true/false}`  |\n\nSyntax differences between async and regular generators:\n\n|       | Generators | Async generators |\n|-------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Declaration | `function*` | `async function*` |\n| `next()` return value is          | `{value:…, done: true/false}`         | `Promise` that resolves to `{value:…, done: true/false}`  |\n\nIn web-development we often meet streams of data, when it flows chunk-by-chunk. For instance, downloading or uploading a big file.\n\nWe can use async generators to process such data. It's also noteworthy that in some environments, like in browsers, there's also another API called Streams, that provides special interfaces to work with such streams, to transform the data and to pass it from one stream to another (e.g. download from one place and immediately send elsewhere).",

        "content": "\n\nAs our application grows bigger, we want to split it into multiple files, so called \"modules\". A module usually contains a class or a library of functions.\n\nFor a long time, JavaScript existed without a language-level module syntax. That wasn't a problem, because initially scripts were small and simple, so there was no need.\n\nBut eventually scripts became more and more complex, so the community invented a variety of ways to organize code into modules, special libraries to load modules on demand.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- [AMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition) -- one of the most ancient module systems, initially implemented by the library [require.js](http://requirejs.org/).\n- [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1) -- the module system created for Node.js server.\n- [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) -- one more module system, suggested as a universal one, compatible with AMD and CommonJS.\n\nNow all these slowly become a part of history, but we still can find them in old scripts.\n\nThe language-level module system appeared in the standard in 2015, gradually evolved since then, and is now supported by all major browsers and in Node.js. So we'll study it from now on.\n\n## What is a module?\n\nA module is just a file. One script is one module.\n\nModules can load each other and use special directives `export` and `import` to interchange functionality, call functions of one module from another one:\n\n- `export` keyword labels variables and functions that should be accessible from outside the current module.\n- `import` allows the import of functionality from other modules.\n\nFor instance, if we have a file `sayHi.js` exporting a function:\n\n```js\n// 📁 sayHi.js\nexport function sayHi(user) {\n  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);\n}\n```\n\n...Then another file may import and use it:\n\n```js\n// 📁 main.js\nimport {sayHi} from './sayHi.js';\n\nalert(sayHi); // function...\nsayHi('John'); // Hello, John!\n```\n\nThe `import` directive loads the module by path `./sayHi.js` relative to the current file, and assigns exported function `sayHi` to the corresponding variable.\n\nLet's run the example in-browser.\n\nAs modules support special keywords and features, we must tell the browser that a script should be treated as a module, by using the attribute `<script type=\"module\">`.\n\nLike this:\n\n[codetabs src=\"say\" height=\"140\" current=\"index.html\"]\n\nThe browser automatically fetches and evaluates the imported module (and its imports if needed), and then runs the script.\n\n```warn header=\"Modules work only via HTTP, not in local files\"\nIf you try to open a web-page locally, via `file://` protocol, you'll find that `import/export` directives don't work. Use a local web-server, such as [static-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/static-server#getting-started) or use the \"live server\" capability of your editor, such as VS Code [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to test them.\n```\n\n## Core module features\n\nWhat's different in modules, compared to \"regular\" scripts?\n\nThere are core features, valid both for browser and server-side JavaScript.\n\n### Always \"use strict\"\n\nModules always `use strict`, by default. E.g. assigning to an undeclared variable will give an error.\n\n```html run\n<script type=\"module\">\n  a = 5; // error\n</script>\n```\n\n### Module-level scope\n\nEach module has its own top-level scope. In other words, top-level variables and functions from a module are not seen in other scripts.\n\nIn the example below, two scripts are imported, and `hello.js` tries to use `user` variable declared in `user.js`, and fails:\n\n[codetabs src=\"scopes\" height=\"140\" current=\"index.html\"]\n\nModules are expected to `export` what they want to be accessible from outside and `import` what they need.\n\nSo we should import `user.js` into `hello.js` and get the required functionality from it instead of relying on global variables.\n\nThis is the correct variant:\n\n[codetabs src=\"scopes-working\" height=\"140\" current=\"hello.js\"]\n\nIn the browser, independent top-level scope also exists for each `<script type=\"module\">`:\n\n```html run\n<script type=\"module\">\n  // The variable is only visible in this module script\n  let user = \"John\";\n</script>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\n  *!*\n  alert(user); // Error: user is not defined\n  */!*\n</script>\n```\n\nIf we really need to make a window-level global variable, we can explicitly assign it to `window` and access as `window.user`. But that's an exception requiring a good reason.\n\n### A module code is evaluated only the first time when imported\n\nIf the same module is imported into multiple other places, its code is executed only the first time, then exports are given to all importers.\n\nThat has important consequences. Let's look at them using examples:\n\nFirst, if executing a module code brings side-effects, like showing a message, then importing it multiple times will trigger it only once -- the first time:\n\n```js\n// 📁 alert.js\nalert(\"Module is evaluated!\");\n```\n\n```js\n// Import the same module from different files\n\n// 📁 1.js\nimport `./alert.js`; // Module is evaluated!\n\n// 📁 2.js\nimport `./alert.js`; // (shows nothing)\n```\n\nIn practice, top-level module code is mostly used for initialization, creation of internal data structures, and if we want something to be reusable -- export it.\n\nNow, a more advanced example.\n\nLet's say, a module exports an object:\n\n```js\n// 📁 admin.js\nexport let admin = {\n  name: \"John\"\n};\n```\n\nIf this module is imported from multiple files, the module is only evaluated the first time, `admin` object is created, and then passed to all further importers.\n\nAll importers get exactly the one and only `admin` object:\n\n```js\n// 📁 1.js\nimport {admin} from './admin.js';\nadmin.name = \"Pete\";\n\n// 📁 2.js\nimport {admin} from './admin.js';\nalert(admin.name); // Pete\n\n*!*\n// Both 1.js and 2.js imported the same object\n// Changes made in 1.js are visible in 2.js\n*/!*\n```\n\nSo, let's reiterate -- the module is executed only once. Exports are generated, and then they are shared between importers, so if something changes the `admin` object, other modules will see that.\n\nSuch behavior allows us to *configure* modules on first import. We can setup its properties once, and then in further imports it's ready.\n\nFor instance, the `admin.js` module may provide certain functionality, but expect the credentials to come into the `admin` object from outside:\n\n```js\n// 📁 admin.js\nexport let admin = { };\n\nexport function sayHi() {\n  alert(`Ready to serve, ${admin.name}!`);\n}\n```\n\nIn `init.js`, the first script of our app, we set `admin.name`. Then everyone will see it, including calls made from inside `admin.js` itself:\n\n```js\n// 📁 init.js\nimport {admin} from './admin.js';\nadmin.name = \"Pete\";\n```\n\nAnother module can also see `admin.name`:\n\n```js\n// 📁 other.js\nimport {admin, sayHi} from './admin.js';\n\nalert(admin.name); // *!*Pete*/!*\n\nsayHi(); // Ready to serve, *!*Pete*/!*!\n```\n\n### import.meta\n\nThe object `import.meta` contains the information about the current module.\n\nIts content depends on the environment. In the browser, it contains the url of the script, or a current webpage url if inside HTML:\n\n```html run height=0\n<script type=\"module\">\n  alert(import.meta.url); // script url (url of the html page for an inline script)\n</script>\n```\n\n### In a module, \"this\" is undefined\n\nThat's kind of a minor feature, but for completeness we should mention it.\n\nIn a module, top-level `this` is undefined.\n\nCompare it to non-module scripts, where `this` is a global object:\n\n```html run height=0\n<script>\n  alert(this); // window\n</script>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\n  alert(this); // undefined\n</script>\n```\n\n## Browser-specific features\n\nThere are also several browser-specific differences of scripts with `type=\"module\"` compared to regular ones.\n\nYou may want skip this section for now if you're reading for the first time, or if you don't use JavaScript in a browser.\n\n### Module scripts are deferred\n\nModule scripts are *always* deferred, same effect as `defer` attribute (described in the chapter [](info:script-async-defer)), for both external and inline scripts.\n\nIn other words:\n- downloading external module scripts `<script type=\"module\" src=\"...\">` doesn't block HTML processing, they load in parallel with other resources.\n- module scripts wait until the HTML document is fully ready (even if they are tiny and load faster than HTML), and then run.\n- relative order of scripts is maintained: scripts that go first in the document, execute first.\n\nAs a side-effect, module scripts always \"see\" the fully loaded HTML-page, including HTML elements below them.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run\n<script type=\"module\">\n*!*\n  alert(typeof button); // object: the script can 'see' the button below\n*/!*\n  // as modules are deferred, the script runs after the whole page is loaded\n</script>\n\nCompare to regular script below:\n\n<script>\n*!*\n  alert(typeof button); // Error: button is undefined, the script can't see elements below\n*/!*\n  // regular scripts run immediately, before the rest of the page is processed\n</script>\n\n<button id=\"button\">Button</button>\n```\n\nPlease note: the second script actually runs before the first! So we'll see `undefined` first, and then `object`.\n\nThat's because modules are deferred, so we wait for the document to be processed. The regular script runs immediately, so we see its output first.\n\nWhen using modules, we should be aware that the HTML page shows up as it loads, and JavaScript modules run after that, so the user may see the page before the JavaScript application is ready. Some functionality may not work yet. We should put \"loading indicators\", or otherwise ensure that the visitor won't be confused by that.\n\n### Async works on inline scripts\n\nFor non-module scripts, the `async` attribute only works on external scripts. Async scripts run immediately when ready, independently of other scripts or the HTML document.\n\nFor module scripts, it works on inline scripts as well.\n\nFor example, the inline script below has `async`, so it doesn't wait for anything.\n\nIt performs the import (fetches `./analytics.js`) and runs when ready, even if the HTML document is not finished yet, or if other scripts are still pending.\n\nThat's good for functionality that doesn't depend on anything, like counters, ads, document-level event listeners.\n\n```html\n<!-- all dependencies are fetched (analytics.js), and the script runs -->\n<!-- doesn't wait for the document or other <script> tags -->\n<script *!*async*/!* type=\"module\">\n  import {counter} from './analytics.js';\n\n  counter.count();\n</script>\n```\n\n### External scripts\n\nExternal scripts that have `type=\"module\"` are different in two aspects:\n\n1. External scripts with the same `src` run only once:\n    ```html\n    <!-- the script my.js is fetched and executed only once -->\n    <script type=\"module\" src=\"my.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"module\" src=\"my.js\"></script>\n    ```\n\n2. External scripts that are fetched from another origin (e.g. another site) require [CORS](mdn:Web/HTTP/CORS) headers, as described in the chapter <info:fetch-crossorigin>. In other words, if a module script is fetched from another origin, the remote server must supply a header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` allowing the fetch.\n    ```html\n    <!-- another-site.com must supply Access-Control-Allow-Origin -->\n    <!-- otherwise, the script won't execute -->\n    <script type=\"module\" src=\"*!*http://another-site.com/their.js*/!*\"></script>\n    ```\n\n    That ensures better security by default.\n\n### No \"bare\" modules allowed\n\nIn the browser, `import` must get either a relative or absolute URL. Modules without any path are called \"bare\" modules. Such modules are not allowed in `import`.\n\nFor instance, this `import` is invalid:\n```js\nimport {sayHi} from 'sayHi'; // Error, \"bare\" module\n// the module must have a path, e.g. './sayHi.js' or wherever the module is\n```\n\nCertain environments, like Node.js or bundle tools allow bare modules, without any path, as they have their own ways for finding modules and hooks to fine-tune them. But browsers do not support bare modules yet.\n\n### Compatibility, \"nomodule\"\n\nOld browsers do not understand `type=\"module\"`. Scripts of an unknown type are just ignored. For them, it's possible to provide a fallback using the `nomodule` attribute:\n\n```html run\n<script type=\"module\">\n  alert(\"Runs in modern browsers\");\n</script>\n\n<script nomodule>\n  alert(\"Modern browsers know both type=module and nomodule, so skip this\")\n  alert(\"Old browsers ignore script with unknown type=module, but execute this.\");\n</script>\n```\n\n## Build tools\n\nIn real-life, browser modules are rarely used in their \"raw\" form. Usually, we bundle them together with a special tool such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and deploy to the production server.\n\nOne of the benefits of using bundlers -- they give more control over how modules are resolved, allowing bare modules and much more, like CSS/HTML modules.\n\nBuild tools do the following:\n\n1. Take a \"main\" module, the one intended to be put in `<script type=\"module\">` in HTML.\n2. Analyze its dependencies: imports and then imports of imports etc.\n3. Build a single file with all modules (or multiple files, that's tunable), replacing native `import` calls with bundler functions, so that it works. \"Special\" module types like HTML/CSS modules are also supported.\n4. In the process, other transformations and optimizations may be applied:\n    - Unreachable code removed.\n    - Unused exports removed (\"tree-shaking\").\n    - Development-specific statements like `console` and `debugger` removed.\n    - Modern, bleeding-edge JavaScript syntax may be transformed to older one with similar functionality using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).\n    - The resulting file is minified (spaces removed, variables replaced with shorter names, etc).\n\nIf we use bundle tools, then as scripts are bundled together into a single file (or few files), `import/export` statements inside those scripts are replaced by special bundler functions. So the resulting \"bundled\" script does not contain any `import/export`, it doesn't require `type=\"module\"`, and we can put it into a regular script:\n\n```html\n<!-- Assuming we got bundle.js from a tool like Webpack -->\n<script src=\"bundle.js\"></script>\n```\n\nThat said, native modules are also usable. So we won't be using Webpack here: you can configure it later.\n\n## Summary\n\nTo summarize, the core concepts are:\n\n1. A module is a file. To make `import/export` work, browsers need `<script type=\"module\">`. Modules have several differences:\n    - Deferred by default.\n    - Async works on inline scripts.\n    - To load external scripts from another origin (domain/protocol/port), CORS headers are needed.\n    - Duplicate external scripts are ignored.\n2. Modules have their own, local top-level scope and interchange functionality via `import/export`.\n3. Modules always `use strict`.\n4. Module code is executed only once. Exports are created once and shared between importers.\n\nWhen we use modules, each module implements the functionality and exports it. Then we use `import` to directly import it where it's needed. The browser loads and evaluates the scripts automatically.\n\nIn production, people often use bundlers such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to bundle modules together for performance and other reasons.\n\nIn the next chapter we'll see more examples of modules, and how things can be exported/imported.",

        "content": "\n\nExport and import directives have several syntax variants.\n\nIn the previous article we saw a simple use, now let's explore more examples.\n\n## Export before declarations\n\nWe can label any declaration as exported by placing `export` before it, be it a variable, function or a class.\n\nFor instance, here all exports are valid:\n\n```js\n// export an array\n*!*export*/!* let months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar','Apr', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'];\n\n// export a constant\n*!*export*/!* const MODULES_BECAME_STANDARD_YEAR = 2015;\n\n// export a class\n*!*export*/!* class User {\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n````smart header=\"No semicolons after export class/function\"\nPlease note that `export` before a class or a function does not make it a [function expression](info:function-expressions). It's still a function declaration, albeit exported.\n\nMost JavaScript style guides don't recommend semicolons after function and class declarations.\n\nThat's why there's no need for a semicolon at the end of `export class` and `export function`:\n\n```js\nexport function sayHi(user) {\n  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);\n} *!* // no ; at the end */!*\n```\n\n````\n\n## Export apart from declarations\n\nAlso, we can put `export` separately.\n\nHere we first declare, and then export:\n\n```js  \n// 📁 say.js\nfunction sayHi(user) {\n  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);\n}\n\nfunction sayBye(user) {\n  alert(`Bye, ${user}!`);\n}\n\n*!*\nexport {sayHi, sayBye}; // a list of exported variables\n*/!*\n```\n\n...Or, technically we could put `export` above functions as well.\n\n## Import *\n\nUsually, we put a list of what to import in curly braces `import {...}`, like this:\n\n```js\n// 📁 main.js\n*!*\nimport {sayHi, sayBye} from './say.js';\n*/!*\n\nsayHi('John'); // Hello, John!\nsayBye('John'); // Bye, John!\n```\n\nBut if there's a lot to import, we can import everything as an object using `import * as <obj>`, for instance:\n\n```js\n// 📁 main.js\n*!*\nimport * as say from './say.js';\n*/!*\n\nsay.sayHi('John');\nsay.sayBye('John');\n```\n\nAt first sight, \"import everything\" seems such a cool thing, short to write, why should we ever explicitly list what we need to import?\n\nWell, there are few reasons.\n\n1. Modern build tools ([webpack](http://webpack.github.io) and others) bundle modules together and optimize them to speedup loading and remove unused stuff.\n\n    Let's say, we added a 3rd-party library `say.js` to our project with many functions:\n    ```js\n    // 📁 say.js\n    export function sayHi() { ... }\n    export function sayBye() { ... }\n    export function becomeSilent() { ... }\n    ```\n\n    Now if we only use one of `say.js` functions in our project:\n    ```js\n    // 📁 main.js\n    import {sayHi} from './say.js';\n    ```\n    ...Then the optimizer will see that and remove the other functions from the bundled code, thus making the build smaller. That is called \"tree-shaking\".\n\n2. Explicitly listing what to import gives shorter names: `sayHi()` instead of `say.sayHi()`.\n3. Explicit list of imports gives better overview of the code structure: what is used and where. It makes code support and refactoring easier.\n\n## Import \"as\"\n\nWe can also use `as` to import under different names.\n\nFor instance, let's import `sayHi` into the local variable `hi` for brevity, and import `sayBye` as `bye`:\n\n```js\n// 📁 main.js\n*!*\nimport {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye} from './say.js';\n*/!*\n\nhi('John'); // Hello, John!\nbye('John'); // Bye, John!\n```\n\n## Export \"as\"\n\nThe similar syntax exists for `export`.\n\nLet's export functions as `hi` and `bye`:\n\n```js\n// 📁 say.js\n...\nexport {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye};\n```\n\nNow `hi` and `bye` are official names for outsiders, to be used in imports:\n\n```js\n// 📁 main.js\nimport * as say from './say.js';\n\nsay.*!*hi*/!*('John'); // Hello, John!\nsay.*!*bye*/!*('John'); // Bye, John!\n```\n\n## Export default\n\nIn practice, there are mainly two kinds of modules.\n\n1. Modules that contain a library, pack of functions, like `say.js` above.\n2. Modules that declare a single entity, e.g. a module `user.js` exports only `class User`.\n\nMostly, the second approach is preferred, so that every \"thing\" resides in its own module.\n\nNaturally, that requires a lot of files, as everything wants its own module, but that's not a problem at all. Actually, code navigation becomes easier if files are well-named and structured into folders.\n\nModules provide a special `export default` (\"the default export\") syntax to make the \"one thing per module\" way look better.\n\nPut `export default` before the entity to export:\n\n```js\n// 📁 user.js\nexport *!*default*/!* class User { // just add \"default\"\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThere may be only one `export default` per file.\n\n...And then import it without curly braces:\n\n```js\n// 📁 main.js\nimport *!*User*/!* from './user.js'; // not {User}, just User\n\nnew User('John');\n```\n\nImports without curly braces look nicer. A common mistake when starting to use modules is to forget curly braces at all. So, remember, `import` needs curly braces for named exports and doesn't need them for the default one.\n\n| Named export | Default export |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| `export class User {...}` | `export default class User {...}` |\n| `import {User} from ...` | `import User from ...`|\n\nTechnically, we may have both default and named exports in a single module, but in practice people usually don't mix them. A module has either named exports or the default one.\n\nAs there may be at most one default export per file, the exported entity may have no name.\n\nFor instance, these are all perfectly valid default exports:\n\n```js\nexport default class { // no class name\n  constructor() { ... }\n}\n```\n\n```js\nexport default function(user) { // no function name\n  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);\n}\n```\n\n```js\n// export a single value, without making a variable\nexport default ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar','Apr', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'];\n```\n\nNot giving a name is fine, because there is only one `export default` per file, so `import` without curly braces knows what to import.\n\nWithout `default`, such an export would give an error:\n\n```js\nexport class { // Error! (non-default export needs a name)\n  constructor() {}\n}\n```     \n\n### The \"default\" name\n\nIn some situations the `default` keyword is used to reference the default export.\n\nFor example, to export a function separately from its definition:\n\n```js\nfunction sayHi(user) {\n  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);\n}\n\n// same as if we added \"export default\" before the function\nexport {sayHi as default};\n```\n\nOr, another situation, let's say a module `user.js` exports one main \"default\" thing, and a few named ones (rarely the case, but it happens):\n\n```js\n// 📁 user.js\nexport default class User {\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n}\n\nexport function sayHi(user) {\n  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);\n}\n```\n\nHere's how to import the default export along with a named one:\n\n```js\n// 📁 main.js\nimport {*!*default as User*/!*, sayHi} from './user.js';\n\nnew User('John');\n```\n\nAnd, finally, if importing everything `*` as an object, then the `default` property is exactly the default export:\n\n```js\n// 📁 main.js\nimport * as user from './user.js';\n\nlet User = user.default; // the default export\nnew User('John');\n```\n\n### A word against default exports\n\nNamed exports are explicit. They exactly name what they import, so we have that information from them; that's a good thing.\n\nNamed exports force us to use exactly the right name to import:\n\n```js\nimport {User} from './user.js';\n// import {MyUser} won't work, the name must be {User}\n```\n\n...While for a default export, we always choose the name when importing:\n\n```js\nimport User from './user.js'; // works\nimport MyUser from './user.js'; // works too\n// could be import Anything... and it'll still work\n```\n\nSo team members may use different names to import the same thing, and that's not good.\n\nUsually, to avoid that and keep the code consistent, there's a rule that imported variables should correspond to file names, e.g:\n\n```js\nimport User from './user.js';\nimport LoginForm from './loginForm.js';\nimport func from '/path/to/func.js';\n...\n```\n\nStill, some teams consider it a serious drawback of default exports. So they prefer to always use named exports. Even if only a single thing is exported, it's still exported under a name, without `default`.\n\nThat also makes re-export (see below) a little bit easier.\n\n## Re-export\n\n\"Re-export\" syntax `export ... from ...` allows to import things and immediately export them (possibly under another name), like this:\n\n```js\nexport {sayHi} from './say.js'; // re-export sayHi\n\nexport {default as User} from './user.js'; // re-export default\n```\n\nWhy would that be needed? Let's see a practical use case.\n\nImagine, we're writing a \"package\": a folder with a lot of modules, with some of the functionality exported outside (tools like NPM allow us to publish and distribute such packages), and many modules are just \"helpers\", for internal use in other package modules.\n\nThe file structure could be like this:\n```\nauth/\n    index.js  \n    user.js\n    helpers.js\n    tests/\n        login.js\n    providers/\n        github.js\n        facebook.js\n        ...\n```\n\nWe'd like to expose the package functionality via a single entry point, the \"main file\" `auth/index.js`, to be used like this:\n\n```js\nimport {login, logout} from 'auth/index.js'\n```\n\nThe idea is that outsiders, developers who use our package, should not meddle with its internal structure, search for files inside our package folder. We export only what's necessary in `auth/index.js` and keep the rest hidden from prying eyes.\n\nAs the actual exported functionality is scattered among the package, we can import it into `auth/index.js` and export from it:\n\n```js\n// 📁 auth/index.js\n\n// import login/logout and immediately export them\nimport {login, logout} from './helpers.js';\nexport {login, logout};\n\n// import default as User and export it\nimport User from './user.js';\nexport {User};\n...\n```\n\nNow users of our package can `import {login} from \"auth/index.js\"`.\n\nThe syntax `export ... from ...` is just a shorter notation for such import-export:\n\n```js\n// 📁 auth/index.js\n// import login/logout and immediately export them\nexport {login, logout} from './helpers.js';\n\n// import default as User and export it\nexport {default as User} from './user.js';\n...\n```\n\n### Re-exporting the default export\n\nThe default export needs separate handling when re-exporting.\n\nLet's say we have `user.js`, and we'd like to re-export class `User` from it:\n\n```js\n// 📁 user.js\nexport default class User {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n1. `export User from './user.js'` won't work. What can go wrong?... But that's a syntax error!\n\n    To re-export the default export, we have to write `export {default as User}`, as in the example above.    \n\n2. `export * from './user.js'` re-exports only named exports, but ignores the default one.\n\n    If we'd like to re-export both named and the default export, then two statements are needed:\n    ```js\n    export * from './user.js'; // to re-export named exports\n    export {default} from './user.js'; // to re-export the default export\n    ```\n\nSuch oddities of re-exporting the default export are one of the reasons why some developers don't like them.\n\n## Summary\n\nHere are all types of `export` that we covered in this and previous articles.\n\nYou can check yourself by reading them and recalling what they mean:\n\n- Before declaration of a class/function/..:\n  - `export [default] class/function/variable ...`\n- Standalone export:\n  - `export {x [as y], ...}`.\n- Re-export:\n  - `export {x [as y], ...} from \"module\"`\n  - `export * from \"module\"` (doesn't re-export default).\n  - `export {default [as y]} from \"module\"` (re-export default).\n\nImport:\n\n- Named exports from module:\n  - `import {x [as y], ...} from \"module\"`\n- Default export:  \n  - `import x from \"module\"`\n  - `import {default as x} from \"module\"`\n- Everything:\n  - `import * as obj from \"module\"`\n- Import the module (its code runs), but do not assign it to a variable:\n  - `import \"module\"`\n\nWe can put `import/export` statements at the top or at the bottom of a script, that doesn't matter.\n\nSo, technically this code is fine:\n```js\nsayHi();\n\n// ...\n\nimport {sayHi} from './say.js'; // import at the end of the file\n```\n\nIn practice imports are usually at the start of the file, but that's only for more convenience.\n\n**Please note that import/export statements don't work if inside `{...}`.**\n\nA conditional import, like this, won't work:\n```js\nif (something) {\n  import {sayHi} from \"./say.js\"; // Error: import must be at top level\n}\n```\n\n...But what if we really need to import something conditionally? Or at the right time? Like, load a module upon request, when it's really needed?\n\nWe'll see dynamic imports in the next article.",

The syntax is very simple and strict.\n\nFirst, we can't dynamically generate any parameters of `import`.\n\nThe module path must be a primitive string, can't be a function call. This won't work:\n\n```js\nimport ... from *!*getModuleName()*/!*; // Error, only from \"string\" is allowed\n```\n\nSecond, we can't import conditionally or at run-time:\n\n```js\nif(...) {\n  import ...; // Error, not allowed!\n}\n\n{\n  import ...; // Error, we can't put import in any block\n}\n```\n\nThat's because `import`/`export` aim to provide a backbone for the code structure. That's a good thing, as code structure can be analyzed, modules can be gathered and bundled into one file by special tools, unused exports can be removed (\"tree-shaken\"). That's possible only because the structure of imports/exports is simple and fixed.\n\nBut how can we import a module dynamically, on-demand?\n\n## The import() expression\n\nThe `import(module)` expression loads the module and returns a promise that resolves into a module object that contains all its exports. It can be called from any place in the code.\n\nWe can use it dynamically in any place of the code, for instance:\n\n```js\nlet modulePath = prompt(\"Which module to load?\");\n\nimport(modulePath)\n  .then(obj => <module object>)\n  .catch(err => <loading error, e.g. if no such module>)\n```\n\nOr, we could use `let module = await import(modulePath)` if inside an async function.\n\nFor instance, if we have the following module `say.js`:\n\n```js\n// 📁 say.js\nexport function hi() {\n  alert(`Hello`);\n}\n\nexport function bye() {\n  alert(`Bye`);\n}\n```\n\n...Then dynamic import can be like this:\n\n```js\nlet {hi, bye} = await import('./say.js');\n\nhi();\nbye();\n```\n\nOr, if `say.js` has the default export:\n\n```js\n// 📁 say.js\nexport default function() {\n  alert(\"Module loaded (export default)!\");\n}\n```\n\n...Then, in order to access it, we can use `default` property of the module object:\n\n```js\nlet obj = await import('./say.js');\nlet say = obj.default;\n// or, in one line: let {default: say} = await import('./say.js');\n\nsay();\n```\n\nHere's the full example:\n\n[codetabs src=\"say\" current=\"index.html\"]\n\n```smart\nDynamic imports work in regular scripts, they don't require `script type=\"module\"`.\n```\n\n```smart\nAlthough `import()` looks like a function call, it's a special syntax that just happens to use parentheses (similar to `super()`).\n\nSo we can't copy `import` to a variable or use `call/apply` with it. It's not a function.\n```",

        "content": "\n\nA `Proxy` object wraps another object and intercepts operations, like reading/writing properties and others, optionally handling them on its own, or transparently allowing the object to handle them.\n\nProxies are used in many libraries and some browser frameworks. We'll see many practical applications in this article.\n\n## Proxy\n\nThe syntax:\n\n```js\nlet proxy = new Proxy(target, handler)\n```\n\n- `target` -- is an object to wrap, can be anything, including functions.\n- `handler` -- proxy configuration: an object with \"traps\", methods that intercept operations. - e.g. `get` trap for reading a property of `target`, `set` trap for writing a property into `target`, and so on.\n\nFor operations on `proxy`, if there's a corresponding trap in `handler`, then it runs, and the proxy has a chance to handle it, otherwise the operation is performed on `target`.\n\nAs a starting example, let's create a proxy without any traps:\n\n```js run\nlet target = {};\nlet proxy = new Proxy(target, {}); // empty handler\n\nproxy.test = 5; // writing to proxy (1)\nalert(target.test); // 5, the property appeared in target!\n\nalert(proxy.test); // 5, we can read it from proxy too (2)\n\nfor(let key in proxy) alert(key); // test, iteration works (3)\n```\n\nAs there are no traps, all operations on `proxy` are forwarded to `target`.\n\n1. A writing operation `proxy.test=` sets the value on `target`.\n2. A reading operation `proxy.test` returns the value from `target`.\n3. Iteration over `proxy` returns values from `target`.\n\nAs we can see, without any traps, `proxy` is a transparent wrapper around `target`.\n\n![](proxy.svg)  \n\n`Proxy` is a special \"exotic object\". It doesn't have own properties. With an empty `handler` it transparently forwards operations to `target`.\n\nTo activate more capabilities, let's add traps.\n\nWhat can we intercept with them?\n\nFor most operations on objects, there's a so-called \"internal method\" in the JavaScript specification that describes how it works at the lowest level. For instance `[[Get]]`, the internal method to read a property, `[[Set]]`, the internal method to write a property, and so on. These methods are only used in the specification, we can't call them directly by name.\n\nProxy traps intercept invocations of these methods. They are listed in the [Proxy specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-proxy-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots) and in the table below.\n\nFor every internal method, there's a trap in this table: the name of the method that we can add to the `handler` parameter of `new Proxy` to intercept the operation:\n\n| Internal Method | Handler Method | Triggers when... |\n|-----------------|----------------|-------------|\n| `[[Get]]` | `get` | reading a property |\n| `[[Set]]` | `set` | writing to a property |\n| `[[HasProperty]]` | `has` | `in` operator |\n| `[[Delete]]` | `deleteProperty` | `delete` operator |\n| `[[Call]]` | `apply` | function call |\n| `[[Construct]]` | `construct` | `new` operator |\n| `[[GetPrototypeOf]]` | `getPrototypeOf` | [Object.getPrototypeOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getPrototypeOf) |\n| `[[SetPrototypeOf]]` | `setPrototypeOf` | [Object.setPrototypeOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/setPrototypeOf) |\n| `[[IsExtensible]]` | `isExtensible` | [Object.isExtensible](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/isExtensible) |\n| `[[PreventExtensions]]` | `preventExtensions` | [Object.preventExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/preventExtensions) |\n| `[[DefineOwnProperty]]` | `defineProperty` | [Object.defineProperty](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty), [Object.defineProperties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperties) |\n| `[[GetOwnProperty]]` | `getOwnPropertyDescriptor` | [Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertyDescriptor), `for..in`, `Object.keys/values/entries` |\n| `[[OwnPropertyKeys]]` | `ownKeys` | [Object.getOwnPropertyNames](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertyNames), [Object.getOwnPropertySymbols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertySymbols), `for..in`, `Object/keys/values/entries` |\n\n```warn header=\"Invariants\"\nJavaScript enforces some invariants -- conditions that must be fulfilled by internal methods and traps.\n\nMost of them are for return values:\n- `[[Set]]` must return `true` if the value was written successfully, otherwise `false`.\n- `[[Delete]]` must return `true` if the value was deleted successfully, otherwise `false`.\n- ...and so on, we'll see more in examples below.\n\nThere are some other invariants, like:\n- `[[GetPrototypeOf]]`, applied to the proxy object must return the same value as `[[GetPrototypeOf]]` applied to the proxy object's target object. In other words, reading prototype of a proxy must always return the prototype of the target object.\n\nTraps can intercept these operations, but they must follow these rules.\n\nInvariants ensure correct and consistent behavior of language features. The full invariants list is in [the specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-proxy-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots). You probably won't violate them if you're not doing something weird.\n```\n\nLet's see how that works in practical examples.\n\n## Default value with \"get\" trap\n\nThe most common traps are for reading/writing properties.\n\nTo intercept reading, the `handler` should have a method `get(target, property, receiver)`.\n\nIt triggers when a property is read, with following arguments:\n\n- `target` -- is the target object, the one passed as the first argument to `new Proxy`,\n- `property` -- property name,\n- `receiver` -- if the target property is a getter, then `receiver` is the object that's going to be used as `this` in its call. Usually that's the `proxy` object itself (or an object that inherits from it, if we inherit from proxy). Right now we don't need this argument, so it will be explained in more detail later.\n\nLet's use `get` to implement default values for an object.\n\nWe'll make a numeric array that returns `0` for nonexistent values.\n\nUsually when one tries to get a non-existing array item, they get `undefined`, but we'll wrap a regular array into the proxy that traps reading and returns `0` if there's no such property:\n\n```js run\nlet numbers = [0, 1, 2];\n\nnumbers = new Proxy(numbers, {\n  get(target, prop) {\n    if (prop in target) {\n      return target[prop];\n    } else {\n      return 0; // default value\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n*!*\nalert( numbers[1] ); // 1\nalert( numbers[123] ); // 0 (no such item)\n*/!*\n```\n\nAs we can see, it's quite easy to do with a `get` trap.\n\nWe can use `Proxy` to implement any logic for \"default\" values.\n\nImagine we have a dictionary, with phrases and their translations:\n\n```js run\nlet dictionary = {\n  'Hello': 'Hola',\n  'Bye': 'Adiós'\n};\n\nalert( dictionary['Hello'] ); // Hola\nalert( dictionary['Welcome'] ); // undefined\n```\n\nRight now, if there's no phrase, reading from `dictionary` returns `undefined`. But in practice, leaving a phrase untranslated is usually better than `undefined`. So let's make it return an untranslated phrase in that case instead of `undefined`.\n\nTo achieve that, we'll wrap `dictionary` in a proxy that intercepts reading operations:\n\n```js run\nlet dictionary = {\n  'Hello': 'Hola',\n  'Bye': 'Adiós'\n};\n\ndictionary = new Proxy(dictionary, {\n*!*\n  get(target, phrase) { // intercept reading a property from dictionary\n*/!*\n    if (phrase in target) { // if we have it in the dictionary\n      return target[phrase]; // return the translation\n    } else {\n      // otherwise, return the non-translated phrase\n      return phrase;\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n// Look up arbitrary phrases in the dictionary!\n// At worst, they're not translated.\nalert( dictionary['Hello'] ); // Hola\n*!*\nalert( dictionary['Welcome to Proxy']); // Welcome to Proxy (no translation)\n*/!*\n```\n\n````smart\nPlease note how the proxy overwrites the variable:\n\n```js\ndictionary = new Proxy(dictionary, ...);\n```\n\nThe proxy should totally replace the target object everywhere. No one should ever reference the target object after it got proxied. Otherwise it's easy to mess up.\n````\n\n## Validation with \"set\" trap\n\nLet's say we want an array exclusively for numbers. If a value of another type is added, there should be an error.\n\nThe `set` trap triggers when a property is written.\n\n`set(target, property, value, receiver)`:\n\n- `target` -- is the target object, the one passed as the first argument to `new Proxy`,\n- `property` -- property name,\n- `value` -- property value,\n- `receiver` -- similar to `get` trap, matters only for setter properties.\n\nThe `set` trap should return `true` if setting is successful, and `false` otherwise (triggers `TypeError`).\n\nLet's use it to validate new values:\n\n```js run\nlet numbers = [];\n\nnumbers = new Proxy(numbers, { // (*)\n*!*\n  set(target, prop, val) { // to intercept property writing\n*/!*\n    if (typeof val == 'number') {\n      target[prop] = val;\n      return true;\n    } else {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nnumbers.push(1); // added successfully\nnumbers.push(2); // added successfully\nalert(\"Length is: \" + numbers.length); // 2\n\n*!*\nnumbers.push(\"test\"); // TypeError ('set' on proxy returned false)\n*/!*\n\nalert(\"This line is never reached (error in the line above)\");\n```\n\nPlease note: the built-in functionality of arrays is still working! Values are added by `push`. The `length` property auto-increases when values are added. Our proxy doesn't break anything.\n\nWe don't have to override value-adding array methods like `push` and `unshift`, and so on, to add checks in there, because internally they use the `[[Set]]` operation that's intercepted by the proxy.\n\nSo the code is clean and concise.\n\n```warn header=\"Don't forget to return `true`\"\nAs said above, there are invariants to be held.\n\nFor `set`, it must return `true` for a successful write.\n\nIf we forget to do it or return any falsy value, the operation triggers `TypeError`.\n```\n\n## Iteration with \"ownKeys\" and \"getOwnPropertyDescriptor\"\n\n`Object.keys`, `for..in` loop and most other methods that iterate over object properties use `[[OwnPropertyKeys]]` internal method (intercepted by `ownKeys` trap) to get a list of properties.\n\nSuch methods differ in details:\n- `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)` returns non-symbol keys.\n- `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(obj)` returns symbol keys.\n- `Object.keys/values()` returns non-symbol keys/values with `enumerable` flag (property flags were explained in the article <info:property-descriptors>).\n- `for..in` loops over non-symbol keys with `enumerable` flag, and also prototype keys.\n\n...But all of them start with that list.\n\nIn the example below we use `ownKeys` trap to make `for..in` loop over `user`, and also `Object.keys` and `Object.values`, to skip properties starting with an underscore `_`:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30,\n  _password: \"***\"\n};\n\nuser = new Proxy(user, {\n*!*\n  ownKeys(target) {\n*/!*\n    return Object.keys(target).filter(key => !key.startsWith('_'));\n  }\n});\n\n// \"ownKeys\" filters out _password\nfor(let key in user) alert(key); // name, then: age\n\n// same effect on these methods:\nalert( Object.keys(user) ); // name,age\nalert( Object.values(user) ); // John,30\n```\n\nSo far, it works.\n\nAlthough, if we return a key that doesn't exist in the object, `Object.keys` won't list it:\n\n```js run\nlet user = { };\n\nuser = new Proxy(user, {\n*!*\n  ownKeys(target) {\n*/!*\n    return ['a', 'b', 'c'];\n  }\n});\n\nalert( Object.keys(user) ); // <empty>\n```\n\nWhy? The reason is simple: `Object.keys` returns only properties with the `enumerable` flag. To check for it, it calls the internal method `[[GetOwnProperty]]` for every property to get [its descriptor](info:property-descriptors). And here, as there's no property, its descriptor is empty, no `enumerable` flag, so it's skipped.\n\nFor `Object.keys` to return a property, we need it to either exist in the object, with the `enumerable` flag, or we can intercept calls to `[[GetOwnProperty]]` (the trap `getOwnPropertyDescriptor` does it), and return a descriptor with `enumerable: true`.\n\nHere's an example of that:\n\n```js run\nlet user = { };\n\nuser = new Proxy(user, {\n  ownKeys(target) { // called once to get a list of properties\n    return ['a', 'b', 'c'];\n  },\n\n  getOwnPropertyDescriptor(target, prop) { // called for every property\n    return {\n      enumerable: true,\n      configurable: true\n      /* ...other flags, probable \"value:...\" */\n    };\n  }\n\n});\n\nalert( Object.keys(user) ); // a, b, c\n```\n\nLet's note once again: we only need to intercept `[[GetOwnProperty]]` if the property is absent in the object.\n\n## Protected properties with \"deleteProperty\" and other traps\n\nThere's a widespread convention that properties and methods prefixed by an underscore `_` are internal. They shouldn't be accessed from outside the object.\n\nTechnically that's possible though:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  _password: \"secret\"\n};\n\nalert(user._password); // secret  \n```\n\nLet's use proxies to prevent any access to properties starting with `_`.\n\nWe'll need the traps:\n- `get` to throw an error when reading such property,\n- `set` to throw an error when writing,\n- `deleteProperty` to throw an error when deleting,\n- `ownKeys` to exclude properties starting with `_` from `for..in` and methods like `Object.keys`.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  _password: \"***\"\n};\n\nuser = new Proxy(user, {\n*!*\n  get(target, prop) {\n*/!*\n    if (prop.startsWith('_')) {\n      throw new Error(\"Access denied\");\n    }\n    let value = target[prop];\n    return (typeof value === 'function') ? value.bind(target) : value; // (*)\n  },\n*!*\n  set(target, prop, val) { // to intercept property writing\n*/!*\n    if (prop.startsWith('_')) {\n      throw new Error(\"Access denied\");\n    } else {\n      target[prop] = val;\n      return true;\n    }\n  },\n*!*\n  deleteProperty(target, prop) { // to intercept property deletion\n*/!*  \n    if (prop.startsWith('_')) {\n      throw new Error(\"Access denied\");\n    } else {\n      delete target[prop];\n      return true;\n    }\n  },\n*!*\n  ownKeys(target) { // to intercept property list\n*/!*\n    return Object.keys(target).filter(key => !key.startsWith('_'));\n  }\n});\n\n// \"get\" doesn't allow to read _password\ntry {\n  alert(user._password); // Error: Access denied\n} catch(e) { alert(e.message); }\n\n// \"set\" doesn't allow to write _password\ntry {\n  user._password = \"test\"; // Error: Access denied\n} catch(e) { alert(e.message); }\n\n// \"deleteProperty\" doesn't allow to delete _password\ntry {\n  delete user._password; // Error: Access denied\n} catch(e) { alert(e.message); }\n\n// \"ownKeys\" filters out _password\nfor(let key in user) alert(key); // name\n```\n\nPlease note the important detail in the `get` trap, in the line `(*)`:\n\n```js\nget(target, prop) {\n  // ...\n  let value = target[prop];\n*!*\n  return (typeof value === 'function') ? value.bind(target) : value; // (*)\n*/!*\n}\n```\n\nWhy do we need a function to call `value.bind(target)`?\n\nThe reason is that object methods, such as `user.checkPassword()`, must be able to access `_password`:\n\n```js\nuser = {\n  // ...\n  checkPassword(value) {\n    // object method must be able to read _password\n    return value === this._password;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\nA call to `user.checkPassword()` call gets proxied `user` as `this` (the object before dot becomes `this`), so when it tries to access `this._password`, the `get` trap activates (it triggers on any property read) and throws an error.\n\nSo we bind the context of object methods to the original object, `target`, in the line `(*)`. Then their future calls will use `target` as `this`, without any traps.\n\nThat solution usually works, but isn't ideal, as a method may pass the unproxied object somewhere else, and then we'll get messed up: where's the original object, and where's the proxied one?\n\nBesides, an object may be proxied multiple times (multiple proxies may add different \"tweaks\" to the object), and if we pass an unwrapped object to a method, there may be unexpected consequences.\n\nSo, such a proxy shouldn't be used everywhere.\n\n```smart header=\"Private properties of a class\"\nModern JavaScript engines natively support private properties in classes, prefixed with `#`. They are described in the article <info:private-protected-properties-methods>. No proxies required.\n\nSuch properties have their own issues though. In particular, they are not inherited.\n```\n\n## \"In range\" with \"has\" trap\n\nLet's see more examples.\n\nWe have a range object:\n\n```js\nlet range = {\n  start: 1,\n  end: 10\n};\n```\n\nWe'd like to use the `in` operator to check that a number is in `range`.\n\nThe `has` trap intercepts `in` calls.\n\n`has(target, property)`\n\n- `target` -- is the target object, passed as the first argument to `new Proxy`,\n- `property` -- property name\n\nHere's the demo:\n\n```js run\nlet range = {\n  start: 1,\n  end: 10\n};\n\nrange = new Proxy(range, {\n*!*\n  has(target, prop) {\n*/!*\n    return prop >= target.start && prop <= target.end;\n  }\n});\n\n*!*\nalert(5 in range); // true\nalert(50 in range); // false\n*/!*\n```\n\nNice syntactic sugar, isn't it? And very simple to implement.\n\n## Wrapping functions: \"apply\" [#proxy-apply]\n\nWe can wrap a proxy around a function as well.\n\nThe `apply(target, thisArg, args)` trap handles calling a proxy as function:\n\n- `target` is the target object (function is an object in JavaScript),\n- `thisArg` is the value of `this`.\n- `args` is a list of arguments.\n\nFor example, let's recall `delay(f, ms)` decorator, that we did in the article <info:call-apply-decorators>.\n\nIn that article we did it without proxies. A call to `delay(f, ms)` returned a function that forwards all calls to `f` after `ms` milliseconds.\n\nHere's the previous, function-based implementation:\n\n```js run\nfunction delay(f, ms) {\n  // return a wrapper that passes the call to f after the timeout\n  return function() { // (*)\n    setTimeout(() => f.apply(this, arguments), ms);\n  };\n}\n\nfunction sayHi(user) {\n  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);\n}\n\n// after this wrapping, calls to sayHi will be delayed for 3 seconds\nsayHi = delay(sayHi, 3000);\n\nsayHi(\"John\"); // Hello, John! (after 3 seconds)\n```\n\nAs we've seen already, that mostly works. The wrapper function `(*)` performs the call after the timeout.\n\nBut a wrapper function does not forward property read/write operations or anything else. After the wrapping, the access is lost to properties of the original functions, such as `name`, `length` and others:\n\n```js run\nfunction delay(f, ms) {\n  return function() {\n    setTimeout(() => f.apply(this, arguments), ms);\n  };\n}\n\nfunction sayHi(user) {\n  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);\n}\n\n*!*\nalert(sayHi.length); // 1 (function length is the arguments count in its declaration)\n*/!*\n\nsayHi = delay(sayHi, 3000);\n\n*!*\nalert(sayHi.length); // 0 (in the wrapper declaration, there are zero arguments)\n*/!*\n```\n\n`Proxy` is much more powerful, as it forwards everything to the target object.\n\nLet's use `Proxy` instead of a wrapping function:\n\n```js run\nfunction delay(f, ms) {\n  return new Proxy(f, {\n    apply(target, thisArg, args) {\n      setTimeout(() => target.apply(thisArg, args), ms);\n    }\n  });\n}\n\nfunction sayHi(user) {\n  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);\n}\n\nsayHi = delay(sayHi, 3000);\n\n*!*\nalert(sayHi.length); // 1 (*) proxy forwards \"get length\" operation to the target\n*/!*\n\nsayHi(\"John\"); // Hello, John! (after 3 seconds)\n```\n\nThe result is the same, but now not only calls, but all operations on the proxy are forwarded to the original function. So `sayHi.length` is returned correctly after the wrapping in the line `(*)`.\n\nWe've got a \"richer\" wrapper.\n\nOther traps exist: the full list is in the beginning of this article. Their usage pattern is similar to the above.\n\n## Reflect\n\n`Reflect` is a built-in object that simplifies creation of `Proxy`.\n\nIt was said previously that internal methods, such as `[[Get]]`, `[[Set]]` and others are specification-only, they can't be called directly.\n\nThe `Reflect` object makes that somewhat possible. Its methods are minimal wrappers around the internal methods.\n\nHere are examples of operations and `Reflect` calls that do the same:\n\n| Operation |  `Reflect` call | Internal method |\n|-----------------|----------------|-------------|\n| `obj[prop]` | `Reflect.get(obj, prop)` | `[[Get]]` |\n| `obj[prop] = value` | `Reflect.set(obj, prop, value)` | `[[Set]]` |\n| `delete obj[prop]` | `Reflect.deleteProperty(obj, prop)` | `[[Delete]]` |\n| `new F(value)` | `Reflect.construct(F, value)` | `[[Construct]]` |\n| ... | ... | ... |\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {};\n\nReflect.set(user, 'name', 'John');\n\nalert(user.name); // John\n```\n\nIn particular, `Reflect` allows us to call operators (`new`, `delete`...) as functions (`Reflect.construct`, `Reflect.deleteProperty`, ...). That's an interesting capability, but here another thing is important.\n\n**For every internal method, trappable by `Proxy`, there's a corresponding method in `Reflect`, with the same name and arguments as the `Proxy` trap.**\n\nSo we can use `Reflect` to forward an operation to the original object.\n\nIn this example, both traps `get` and `set` transparently (as if they didn't exist) forward reading/writing operations to the object, showing a message:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n};\n\nuser = new Proxy(user, {\n  get(target, prop, receiver) {\n    alert(`GET ${prop}`);\n*!*\n    return Reflect.get(target, prop, receiver); // (1)\n*/!*\n  },\n  set(target, prop, val, receiver) {\n    alert(`SET ${prop}=${val}`);\n*!*\n    return Reflect.set(target, prop, val, receiver); // (2)\n*/!*\n  }\n});\n\nlet name = user.name; // shows \"GET name\"\nuser.name = \"Pete\"; // shows \"SET name=Pete\"\n```\n\nHere:\n\n- `Reflect.get` reads an object property.\n- `Reflect.set` writes an object property and returns `true` if successful, `false` otherwise.\n\nThat is, everything's simple: if a trap wants to forward the call to the object, it's enough to call `Reflect.<method>` with the same arguments.\n\nIn most cases we can do the same without `Reflect`, for instance, reading a property `Reflect.get(target, prop, receiver)` can be replaced by `target[prop]`. There are important nuances though.\n\n### Proxying a getter\n\nLet's see an example that demonstrates why `Reflect.get` is better. And we'll also see why `get/set` have the third argument `receiver`, that we didn't use before.\n\nWe have an object `user` with `_name` property and a getter for it.\n\nHere's a proxy around it:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  _name: \"Guest\",\n  get name() {\n    return this._name;\n  }\n};\n\n*!*\nlet userProxy = new Proxy(user, {\n  get(target, prop, receiver) {\n    return target[prop];\n  }\n});\n*/!*\n\nalert(userProxy.name); // Guest\n```\n\nThe `get` trap is \"transparent\" here, it returns the original property, and doesn't do anything else. That's enough for our example.\n\nEverything seems to be all right. But let's make the example a little bit more complex.\n\nAfter inheriting another object `admin` from `user`, we can observe the incorrect behavior:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  _name: \"Guest\",\n  get name() {\n    return this._name;\n  }\n};\n\nlet userProxy = new Proxy(user, {\n  get(target, prop, receiver) {\n    return target[prop]; // (*) target = user\n  }\n});\n\n*!*\nlet admin = {\n  __proto__: userProxy,\n  _name: \"Admin\"\n};\n\n// Expected: Admin\nalert(admin.name); // outputs: Guest (?!?)\n*/!*\n```\n\nReading `admin.name` should return `\"Admin\"`, not `\"Guest\"`!\n\nWhat's the matter? Maybe we did something wrong with the inheritance?\n\nBut if we remove the proxy, then everything will work as expected.\n\nThe problem is actually in the proxy, in the line `(*)`.\n\n1. When we read `admin.name`, as `admin` object doesn't have such own property, the search goes to its prototype.\n2. The prototype is `userProxy`.\n3. When reading `name` property from the proxy, its `get` trap triggers and returns it from the original object as `target[prop]` in the line `(*)`.\n\n    A call to `target[prop]`, when `prop` is a getter, runs its code in the context `this=target`. So the result is `this._name` from the original object `target`, that is: from `user`.\n\nTo fix such situations, we need `receiver`, the third argument of `get` trap. It keeps the correct `this` to be passed to a getter. In our case that's `admin`.\n\nHow to pass the context for a getter? For a regular function we could use `call/apply`, but that's a getter, it's not \"called\", just accessed.\n\n`Reflect.get` can do that. Everything will work right if we use it.\n\nHere's the corrected variant:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  _name: \"Guest\",\n  get name() {\n    return this._name;\n  }\n};\n\nlet userProxy = new Proxy(user, {\n  get(target, prop, receiver) { // receiver = admin\n*!*\n    return Reflect.get(target, prop, receiver); // (*)\n*/!*\n  }\n});\n\n\nlet admin = {\n  __proto__: userProxy,\n  _name: \"Admin\"\n};\n\n*!*\nalert(admin.name); // Admin\n*/!*\n```\n\nNow `receiver` that keeps a reference to the correct `this` (that is `admin`), is passed to the getter using `Reflect.get` in the line `(*)`.\n\nWe can rewrite the trap even shorter:\n\n```js\nget(target, prop, receiver) {\n  return Reflect.get(*!*...arguments*/!*);\n}\n```\n\n\n`Reflect` calls are named exactly the same way as traps and accept the same arguments. They were specifically designed this way.\n\nSo, `return Reflect...` provides a safe no-brainer to forward the operation and make sure we don't forget anything related to that.\n\n## Proxy limitations\n\nProxies provide a unique way to alter or tweak the behavior of the existing objects at the lowest level. Still, it's not perfect. There are limitations.\n\n### Built-in objects: Internal slots\n\nMany built-in objects, for example `Map`, `Set`, `Date`, `Promise` and others make use of so-called \"internal slots\".\n\nThese are like properties, but reserved for internal, specification-only purposes. For instance, `Map` stores items in the internal slot `[[MapData]]`. Built-in methods access them directly, not via `[[Get]]/[[Set]]` internal methods. So `Proxy` can't intercept that.\n\nWhy care? They're internal anyway!\n\nWell, here's the issue. After a built-in object like that gets proxied, the proxy doesn't have these internal slots, so built-in methods will fail.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nlet map = new Map();\n\nlet proxy = new Proxy(map, {});\n\n*!*\nproxy.set('test', 1); // Error\n*/!*\n```\n\nInternally, a `Map` stores all data in its `[[MapData]]` internal slot. The proxy doesn't have such a slot. The [built-in method `Map.prototype.set`](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-map.prototype.set) method tries to access the internal property `this.[[MapData]]`, but because `this=proxy`, can't find it in `proxy` and just fails.\n\nFortunately, there's a way to fix it:\n\n```js run\nlet map = new Map();\n\nlet proxy = new Proxy(map, {\n  get(target, prop, receiver) {\n    let value = Reflect.get(...arguments);\n*!*\n    return typeof value == 'function' ? value.bind(target) : value;\n*/!*\n  }\n});\n\nproxy.set('test', 1);\nalert(proxy.get('test')); // 1 (works!)\n```\n\nNow it works fine, because `get` trap binds function properties, such as `map.set`, to the target object (`map`) itself.\n\nUnlike the previous example, the value of `this` inside `proxy.set(...)` will be not `proxy`, but the original `map`. So when the internal implementation of `set` tries to access `this.[[MapData]]` internal slot, it succeeds.\n\n```smart header=\"`Array` has no internal slots\"\nA notable exception: built-in `Array` doesn't use internal slots. That's for historical reasons, as it appeared so long ago.\n\nSo there's no such problem when proxying an array.\n```\n\n### Private fields\n\nThe similar thing happens with private class fields.\n\nFor example, `getName()` method accesses the private `#name` property and breaks after proxying:\n\n```js run\nclass User {\n  #name = \"Guest\";\n\n  getName() {\n    return this.#name;\n  }\n}\n\nlet user = new User();\n\nuser = new Proxy(user, {});\n\n*!*\nalert(user.getName()); // Error\n*/!*\n```\n\nThe reason is that private fields are implemented using internal slots. JavaScript does not use `[[Get]]/[[Set]]` when accessing them.\n\nIn the call `getName()` the value of `this` is the proxied `user`, and it doesn't have the slot with private fields.\n\nOnce again, the solution with binding the method makes it work:\n\n```js run\nclass User {\n  #name = \"Guest\";\n\n  getName() {\n    return this.#name;\n  }\n}\n\nlet user = new User();\n\nuser = new Proxy(user, {\n  get(target, prop, receiver) {\n    let value = Reflect.get(...arguments);\n    return typeof value == 'function' ? value.bind(target) : value;\n  }\n});\n\nalert(user.getName()); // Guest\n```\n\nThat said, the solution has drawbacks, as explained previously: it exposes the original object to the method, potentially allowing it to be passed further and breaking other proxied functionality.\n\n### Proxy != target\n\nThe proxy and the original object are different objects. That's natural, right?\n\nSo if we use the original object as a key, and then proxy it, then the proxy can't be found:\n\n```js run\nlet allUsers = new Set();\n\nclass User {\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n    allUsers.add(this);\n  }\n}\n\nlet user = new User(\"John\");\n\nalert(allUsers.has(user)); // true\n\nuser = new Proxy(user, {});\n\n*!*\nalert(allUsers.has(user)); // false\n*/!*\n```\n\nAs we can see, after proxying we can't find `user` in the set `allUsers`, because the proxy is a different object.\n\n```warn header=\"Proxies can't intercept a strict equality test `===`\"\nProxies can intercept many operators, such as `new` (with `construct`), `in` (with `has`), `delete` (with `deleteProperty`) and so on.\n\nBut there's no way to intercept a strict equality test for objects. An object is strictly equal to itself only, and no other value.\n\nSo all operations and built-in classes that compare objects for equality will differentiate between the object and the proxy. No transparent replacement here.\n```\n\n## Revocable proxies\n\nA *revocable* proxy is a proxy that can be disabled.\n\nLet's say we have a resource, and would like to close access to it any moment.\n\nWhat we can do is to wrap it into a revocable proxy, without any traps. Such a proxy will forward operations to object, and we can disable it at any moment.\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\nlet {proxy, revoke} = Proxy.revocable(target, handler)\n```\n\nThe call returns an object with the `proxy` and `revoke` function to disable it.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```js run\nlet object = {\n  data: \"Valuable data\"\n};\n\nlet {proxy, revoke} = Proxy.revocable(object, {});\n\n// pass the proxy somewhere instead of object...\nalert(proxy.data); // Valuable data\n\n// later in our code\nrevoke();\n\n// the proxy isn't working any more (revoked)\nalert(proxy.data); // Error\n```\n\nA call to `revoke()` removes all internal references to the target object from the proxy, so they are no more connected. The target object can be garbage-collected after that.\n\nWe can also store `revoke` in a `WeakMap`, to be able to easily find it by a proxy object:\n\n```js run\n*!*\nlet revokes = new WeakMap();\n*/!*\n\nlet object = {\n  data: \"Valuable data\"\n};\n\nlet {proxy, revoke} = Proxy.revocable(object, {});\n\nrevokes.set(proxy, revoke);\n\n// ..later in our code..\nrevoke = revokes.get(proxy);\nrevoke();\n\nalert(proxy.data); // Error (revoked)\n```\n\nThe benefit of such an approach is that we don't have to carry `revoke` around. We can get it from the map by `proxy` when needed.\n\nWe use `WeakMap` instead of `Map` here because it won't block garbage collection. If a proxy object becomes \"unreachable\" (e.g. no variable references it any more), `WeakMap` allows it to be wiped from memory together with its `revoke` that we won't need any more.\n\n## References\n\n- Specification: [Proxy](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-proxy-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots).\n- MDN: [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy).\n\n## Summary\n\n`Proxy` is a wrapper around an object, that forwards operations on it to the object, optionally trapping some of them.\n\nIt can wrap any kind of object, including classes and functions.\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\nlet proxy = new Proxy(target, {\n  /* traps */\n});\n```\n\n...Then we should use `proxy` everywhere instead of `target`. A proxy doesn't have its own properties or methods. It traps an operation if the trap is provided, otherwise forwards it to `target` object.\n\nWe can trap:\n- Reading (`get`), writing (`set`), deleting (`deleteProperty`) a property (even a non-existing one).\n- Calling a function (`apply` trap).\n- The `new` operator (`construct` trap).\n- Many other operations (the full list is at the beginning of the article and in the [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)).\n\nThat allows us to create \"virtual\" properties and methods, implement default values, observable objects, function decorators and so much more.\n\nWe can also wrap an object multiple times in different proxies, decorating it with various aspects of functionality.\n\nThe [Reflect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect) API is designed to complement [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy). For any `Proxy` trap, there's a `Reflect` call with same arguments. We should use those to forward calls to target objects.\n\nProxies have some limitations:\n\n- Built-in objects have \"internal slots\", access to those can't be proxied. See the workaround above.\n- The same holds true for private class fields, as they are internally implemented using slots. So proxied method calls must have the target object as `this` to access them.\n- Object equality tests `===` can't be intercepted.\n- Performance: benchmarks depend on an engine, but generally accessing a property using a simplest proxy takes a few times longer. In practice that only matters for some \"bottleneck\" objects though.",

It's often said that \"eval is evil\".\n\nThe reason is simple: long, long time ago JavaScript was a much weaker language, many things could only be done with `eval`. But that time passed a decade ago.\n\nRight now, there's almost no reason to use `eval`. If someone is using it, there's a good chance they can replace it with a modern language construct or a [JavaScript Module](info:modules).\n\nPlease note that its ability to access outer variables has side-effects.\n\nCode minifiers (tools used before JS gets to production, to compress it) rename local variables into shorter ones (like `a`, `b` etc) to make the code smaller. That's usually safe, but not if `eval` is used, as local variables may be accessed from eval'ed code string. So minifiers don't do that renaming for all variables potentially visible from `eval`. That negatively affects code compression ratio.\n\nUsing outer local variables inside `eval` is also considered a bad programming practice, as it makes maintaining the code more difficult.\n\nThere are two ways how to be totally safe from such problems.\n\n**If eval'ed code doesn't use outer variables, please call `eval` as `window.eval(...)`:**\n\nThis way the code is executed in the global scope:\n\n```js untrusted refresh run\nlet x = 1;\n{\n  let x = 5;\n  window.eval('alert(x)'); // 1 (global variable)\n}\n```\n\n**If eval'ed code needs local variables, change `eval` to `new Function` and pass them as arguments:**\n\n```js run\nlet f = new Function('a', 'alert(a)');\n\nf(5); // 5\n```\n\nThe `new Function` construct is explained in the chapter <info:new-function>. It creates a function from a string, also in the global scope. So it can't see local variables. But it's so much clearer to pass them explicitly as arguments, like in the example above.\n\n## Summary\n\nA call to `eval(code)` runs the string of code and returns the result of the last statement.\n- Rarely used in modern JavaScript, as there's usually no need.\n- Can access outer local variables. That's considered bad practice.\n- Instead, to `eval` the code in the global scope, use `window.eval(code)`.\n- Or, if your code needs some data from the outer scope, use `new Function` and pass it as arguments.",

        "content": "\n\n[Currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) is an advanced technique of working with functions. It's used not only in JavaScript, but in other languages as well.\n\nCurrying is a transformation of functions that translates a function from callable as `f(a, b, c)` into callable as `f(a)(b)(c)`.\n\nCurrying doesn't call a function. It just transforms it.\n\nLet's see an example first, to better understand what we're talking about, and then practical applications.\n\nWe'll create a helper function `curry(f)` that performs currying for a two-argument `f`. In other words, `curry(f)` for two-argument `f(a, b)` translates it into a function that runs as `f(a)(b)`:\n\n```js run\n*!*\nfunction curry(f) { // curry(f) does the currying transform\n  return function(a) {\n    return function(b) {\n      return f(a, b);\n    };\n  };\n}\n*/!*\n\n// usage\nfunction sum(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nlet curriedSum = curry(sum);\n\nalert( curriedSum(1)(2) ); // 3\n```\n\nAs you can see, the implementation is straightforward: it's just two wrappers.\n\n- The result of `curry(func)` is a wrapper `function(a)`.\n- When it is called like `curriedSum(1)`, the argument is saved in the Lexical Environment, and a new wrapper is returned `function(b)`.\n- Then this wrapper is called with `2` as an argument, and it passes the call to the original `sum`.\n\nMore advanced implementations of currying, such as [_.curry](https://lodash.com/docs#curry) from lodash library, return a wrapper that allows a function to be called both normally and partially:\n\n```js run\nfunction sum(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nlet curriedSum = _.curry(sum); // using _.curry from lodash library\n\nalert( curriedSum(1, 2) ); // 3, still callable normally\nalert( curriedSum(1)(2) ); // 3, called partially\n```\n\n## Currying? What for?\n\nTo understand the benefits we need a worthy real-life example.\n\nFor instance, we have the logging function `log(date, importance, message)` that formats and outputs the information. In real projects such functions have many useful features like sending logs over the network, here we'll just use `alert`:\n\n```js\nfunction log(date, importance, message) {\n  alert(`[${date.getHours()}:${date.getMinutes()}] [${importance}] ${message}`);\n}\n```\n\nLet's curry it!\n\n```js\nlog = _.curry(log);\n```\n\nAfter that `log` works normally:\n\n```js\nlog(new Date(), \"DEBUG\", \"some debug\"); // log(a, b, c)\n```\n\n...But also works in the curried form:\n\n```js\nlog(new Date())(\"DEBUG\")(\"some debug\"); // log(a)(b)(c)\n```\n\nNow we can easily make a convenience function for current logs:\n\n```js\n// logNow will be the partial of log with fixed first argument\nlet logNow = log(new Date());\n\n// use it\nlogNow(\"INFO\", \"message\"); // [HH:mm] INFO message\n```\n\nNow `logNow` is `log` with fixed first argument, in other words \"partially applied function\" or \"partial\" for short.\n\nWe can go further and make a convenience function for current debug logs:\n\n```js\nlet debugNow = logNow(\"DEBUG\");\n\ndebugNow(\"message\"); // [HH:mm] DEBUG message\n```\n\nSo:\n1. We didn't lose anything after currying: `log` is still callable normally.\n2. We can easily generate partial functions such as for today's logs.\n\n## Advanced curry implementation\n\nIn case you'd like to get in to the details, here's the \"advanced\" curry implementation for multi-argument functions that we could use above.\n\nIt's pretty short:\n\n```js\nfunction curry(func) {\n\n  return function curried(...args) {\n    if (args.length >= func.length) {\n      return func.apply(this, args);\n    } else {\n      return function(...args2) {\n        return curried.apply(this, args.concat(args2));\n      }\n    }\n  };\n\n}\n```\n\nUsage examples:\n\n```js\nfunction sum(a, b, c) {\n  return a + b + c;\n}\n\nlet curriedSum = curry(sum);\n\nalert( curriedSum(1, 2, 3) ); // 6, still callable normally\nalert( curriedSum(1)(2,3) ); // 6, currying of 1st arg\nalert( curriedSum(1)(2)(3) ); // 6, full currying\n```\n\nThe new `curry` may look complicated, but it's actually easy to understand.\n\nThe result of `curry(func)` call is the wrapper `curried` that looks like this:\n\n```js\n// func is the function to transform\nfunction curried(...args) {\n  if (args.length >= func.length) { // (1)\n    return func.apply(this, args);\n  } else {\n    return function pass(...args2) { // (2)\n      return curried.apply(this, args.concat(args2));\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\nWhen we run it, there are two `if` execution branches:\n\n1. Call now: if passed `args` count is the same as the original function has in its definition (`func.length`) or longer, then just pass the call to it.\n2. Get a partial: otherwise, `func` is not called yet. Instead, another wrapper `pass` is returned, that will re-apply `curried` providing previous arguments together with the new ones. Then on a new call, again, we'll get either a new partial (if not enough arguments) or, finally, the result.\n\nFor instance, let's see what happens in the case of `sum(a, b, c)`. Three arguments, so `sum.length = 3`.\n\nFor the call `curried(1)(2)(3)`:\n\n1. The first call `curried(1)` remembers `1` in its Lexical Environment, and returns a wrapper `pass`.\n2. The wrapper `pass` is called with `(2)`: it takes previous args (`1`), concatenates them with what it got `(2)` and calls `curried(1, 2)` with them together. As the argument count is still less than 3, `curry` returns `pass`.\n3. The wrapper `pass` is called again with `(3)`,  for the next call `pass(3)` takes previous args (`1`, `2`) and adds `3` to them, making the call `curried(1, 2, 3)` -- there are `3` arguments at last, they are given to the original function.\n\nIf that's still not obvious, just trace the calls sequence in your mind or on paper.\n\n```smart header=\"Fixed-length functions only\"\nThe currying requires the function to have a fixed number of arguments.\n\nA function that uses rest parameters, such as `f(...args)`, can't be curried this way.\n```\n\n```smart header=\"A little more than currying\"\nBy definition, currying should convert `sum(a, b, c)` into `sum(a)(b)(c)`.\n\nBut most implementations of currying in JavaScript are advanced, as described: they also keep the function callable in the multi-argument variant.\n```\n\n## Summary\n\n*Currying* is a transform that makes `f(a,b,c)` callable as `f(a)(b)(c)`. JavaScript implementations usually both keep the function callable normally and return the partial if the arguments count is not enough.\n\nCurrying allows us to easily get partials. As we've seen in the logging example, after currying the three argument universal function `log(date, importance, message)` gives us partials when called with one argument (like `log(date)`) or two arguments (like `log(date, importance)`).",

Many experienced developers live fine without knowing it. Read on if you're  want to know how things work under the hood.\n```\n\nA dynamically evaluated method call can lose `this`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  hi() { alert(this.name); },\n  bye() { alert(\"Bye\"); }\n};\n\nuser.hi(); // works\n\n// now let's call user.hi or user.bye depending on the name\n*!*\n(user.name == \"John\" ? user.hi : user.bye)(); // Error!\n*/!*\n```\n\nOn the last line there is a conditional operator that chooses either `user.hi` or `user.bye`. In this case the result is `user.hi`.\n\nThen the method is immediately called with parentheses `()`. But it doesn't work correctly!\n\nAs you can see, the call results in an error, because the value of `\"this\"` inside the call becomes `undefined`.\n\nThis works (object dot method):\n```js\nuser.hi();\n```\n\nThis doesn't (evaluated method):\n```js\n(user.name == \"John\" ? user.hi : user.bye)(); // Error!\n```\n\nWhy? If we want to understand why it happens, let's get under the hood of how `obj.method()` call works.\n\n## Reference type explained\n\nLooking closely, we may notice two operations in `obj.method()` statement:\n\n1. First, the dot `'.'` retrieves the property `obj.method`.\n2. Then parentheses `()` execute it.\n\nSo, how does the information about `this` get passed from the first part to the second one?\n\nIf we put these operations on separate lines, then `this` will be lost for sure:\n\n```js run\nlet user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  hi() { alert(this.name); }\n}\n\n*!*\n// split getting and calling the method in two lines\nlet hi = user.hi;\nhi(); // Error, because this is undefined\n*/!*\n```\n\nHere `hi = user.hi` puts the function into the variable, and then on the last line it is completely standalone, and so there's no `this`.\n\n**To make `user.hi()` calls work, JavaScript uses a trick -- the dot `'.'` returns not a function, but a value of the special [Reference Type](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-reference-specification-type).**\n\nThe Reference Type is a \"specification type\". We can't explicitly use it, but it is used internally by the language.\n\nThe value of Reference Type is a three-value combination `(base, name, strict)`, where:\n\n- `base` is the object.\n- `name` is the property name.\n- `strict` is true if `use strict` is in effect.\n\nThe result of a property access `user.hi` is not a function, but a value of Reference Type. For `user.hi` in strict mode it is:\n\n```js\n// Reference Type value\n(user, \"hi\", true)\n```\n\nWhen parentheses `()` are called on the Reference Type, they receive the full information about the object and its method, and can set the right `this` (`=user` in this case).\n\nReference type is a special \"intermediary\" internal type, with the purpose to pass information from dot `.` to calling parentheses `()`.\n\nAny other operation like assignment `hi = user.hi` discards the reference type as a whole, takes the value of `user.hi` (a function) and passes it on. So any further operation \"loses\" `this`.\n\nSo, as the result, the value of `this` is only passed the right way if the function is called directly using a dot `obj.method()` or square brackets `obj['method']()` syntax (they do the same here). Later in this tutorial, we will learn various ways to solve this problem such as [func.bind()](/bind#solution-2-bind).\n\n## Summary\n\nReference Type is an internal type of the language.\n\nReading a property, such as with dot `.` in `obj.method()` returns not exactly the property value, but a special \"reference type\" value that stores both the property value and the object it was taken from.\n\nThat's for the subsequent method call `()` to get the object and set `this` to it.\n\nFor all other operations, the reference type automatically becomes the property value (a function in our case).\n\nThe whole mechanics is hidden from our eyes. It only matters in subtle cases, such as when a method is obtained dynamically from the object, using an expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n result of dot `.` isn't actually a method, but a value of `` needs a way to pass the information about `obj`",

All operations on bigints return bigints.\n\nWe can't mix bigints and regular numbers:\n\n```js run\nalert(1n + 2); // Error: Cannot mix BigInt and other types\n```\n\nWe should explicitly convert them if needed: using either `BigInt()` or `Number()`, like this:\n\n```js run\nlet bigint = 1n;\nlet number = 2;\n\n// number to bigint\nalert(bigint + BigInt(number)); // 3\n\n// bigint to number\nalert(Number(bigint) + number); // 3\n```\n\nThe conversion operations are always silent, never give errors, but if the bigint is too huge and won't fit the number type, then extra bits will be cut off, so we should be careful doing such conversion.\n\n````smart header=\"The unary plus is not supported on bigints\"\nThe unary plus operator `+value` is a well-known way to convert `value` to a number.\n\nOn bigints it's not supported, to avoid confusion:\n```js run\nlet bigint = 1n;\n\nalert( +bigint ); // error\n```\nSo we should use `Number()` to convert a bigint to a number.\n````\n\n## Comparisons\n\nComparisons, such as `<`, `>` work with bigints and numbers just fine:\n\n```js run\nalert( 2n > 1n ); // true\n\nalert( 2n > 1 ); // true\n```\n\nPlease note though, as numbers and bigints belong to different types, they can be equal `==`, but not strictly equal `===`:\n\n```js run\nalert( 1 == 1n ); // true\n\nalert( 1 === 1n ); // false\n```\n\n## Boolean operations\n\nWhen inside `if` or other boolean operations, bigints behave like numbers.\n\nFor instance, in `if`, bigint `0n` is falsy, other values are truthy:\n\n```js run\nif (0n) {\n  // never executes\n}\n```\n\nBoolean operators, such as `||`, `&&` and others also work with bigints similar to numbers:\n\n```js run\nalert( 1n || 2 ); // 1 (1n is considered truthy)\n\nalert( 0n || 2 ); // 2 (0n is considered falsy)\n```\n\n## Polyfills\n\nPolyfilling bigints is tricky. The reason is that many JavaScript operators, such as `+`, `-` and so on behave differently with bigints compared to regular numbers.\n\nFor example, division of bigints always returns a bigint (rounded if necessary).\n\nTo emulate such behavior, a polyfill would need to analyze the code and replace all such operators with its functions. But doing so is cumbersome and would cost a lot of performance.\n\nSo, there's no well-known good polyfill.\n\nAlthough, the other way around is proposed by the developers of [JSBI](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/jsbi) library.\n\nThis library implements big numbers using its own methods. We can use them instead of native bigints:\n\n| Operation | native `BigInt` | JSBI |\n|-----------|-----------------|------|\n| Creation from Number | `a = BigInt(789)` | `a = JSBI.BigInt(789)` |\n| Addition | `c = a + b` | `c = JSBI.add(a, b)` |\n| Subtraction\t| `c = a - b` | `c = JSBI.subtract(a, b)` |\n| ... | ... | ... |\n\n...And then use the polyfill (Babel plugin) to convert JSBI calls to native bigints for those browsers that support them.\n\nIn other words, this approach suggests that we write code in JSBI instead of native bigints. But JSBI works with numbers as with bigints internally, emulates them closely following the specification, so the code will be \"bigint-ready\".\n\nWe can use such JSBI code \"as is\" for engines that don't support bigints and for those that do support - the polyfill will convert the calls to native bigints.\n\n## References\n\n- [MDN docs on BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt).\n- [Specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-bigint-objects).",

        "content": "\n\nThe JavaScript language was initially created for web browsers. Since then it has evolved and become a language with many uses and platforms.\n\nA platform may be a browser, or a web-server or another *host*, even a coffee machine. Each of them provides platform-specific functionality. The JavaScript specification calls that a *host environment*.\n\nA host environment provides own objects and functions additional to the language core. Web browsers give a means to control web pages. Node.js provides server-side features, and so on.\n\nHere's a bird's-eye view of what we have when JavaScript runs in a web-browser:\n\n![](windowObjects.svg)\n\nThere's a \"root\" object called `window`. It has two roles:\n\n1. First, it is a global object for JavaScript code, as described in the chapter <info:global-object>.\n2. Second, it represents the \"browser window\" and provides methods to control it.\n\nFor instance, here we use it as a global object:\n\n```js run\nfunction sayHi() {\n  alert(\"Hello\");\n}\n\n// global functions are methods of the global object:\nwindow.sayHi();\n```\n\nAnd here we use it as a browser window, to see the window height:\n\n```js run\nalert(window.innerHeight); // inner window height\n```\n\nThere are more window-specific methods and properties, we'll cover them later.\n\n## DOM (Document Object Model)\n\nDocument Object Model, or DOM for short, represents all page content as objects that can be modified.\n\nThe `document` object is the main \"entry point\" to the page. We can change or create anything on the page using it.\n\nFor instance:\n```js run\n// change the background color to red\ndocument.body.style.background = \"red\";\n\n// change it back after 1 second\nsetTimeout(() => document.body.style.background = \"\", 1000);\n```\n\nHere we used `document.body.style`, but there's much, much more. Properties and methods are described in the specification:\n\n- **DOM Living Standard** at <https://dom.spec.whatwg.org>\n\n```smart header=\"DOM is not only for browsers\"\nThe DOM specification explains the structure of a document and provides objects to manipulate it. There are non-browser instruments that use DOM too.\n\nFor instance, server-side scripts that download HTML pages and process them can also use DOM. They may support only a part of the specification though.\n```\n\n```smart header=\"CSSOM for styling\"\nCSS rules and stylesheets are structured in a different way than HTML. There's a separate specification, [CSS Object Model (CSSOM)](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/), that explains how they are represented as objects, and how to read and write them.\n\nCSSOM is used together with DOM when we modify style rules for the document. In practice though, CSSOM is rarely required, because usually CSS rules are static. We rarely need to add/remove CSS rules from JavaScript, but that's also possible.\n```\n\n## BOM (Browser Object Model)\n\nThe Browser Object Model (BOM) represents additional objects provided by the browser (host environment) for working with everything except the document.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- The [navigator](mdn:api/Window/navigator) object provides background information about the browser and the operating system. There are many properties, but the two most widely known are: `navigator.userAgent` -- about the current browser, and `navigator.platform` -- about the platform (can help to differ between Windows/Linux/Mac etc).\n- The [location](mdn:api/Window/location) object allows us to read the current URL and can redirect the browser to a new one.\n\nHere's how we can use the `location` object:\n\n```js run\nalert(location.href); // shows current URL\nif (confirm(\"Go to Wikipedia?\")) {\n  location.href = \"https://wikipedia.org\"; // redirect the browser to another URL\n}\n```\n\nFunctions `alert/confirm/prompt` are also a part of BOM: they are directly not related to the document, but represent pure browser methods of communicating with the user.\n\n```smart header=\"Specifications\"\nBOM is the part of the general [HTML specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org).\n\nYes, you heard that right. The HTML spec at <https://html.spec.whatwg.org> is not only about the \"HTML language\" (tags, attributes), but also covers a bunch of objects, methods and browser-specific DOM extensions. That's \"HTML in broad terms\". Also, some parts have additional specs listed at <https://spec.whatwg.org>.\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nTalking about standards, we have:\n\nDOM specification\n: Describes the document structure, manipulations and events, see <https://dom.spec.whatwg.org>.\n\nCSSOM specification\n: Describes stylesheets and style rules, manipulations with them and their binding to documents, see <https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/>.\n\nHTML specification\n: Describes the HTML language (e.g. tags) and also the BOM (browser object model) -- various browser functions: `setTimeout`, `alert`, `location` and so on, see <https://html.spec.whatwg.org>. It takes the DOM specification and extends it with many additional properties and methods.\n\nAdditionally, some classes are described separately at <https://spec.whatwg.org/>.\n\nPlease note these links, as there's so much stuff to learn it's impossible to cover and remember everything.\n\nWhen you'd like to read about a property or a method, the Mozilla manual at <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search> is also a nice resource, but the corresponding spec may be better: it's more complex and longer to read, but will make your fundamental knowledge sound and complete.\n\nTo find something, it's often convenient to use an internet search \"WHATWG [term]\" or \"MDN [term]\", e.g <https://google.com?q=whatwg+localstorage>, <https://google.com?q=mdn+localstorage>.\n\nNow we'll get down to learning DOM, because the document plays the central role in the UI.",

The text inside a tag is an object as well.\n\nAll these objects are accessible using JavaScript, and we can use them to modify the page.\n\nFor example, `document.body` is the object representing the `<body>` tag.\n\nRunning this code will make the `<body>` red for 3 seconds:\n\n```js run\ndocument.body.style.background = 'red'; // make the background red\n\nsetTimeout(() => document.body.style.background = '', 3000); // return back\n```\n\nHere we used `style.background` to change the background color of `document.body`, but there are many other properties, such as:\n\n- `innerHTML` -- HTML contents of the node.\n- `offsetWidth` -- the node width (in pixels)\n- ...and so on.\n\nSoon we'll learn more ways to manipulate the DOM, but first we need to know about its structure.\n\n## An example of the DOM\n\nLet's start with the following simple document:\n\n```html run no-beautify\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>About elk</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  The truth about elk.\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe DOM represents HTML as a tree structure of tags. Here's how it looks:\n\n<div class=\"domtree\"></div>\n\n<script>\nlet node1 = {\"name\":\"HTML\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"HEAD\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"\\n    \"},{\"name\":\"TITLE\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"About elk\"}]},{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"\\n  \"}]},{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"\\n  \"},{\"name\":\"BODY\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"\\n  The truth about elk.\"}]}]}\n\ndrawHtmlTree(node1, 'div.domtree', 690, 320);\n</script>\n\n```online\nOn the picture above, you can click on element nodes and their children will open/collapse.\n```\n\nEvery tree node is an object.\n\nTags are *element nodes* (or just elements) and form the tree structure: `<html>` is at the root, then `<head>` and `<body>` are its children, etc.\n\nThe text inside elements forms *text nodes*, labelled as `#text`. A text node contains only a string. It may not have children and is always a leaf of the tree.\n\nFor instance, the `<title>` tag has the text `\"About elk\"`.\n\nPlease note the special characters in text nodes:\n\n- a newline: `↵` (in JavaScript known as `\\n`)\n- a space: `␣`\n\nSpaces and newlines are totally valid characters, like letters and digits. They form text nodes and become a part of the DOM. So, for instance, in the example above the `<head>` tag contains some spaces before `<title>`, and that text becomes a `#text` node (it contains a newline and some spaces only).\n\nThere are only two top-level exclusions:\n1. Spaces and newlines before `<head>` are ignored for historical reasons.\n2. If we put something after `</body>`, then that is automatically moved inside the `body`, at the end, as the HTML spec requires that all content must be inside `<body>`. So there can't be any spaces after `</body>`.\n\nIn other cases everything's straightforward -- if there are spaces (just like any character) in the document, then they become text nodes in the DOM, and if we remove them, then there won't be any.\n\nHere are no space-only text nodes:\n\n```html no-beautify\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html><head><title>About elk</title></head><body>The truth about elk.</body></html>\n```\n\n<div class=\"domtree\"></div>\n\n<script>\nlet node2 = {\"name\":\"HTML\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"HEAD\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"TITLE\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"About elk\"}]}]},{\"name\":\"BODY\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"The truth about elk.\"}]}]}\n\ndrawHtmlTree(node2, 'div.domtree', 690, 210);\n</script>\n\n```smart header=\"Spaces at string start/end and space-only text nodes are usually hidden in tools\"\nBrowser tools (to be covered soon) that work with DOM usually do not show spaces at the start/end of the text and empty text nodes (line-breaks) between tags.\n\nDeveloper tools save screen space this way.\n\nOn further DOM pictures we'll sometimes omit them when they are irrelevant. Such spaces usually do not affect how the document is displayed.\n```\n\n## Autocorrection\n\nIf the browser encounters malformed HTML, it automatically corrects it when making the DOM.\n\nFor instance, the top tag is always `<html>`. Even if it doesn't exist in the document, it will exist in the DOM, because the browser will create it. The same goes for `<body>`.\n\nAs an example, if the HTML file is the single word `\"Hello\"`, the browser will wrap it into `<html>` and `<body>`, and add the required `<head>`, and the DOM will be:\n\n\n<div class=\"domtree\"></div>\n\n<script>\nlet node3 = {\"name\":\"HTML\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"HEAD\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[]},{\"name\":\"BODY\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"Hello\"}]}]}\n\ndrawHtmlTree(node3, 'div.domtree', 690, 150);\n</script>\n\nWhile generating the DOM, browsers automatically process errors in the document, close tags and so on.\n\nA document with unclosed tags:\n\n```html no-beautify\n<p>Hello\n<li>Mom\n<li>and\n<li>Dad\n```\n\n...will become a normal DOM as the browser reads tags and restores the missing parts:\n\n<div class=\"domtree\"></div>\n\n<script>\nlet node4 = {\"name\":\"HTML\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"HEAD\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[]},{\"name\":\"BODY\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"P\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"Hello\"}]},{\"name\":\"LI\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"Mom\"}]},{\"name\":\"LI\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"and\"}]},{\"name\":\"LI\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"Dad\"}]}]}]}\n\ndrawHtmlTree(node4, 'div.domtree', 690, 360);\n</script>\n\n````warn header=\"Tables always have `<tbody>`\"\nAn interesting \"special case\" is tables. By the DOM specification they must have `<tbody>`, but HTML text may (officially) omit it. Then the browser creates `<tbody>` in the DOM automatically.\n\nFor the HTML:\n\n```html no-beautify\n<table id=\"table\"><tr><td>1</td></tr></table>\n```\n\nDOM-structure will be:\n<div class=\"domtree\"></div>\n\n<script>\nlet node5 = {\"name\":\"TABLE\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"TBODY\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"TR\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"TD\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"1\"}]}]}]}]};\n\ndrawHtmlTree(node5,  'div.domtree', 600, 200);\n</script>\n\nYou see? The `<tbody>` appeared out of nowhere. You should keep this in mind while working with tables to avoid surprises.\n````\n\n## Other node types\n\nThere are some other node types besides elements and text nodes.\n\nFor example, comments:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html>\n<body>\n  The truth about elk.\n  <ol>\n    <li>An elk is a smart</li>\n*!*\n    <!-- comment -->\n*/!*\n    <li>...and cunning animal!</li>\n  </ol>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n<div class=\"domtree\"></div>\n\n<script>\nlet node6 = {\"name\":\"HTML\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"HEAD\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[]},{\"name\":\"BODY\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"\\n  The truth about elk.\\n    \"},{\"name\":\"OL\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"\\n      \"},{\"name\":\"LI\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"An elk is a smart\"}]},{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"\\n      \"},{\"name\":\"#comment\",\"nodeType\":8,\"content\":\"comment\"},{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"\\n      \"},{\"name\":\"LI\",\"nodeType\":1,\"children\":[{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"...and cunning animal!\"}]},{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"\\n    \"}]},{\"name\":\"#text\",\"nodeType\":3,\"content\":\"\\n  \\n\"}]}]};\n\ndrawHtmlTree(node6, 'div.domtree', 690, 500);\n</script>\n\nWe can see here a new tree node type -- *comment node*, labeled as `#comment`, between two text nodes.\n\nWe may think -- why is a comment added to the DOM? It doesn't affect the visual representation in any way. But there's a rule -- if something's in HTML, then it also must be in the DOM tree.\n\n**Everything in HTML, even comments, becomes a part of the DOM.**\n\nEven the `<!DOCTYPE...>` directive at the very beginning of HTML is also a DOM node. It's in the DOM tree right before `<html>`. We are not going to touch that node, we even don't draw it on diagrams for that reason, but it's there.\n\nThe `document` object that represents the whole document is, formally, a DOM node as well.\n\nThere are [12 node types](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#node). In practice we usually work with 4 of them:\n\n1. `document` -- the \"entry point\" into DOM.\n2. element nodes -- HTML-tags, the tree building blocks.\n3. text nodes -- contain text.\n4. comments -- sometimes we can put information there, it won't be shown, but JS can read it from the DOM.\n\n## See it for yourself\n\nTo see the DOM structure in real-time, try [Live DOM Viewer](http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/). Just type in the document, and it will show up as a DOM at an instant.\n\nAnother way to explore the DOM is to use the browser developer tools. Actually, that's what we use when developing.\n\nTo do so, open the web page [elk.html](elk.html), turn on the browser developer tools and switch to the Elements tab.\n\nIt should look like this:\n\n![](elk.svg)\n\nYou can see the DOM, click on elements, see their details and so on.\n\nPlease note that the DOM structure in developer tools is simplified. Text nodes are shown just as text. And there are no \"blank\" (space only) text nodes at all. That's fine, because most of the time we are interested in element nodes.\n\nClicking the <span class=\"devtools\" style=\"background-position:-328px -124px\"></span> button in the left-upper corner allows us to choose a node from the webpage using a mouse (or other pointer devices) and \"inspect\" it (scroll to it in the Elements tab). This works great when we have a huge HTML page (and corresponding huge DOM) and would like to see the place of a particular element in it.\n\nAnother way to do it would be just right-clicking on a webpage and selecting \"Inspect\" in the context menu.\n\n![](inspect.svg)\n\nAt the right part of the tools there are the following subtabs:\n- **Styles** -- we can see CSS applied to the current element rule by rule, including built-in rules (gray). Almost everything can be edited in-place, including the dimensions/margins/paddings of the box below.\n- **Computed** -- to see CSS applied to the element by property: for each property we can see a rule that gives it (including CSS inheritance and such).\n- **Event Listeners** -- to see event listeners attached to DOM elements (we'll cover them in the next part of the tutorial).\n- ...and so on.\n\nThe best way to study them is to click around. Most values are editable in-place.\n\n## Interaction with console\n\nAs we work the DOM, we also may want to apply JavaScript to it. Like: get a node and run some code to modify it, to see the result. Here are few tips to travel between the Elements tab and the console.\n\nFor the start:\n\n1. Select the first `<li>` in the Elements tab.\n2. Press `key:Esc` -- it will open console right below the Elements tab.\n\nNow the last selected element is available as `$0`, the previously selected is `$1` etc.\n\nWe can run commands on them. For instance, `$0.style.background = 'red'` makes the selected list item red, like this:\n\n![](domconsole0.svg)\n\nThat's how to get a node from Elements in Console.\n\nThere's also a road back. If there's a variable referencing a DOM node, then we can use the command `inspect(node)` in Console to see it in the Elements pane.\n\nOr we can just output the DOM node in the console and explore \"in-place\", like `document.body` below:\n\n![](domconsole1.svg)\n\nThat's for debugging purposes of course. From the next chapter on we'll access and modify DOM using JavaScript.\n\nThe browser developer tools are a great help in development: we can explore the DOM, try things and see what goes wrong.\n\n## Summary\n\nAn HTML/XML document is represented inside the browser as the DOM tree.\n\n- Tags become element nodes and form the structure.\n- Text becomes text nodes.\n- ...etc, everything in HTML has its place in DOM, even comments.\n\nWe can use developer tools to inspect DOM and modify it manually.\n\nHere we covered the basics, the most used and important actions to start with. There's an extensive documentation about Chrome Developer Tools at <https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools>. The best way to learn the tools is to click here and there, read menus: most options are obvious. Later, when you know them in general, read the docs and pick up the rest.\n\nDOM nodes have properties and methods that allow us to travel between them, modify them, move around the page, and more. We'll get down to them in the next chapters.",

        "content": "\n\nThe DOM allows us to do anything with elements and their contents, but first we need to reach the corresponding DOM object.\n\nAll operations on the DOM start with the `document` object. That's the main \"entry point\" to DOM. From it we can access any node.\n\nHere's a picture of links that allow for travel between DOM nodes:\n\n![](dom-links.svg)\n\nLet's discuss them in more detail.\n\n## On top: documentElement and body\n\nThe topmost tree nodes are available directly as `document` properties:\n\n`<html>` = `document.documentElement`\n: The topmost document node is `document.documentElement`. That's the DOM node of the `<html>` tag.\n\n`<body>` = `document.body`\n: Another widely used DOM node is the `<body>` element -- `document.body`.\n\n`<head>` = `document.head`\n: The `<head>` tag is available as `document.head`.\n\n````warn header=\"There's a catch: `document.body` can be `null`\"\nA script cannot access an element that doesn't exist at the moment of running.\n\nIn particular, if a script is inside `<head>`, then `document.body` is unavailable, because the browser did not read it yet.\n\nSo, in the example below the first `alert` shows `null`:\n\n```html run\n<html>\n\n<head>\n  <script>\n*!*\n    alert( \"From HEAD: \" + document.body ); // null, there's no <body> yet\n*/!*\n  </script>\n</head>\n\n<body>\n\n  <script>\n    alert( \"From BODY: \" + document.body ); // HTMLBodyElement, now it exists\n  </script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n````\n\n```smart header=\"In the DOM world `null` means \\\"doesn't exist\\\"\"\nIn the DOM, the `null` value means \"doesn't exist\" or \"no such node\".\n```\n\n## Children: childNodes, firstChild, lastChild\n\nThere are two terms that we'll use from now on:\n\n- **Child nodes (or children)** -- elements that are direct children. In other words, they are nested exactly in the given one. For instance, `<head>` and `<body>` are children of `<html>` element.\n- **Descendants** -- all elements that are nested in the given one, including children, their children and so on.\n\nFor instance, here `<body>` has children `<div>` and `<ul>` (and few blank text nodes):\n\n```html run\n<html>\n<body>\n  <div>Begin</div>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <b>Information</b>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n...And descendants of `<body>` are not only direct children `<div>`, `<ul>` but also more deeply nested elements, such as `<li>` (a child of `<ul>`) and `<b>` (a child of `<li>`) -- the entire subtree.\n\n**The `childNodes` collection lists all child nodes, including text nodes.**\n\nThe example below shows children of `document.body`:\n\n```html run\n<html>\n<body>\n  <div>Begin</div>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>Information</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <div>End</div>\n\n  <script>\n*!*\n    for (let i = 0; i < document.body.childNodes.length; i++) {\n      alert( document.body.childNodes[i] ); // Text, DIV, Text, UL, ..., SCRIPT\n    }\n*/!*\n  </script>\n  ...more stuff...\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nPlease note an interesting detail here. If we run the example above, the last element shown is `<script>`. In fact, the document has more stuff below, but at the moment of the script execution the browser did not read it yet, so the script doesn't see it.\n\n**Properties `firstChild` and `lastChild` give fast access to the first and last children.**\n\nThey are just shorthands. If there exist child nodes, then the following is always true:\n```js\nelem.childNodes[0] === elem.firstChild\nelem.childNodes[elem.childNodes.length - 1] === elem.lastChild\n```\n\nThere's also a special function `elem.hasChildNodes()` to check whether there are any child nodes.\n\n### DOM collections\n\nAs we can see, `childNodes` looks like an array. But actually it's not an array, but rather a *collection* -- a special array-like iterable object.\n\nThere are two important consequences:\n\n1. We can use `for..of` to iterate over it:\n  ```js\n  for (let node of document.body.childNodes) {\n    alert(node); // shows all nodes from the collection\n  }\n  ```\n  That's because it's iterable (provides the `Symbol.iterator` property, as required).\n\n2. Array methods won't work, because it's not an array:\n  ```js run\n  alert(document.body.childNodes.filter); // undefined (there's no filter method!)\n  ```\n\nThe first thing is nice. The second is tolerable, because we can use `Array.from` to create a \"real\" array from the collection, if we want array methods:\n\n  ```js run\n  alert( Array.from(document.body.childNodes).filter ); // function\n  ```\n\n```warn header=\"DOM collections are read-only\"\nDOM collections, and even more -- *all* navigation properties listed in this chapter are read-only.\n\nWe can't replace a child by something else by assigning `childNodes[i] = ...`.\n\nChanging DOM needs other methods. We will see them in the next chapter.\n```\n\n```warn header=\"DOM collections are live\"\nAlmost all DOM collections with minor exceptions are *live*. In other words, they reflect the current state of DOM.\n\nIf we keep a reference to `elem.childNodes`, and add/remove nodes into DOM, then they appear in the collection automatically.\n```\n\n````warn header=\"Don't use `for..in` to loop over collections\"\nCollections are iterable using `for..of`. Sometimes people try to use `for..in` for that.\n\nPlease, don't. The `for..in` loop iterates over all enumerable properties. And collections have some \"extra\" rarely used properties that we usually do not want to get:\n\n```html run\n<body>\n<script>\n  // shows 0, 1, length, item, values and more.\n  for (let prop in document.body.childNodes) alert(prop);\n</script>\n</body>\n````\n\n## Siblings and the parent\n\n*Siblings* are nodes that are children of the same parent.\n\nFor instance, here `<head>` and `<body>` are siblings:\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <head>...</head><body>...</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n- `<body>` is said to be the \"next\" or \"right\" sibling of `<head>`,\n- `<head>` is said to be the \"previous\" or \"left\" sibling of `<body>`.\n\nThe next sibling is in `nextSibling` property, and the previous one - in `previousSibling`.\n\nThe parent is available as `parentNode`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\n// parent of <body> is <html>\nalert( document.body.parentNode === document.documentElement ); // true\n\n// after <head> goes <body>\nalert( document.head.nextSibling ); // HTMLBodyElement\n\n// before <body> goes <head>\nalert( document.body.previousSibling ); // HTMLHeadElement\n```\n\n## Element-only navigation\n\nNavigation properties listed above refer to *all* nodes. For instance, in `childNodes` we can see both text nodes, element nodes, and even comment nodes if there exist.\n\nBut for many tasks we don't want text or comment nodes. We want to manipulate element nodes that represent tags and form the structure of the page.\n\nSo let's see more navigation links that only take *element nodes* into account:\n\n![](dom-links-elements.svg)\n\nThe links are similar to those given above, just with `Element` word inside:\n\n- `children` -- only those children that are element nodes.\n- `firstElementChild`, `lastElementChild` -- first and last element children.\n- `previousElementSibling`, `nextElementSibling` -- neighbor elements.\n- `parentElement` -- parent element.\n\n````smart header=\"Why `parentElement`? Can the parent be *not* an element?\"\nThe `parentElement` property returns the \"element\" parent, while `parentNode` returns \"any node\" parent. These properties are usually the same: they both get the parent.\n\nWith the one exception of `document.documentElement`:\n\n```js run\nalert( document.documentElement.parentNode ); // document\nalert( document.documentElement.parentElement ); // null\n```\n\nThe reason is that the root node `document.documentElement` (`<html>`) has `document` as its parent. But `document` is not an element node, so `parentNode` returns it and `parentElement` does not.\n\nThis detail may be useful when we want to travel up from an arbitrary element `elem` to `<html>`, but not to the `document`:\n```js\nwhile(elem = elem.parentElement) { // go up till <html>\n  alert( elem );\n}\n```\n````\n\nLet's modify one of the examples above: replace `childNodes` with `children`. Now it shows only elements:\n\n```html run\n<html>\n<body>\n  <div>Begin</div>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>Information</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <div>End</div>\n\n  <script>\n*!*\n    for (let elem of document.body.children) {\n      alert(elem); // DIV, UL, DIV, SCRIPT\n    }\n*/!*\n  </script>\n  ...\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## More links: tables [#dom-navigation-tables]\n\nTill now we described the basic navigation properties.\n\nCertain types of DOM elements may provide additional properties, specific to their type, for convenience.\n\nTables are a great example of that, and represent a particularly important case:\n\n**The `<table>`** element supports (in addition to the given above) these properties:\n- `table.rows` -- the collection of `<tr>` elements of the table.\n- `table.caption/tHead/tFoot` -- references to elements `<caption>`, `<thead>`, `<tfoot>`.\n- `table.tBodies` -- the collection of `<tbody>` elements (can be many according to the standard, but there will always be at least one -- even if it is not in the source HTML, the browser will put it in the DOM).\n\n**`<thead>`, `<tfoot>`, `<tbody>`** elements provide the `rows` property:\n- `tbody.rows` -- the collection of `<tr>` inside.\n\n**`<tr>`:**\n- `tr.cells` -- the collection of `<td>` and `<th>` cells inside the given `<tr>`.\n- `tr.sectionRowIndex` -- the position (index) of the given `<tr>` inside the enclosing `<thead>/<tbody>/<tfoot>`.\n- `tr.rowIndex` -- the number of the `<tr>` in the table as a whole (including all table rows).\n\n**`<td>` and `<th>`:**\n- `td.cellIndex` -- the number of the cell inside the enclosing `<tr>`.\n\nAn example of usage:\n\n```html run height=100\n<table id=\"table\">\n  <tr>\n    <td>one</td><td>two</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>three</td><td>four</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<script>\n  // get td with \"two\" (first row, second column)\n  let td = table.*!*rows[0].cells[1]*/!*;\n  td.style.backgroundColor = \"red\"; // highlight it\n</script>\n```\n\nThe specification: [tabular data](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/tables.html).\n\nThere are also additional navigation properties for HTML forms. We'll look at them later when we start working with forms.\n\n## Summary\n\nGiven a DOM node, we can go to its immediate neighbors using navigation properties.\n\nThere are two main sets of them:\n\n- For all nodes: `parentNode`, `childNodes`, `firstChild`, `lastChild`, `previousSibling`, `nextSibling`.\n- For element nodes only: `parentElement`, `children`, `firstElementChild`, `lastElementChild`, `previousElementSibling`, `nextElementSibling`.\n\nSome types of DOM elements, e.g. tables, provide additional properties and collections to access their content.",

        "content": "\n\nDOM navigation properties are great when elements are close to each other. What if they are not? How to get an arbitrary element of the page?\n\nThere are additional searching methods for that.\n\n## document.getElementById or just id\n\nIf an element has the `id` attribute, we can get the element using the method `document.getElementById(id)`, no matter where it is.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run\n<div id=\"elem\">\n  <div id=\"elem-content\">Element</div>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n  // get the element\n*!*\n  let elem = document.getElementById('elem');\n*/!*\n\n  // make its background red\n  elem.style.background = 'red';\n</script>\n```\n\nAlso, there's a global variable named by `id` that references the element:\n\n```html run\n<div id=\"*!*elem*/!*\">\n  <div id=\"*!*elem-content*/!*\">Element</div>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n  // elem is a reference to DOM-element with id=\"elem\"\n  elem.style.background = 'red';\n\n  // id=\"elem-content\" has a hyphen inside, so it can't be a variable name\n  // ...but we can access it using square brackets: window['elem-content']\n</script>\n```\n\n...That's unless we declare a JavaScript variable with the same name, then it takes precedence:\n\n```html run untrusted height=0\n<div id=\"elem\"></div>\n\n<script>\n  let elem = 5; // now elem is 5, not a reference to <div id=\"elem\">\n\n  alert(elem); // 5\n</script>\n```\n\n```warn header=\"Please don't use id-named global variables to access elements\"\nThis behavior is described [in the specification](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#dom-window-nameditem), so it's kind of standard. But it is supported mainly for compatibility.\n\nThe browser tries to help us by mixing namespaces of JS and DOM. That's fine for simple scripts, inlined into HTML, but generally isn't a good thing. There may be naming conflicts. Also, when one reads JS code and doesn't have HTML in view, it's not obvious where the variable comes from.\n\nHere in the tutorial we use `id` to directly reference an element for brevity, when it's obvious where the element comes from.\n\nIn real life `document.getElementById` is the preferred method.\n```\n\n```smart header=\"The `id` must be unique\"\nThe `id` must be unique. There can be only one element in the document with the given `id`.\n\nIf there are multiple elements with the same `id`, then the behavior of methods that use it is unpredictable, e.g. `document.getElementById` may return any of such elements at random. So please stick to the rule and keep `id` unique.\n```\n\n```warn header=\"Only `document.getElementById`, not `anyElem.getElementById`\"\nThe method `getElementById` that can be called only on `document` object. It looks for the given `id` in the whole document.\n```\n\n## querySelectorAll [#querySelectorAll]\n\nBy far, the most versatile method, `elem.querySelectorAll(css)` returns all elements inside `elem` matching the given CSS selector.\n\nHere we look for all `<li>` elements that are last children:\n\n```html run\n<ul>\n  <li>The</li>\n  <li>test</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n  <li>has</li>\n  <li>passed</li>\n</ul>\n<script>\n*!*\n  let elements = document.querySelectorAll('ul > li:last-child');\n*/!*\n\n  for (let elem of elements) {\n    alert(elem.innerHTML); // \"test\", \"passed\"\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\nThis method is indeed powerful, because any CSS selector can be used.\n\n```smart header=\"Can use pseudo-classes as well\"\nPseudo-classes in the CSS selector like `:hover` and `:active` are also supported. For instance, `document.querySelectorAll(':hover')` will return the collection with elements that the pointer is over now (in nesting order: from the outermost `<html>` to the most nested one).\n```\n\n## querySelector [#querySelector]\n\nThe call to `elem.querySelector(css)` returns the first element for the given CSS selector.\n\nIn other words, the result is the same as `elem.querySelectorAll(css)[0]`, but the latter is looking for *all* elements and picking one, while `elem.querySelector` just looks for one. So it's faster and also shorter to write.\n\n## matches\n\nPrevious methods were searching the DOM.\n\nThe [elem.matches(css)](http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-element-matches) does not look for anything, it merely checks if `elem` matches the given CSS-selector. It returns `true` or `false`.\n\nThe method comes in handy when we are iterating over elements (like in an array or something) and trying to filter out those that interest us.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run\n<a href=\"http://example.com/file.zip\">...</a>\n<a href=\"http://ya.ru\">...</a>\n\n<script>\n  // can be any collection instead of document.body.children\n  for (let elem of document.body.children) {\n*!*\n    if (elem.matches('a[href$=\"zip\"]')) {\n*/!*\n      alert(\"The archive reference: \" + elem.href );\n    }\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\n## closest\n\n*Ancestors* of an element are: parent, the parent of parent, its parent and so on. The ancestors together form the chain of parents from the element to the top.\n\nThe method `elem.closest(css)` looks the nearest ancestor that matches the CSS-selector. The `elem` itself is also included in the search.\n\nIn other words, the method `closest` goes up from the element and checks each of parents. If it matches the selector, then the search stops, and the ancestor is returned.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run\n<h1>Contents</h1>\n\n<div class=\"contents\">\n  <ul class=\"book\">\n    <li class=\"chapter\">Chapter 1</li>\n    <li class=\"chapter\">Chapter 1</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n  let chapter = document.querySelector('.chapter'); // LI\n\n  alert(chapter.closest('.book')); // UL\n  alert(chapter.closest('.contents')); // DIV\n\n  alert(chapter.closest('h1')); // null (because h1 is not an ancestor)\n</script>\n```\n\n## getElementsBy*\n\nThere are also other methods to look for nodes by a tag, class, etc.\n\nToday, they are mostly history, as `querySelector` is more powerful and shorter to write.\n\nSo here we cover them mainly for completeness, while you can still find them in the old scripts.\n\n- `elem.getElementsByTagName(tag)` looks for elements with the given tag and returns the collection of them. The `tag` parameter can also be a star `\"*\"` for \"any tags\".\n- `elem.getElementsByClassName(className)` returns elements that have the given CSS class.\n- `document.getElementsByName(name)` returns elements with the given `name` attribute, document-wide. Very rarely used.\n\nFor instance:\n```js\n// get all divs in the document\nlet divs = document.getElementsByTagName('div');\n```\n\nLet's find all `input` tags inside the table:\n\n```html run height=50\n<table id=\"table\">\n  <tr>\n    <td>Your age:</td>\n\n    <td>\n      <label>\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"age\" value=\"young\" checked> less than 18\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"age\" value=\"mature\"> from 18 to 50\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"age\" value=\"senior\"> more than 60\n      </label>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<script>\n*!*\n  let inputs = table.getElementsByTagName('input');\n*/!*\n\n  for (let input of inputs) {\n    alert( input.value + ': ' + input.checked );\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\n```warn header=\"Don't forget the `\\\"s\\\"` letter!\"\nNovice developers sometimes forget the letter `\"s\"`. That is, they try to call `getElementByTagName` instead of <code>getElement<b>s</b>ByTagName</code>.\n\nThe `\"s\"` letter is absent in `getElementById`, because it returns a single element. But `getElementsByTagName` returns a collection of elements, so there's `\"s\"` inside.\n```\n\n````warn header=\"It returns a collection, not an element!\"\nAnother widespread novice mistake is to write:\n\n```js\n// doesn't work\ndocument.getElementsByTagName('input').value = 5;\n```\n\nThat won't work, because it takes a *collection* of inputs and assigns the value to it rather than to elements inside it.\n\nWe should either iterate over the collection or get an element by its index, and then assign, like this:\n\n```js\n// should work (if there's an input)\ndocument.getElementsByTagName('input')[0].value = 5;\n```\n````\n\nLooking for `.article` elements:\n\n```html run height=50\n<form name=\"my-form\">\n  <div class=\"article\">Article</div>\n  <div class=\"long article\">Long article</div>\n</form>\n\n<script>\n  // find by name attribute\n  let form = document.getElementsByName('my-form')[0];\n\n  // find by class inside the form\n  let articles = form.getElementsByClassName('article');\n  alert(articles.length); // 2, found two elements with class \"article\"\n</script>\n```\n\n## Live collections\n\nAll methods `\"getElementsBy*\"` return a *live* collection. Such collections always reflect the current state of the document and \"auto-update\" when it changes.\n\nIn the example below, there are two scripts.\n\n1. The first one creates a reference to the collection of `<div>`. As of now, its length is `1`.\n2. The second scripts runs after the browser meets one more `<div>`, so its length is `2`.\n\n```html run\n<div>First div</div>\n\n<script>\n  let divs = document.getElementsByTagName('div');\n  alert(divs.length); // 1\n</script>\n\n<div>Second div</div>\n\n<script>\n*!*\n  alert(divs.length); // 2\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\nIn contrast, `querySelectorAll` returns a *static* collection. It's like a fixed array of elements.\n\nIf we use it instead, then both scripts output `1`:\n\n\n```html run\n<div>First div</div>\n\n<script>\n  let divs = document.querySelectorAll('div');\n  alert(divs.length); // 1\n</script>\n\n<div>Second div</div>\n\n<script>\n*!*\n  alert(divs.length); // 1\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\nNow we can easily see the difference. The static collection did not increase after the appearance of a new `div` in the document.\n\n## Summary\n\nThere are 6 main methods to search for nodes in DOM:\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Method</td>\n<td>Searches by...</td>\n<td>Can call on an element?</td>\n<td>Live?</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>querySelector</code></td>\n<td>CSS-selector</td>\n<td>✔</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>querySelectorAll</code></td>\n<td>CSS-selector</td>\n<td>✔</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>getElementById</code></td>\n<td><code>id</code></td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>getElementsByName</code></td>\n<td><code>name</code></td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>✔</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>getElementsByTagName</code></td>\n<td>tag or <code>'*'</code></td>\n<td>✔</td>\n<td>✔</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>getElementsByClassName</code></td>\n<td>class</td>\n<td>✔</td>\n<td>✔</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nBy far the most used are `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll`, but `getElementBy*` can be sporadically helpful or found in the old scripts.\n\nBesides that:\n\n- There is `elem.matches(css)` to check if `elem` matches the given CSS selector.\n- There is `elem.closest(css)` to look for the nearest ancestor that matches the given CSS-selector. The `elem` itself is also checked.\n\nAnd let's mention one more method here to check for the child-parent relationship, as it's sometimes useful:\n-  `elemA.contains(elemB)` returns true if `elemB` is inside `elemA` (a descendant of `elemA`) or when `elemA==elemB`.",

        "content": "\n\nLet's get a more in-depth look at DOM nodes.\n\nIn this chapter we'll see more into what they are and learn their most used properties.\n\n## DOM node classes\n\nDifferent DOM nodes may have different properties. For instance, an element node corresponding to tag `<a>` has link-related properties, and the one corresponding to `<input>` has input-related properties and so on. Text nodes are not the same as element nodes. But there are also common properties and methods between all of them, because all classes of DOM nodes form a single hierarchy.\n\nEach DOM node belongs to the corresponding built-in class.\n\nThe root of the hierarchy is [EventTarget](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#eventtarget), that is inherited by  [Node](http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-node), and other DOM nodes inherit from it.\n\nHere's the picture, explanations to follow:\n\n![](dom-class-hierarchy.svg)\n\nThe classes are:\n\n- [EventTarget](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#eventtarget) -- is the root \"abstract\" class. Objects of that class are never created. It serves as a base, so that all DOM nodes support so-called \"events\", we'll study them later.\n- [Node](http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-node) -- is also an \"abstract\" class, serving as a base  for DOM nodes. It provides the core tree functionality: `parentNode`, `nextSibling`, `childNodes` and so on (they are getters). Objects of `Node` class are never created. But there are concrete node classes that inherit from it, namely: `Text` for text nodes, `Element` for element nodes and more exotic ones like `Comment` for comment nodes.\n- [Element](http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-element) -- is a base class for DOM elements. It provides element-level navigation like `nextElementSibling`, `children` and searching methods like `getElementsByTagName`, `querySelector`. A browser supports not only HTML, but also XML and SVG. The `Element` class serves as a base for more specific classes: `SVGElement`, `XMLElement` and `HTMLElement`.\n- [HTMLElement](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#htmlelement) -- is finally the basic class for all HTML elements. It is inherited by concrete HTML elements:\n    - [HTMLInputElement](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#htmlinputelement) -- the class for `<input>` elements,\n    - [HTMLBodyElement](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#htmlbodyelement) -- the class for `<body>` elements,\n    - [HTMLAnchorElement](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#htmlanchorelement) -- the class for `<a>` elements,\n    - ...and so on, each tag has its own class that may provide specific properties and methods.\n\nSo, the full set of properties and methods of a given node comes as the result of the inheritance.\n\nFor example, let's consider the DOM object for an `<input>` element. It belongs to [HTMLInputElement](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#htmlinputelement) class.\n\nIt gets properties and methods as a superposition of (listed in inheritance order):\n\n- `HTMLInputElement` -- this class provides input-specific properties,\n- `HTMLElement` -- it provides common HTML element methods (and getters/setters),\n- `Element` -- provides generic element methods,\n- `Node` -- provides common DOM node properties,\n- `EventTarget` -- gives the support for events (to be covered),\n- ...and finally it inherits from `Object`, so \"plain object\" methods like `hasOwnProperty` are also available.\n\nTo see the DOM node class name, we can recall that an object usually has the `constructor` property. It references the class constructor, and `constructor.name` is its name:\n\n```js run\nalert( document.body.constructor.name ); // HTMLBodyElement\n```\n\n...Or we can just `toString` it:\n\n```js run\nalert( document.body ); // [object HTMLBodyElement]\n```\n\nWe also can use `instanceof` to check the inheritance:\n\n```js run\nalert( document.body instanceof HTMLBodyElement ); // true\nalert( document.body instanceof HTMLElement ); // true\nalert( document.body instanceof Element ); // true\nalert( document.body instanceof Node ); // true\nalert( document.body instanceof EventTarget ); // true\n```\n\nAs we can see, DOM nodes are regular JavaScript objects. They use prototype-based classes for inheritance.\n\nThat's also easy to see by outputting an element with `console.dir(elem)` in a browser. There in the console you can see `HTMLElement.prototype`, `Element.prototype` and so on.\n\n```smart header=\"`console.dir(elem)` versus `console.log(elem)`\"\nMost browsers support two commands in their developer tools: `console.log` and `console.dir`. They output their arguments to the console. For JavaScript objects these commands usually do the same.\n\nBut for DOM elements they are different:\n\n- `console.log(elem)` shows the element DOM tree.\n- `console.dir(elem)` shows the element as a DOM object, good to explore its properties.\n\nTry it on `document.body`.\n```\n\n````smart header=\"IDL in the spec\"\nIn the specification, DOM classes aren't described by using JavaScript, but a special [Interface description language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) (IDL), that is usually easy to understand.\n\nIn IDL all properties are prepended with their types. For instance, `DOMString`, `boolean` and so on.\n\nHere's an excerpt from it, with comments:\n\n```js\n// Define HTMLInputElement\n*!*\n// The colon \":\" means that HTMLInputElement inherits from HTMLElement\n*/!*\ninterface HTMLInputElement: HTMLElement {\n  // here go properties and methods of <input> elements\n\n*!*\n  // \"DOMString\" means that the value of a property is a string\n*/!*\n  attribute DOMString accept;\n  attribute DOMString alt;\n  attribute DOMString autocomplete;\n  attribute DOMString value;\n\n*!*\n  // boolean value property (true/false)\n  attribute boolean autofocus;\n*/!*\n  ...\n*!*\n  // now the method: \"void\" means that the method returns no value\n*/!*\n  void select();\n  ...\n}\n```\n````\n\n## The \"nodeType\" property\n\nThe `nodeType` property provides one more, \"old-fashioned\" way to get the \"type\" of a DOM node.\n\nIt has a numeric value:\n- `elem.nodeType == 1` for element nodes,\n- `elem.nodeType == 3` for text nodes,\n- `elem.nodeType == 9` for the document object,\n- there are few other values in [the specification](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#node).\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run\n<body>\n  <script>  \n  let elem = document.body;\n\n  // let's examine what it is?\n  alert(elem.nodeType); // 1 => element\n\n  // and the first child is...\n  alert(elem.firstChild.nodeType); // 3 => text\n\n  // for the document object, the type is 9\n  alert( document.nodeType ); // 9\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\nIn modern scripts, we can use `instanceof` and other class-based tests to see the node type, but sometimes `nodeType` may be simpler. We can only read `nodeType`, not change it.\n\n## Tag: nodeName and tagName\n\nGiven a DOM node, we can read its tag name from `nodeName` or `tagName` properties:\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nalert( document.body.nodeName ); // BODY\nalert( document.body.tagName ); // BODY\n```\n\nIs there any difference between `tagName` and `nodeName`?\n\nSure, the difference is reflected in their names, but is indeed a bit subtle.\n\n- The `tagName` property exists only for `Element` nodes.\n- The `nodeName` is defined for any `Node`:\n    - for elements it means the same as `tagName`.\n    - for other node types (text, comment, etc.) it has a string with the node type.\n\nIn other words, `tagName` is only supported by element nodes (as it originates from `Element` class), while `nodeName` can say something about other node types.\n\nFor instance, let's compare `tagName` and `nodeName` for the `document` and a comment node:\n\n\n```html run\n<body><!-- comment -->\n\n  <script>\n    // for comment\n    alert( document.body.firstChild.tagName ); // undefined (not an element)\n    alert( document.body.firstChild.nodeName ); // #comment\n\n    // for document\n    alert( document.tagName ); // undefined (not an element)\n    alert( document.nodeName ); // #document\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\nIf we only deal with elements, then we can use both `tagName` and `nodeName` - there's no difference.\n\n```smart header=\"The tag name is always uppercase except in XML mode\"\nThe browser has two modes of processing documents: HTML and XML. Usually the HTML-mode is used for webpages. XML-mode is enabled when the browser receives an XML-document with the header: `Content-Type: application/xml+xhtml`.\n\nIn HTML mode `tagName/nodeName` is always uppercased: it's `BODY` either for `<body>` or `<BoDy>`.\n\nIn XML mode the case is kept \"as is\". Nowadays XML mode is rarely used.\n```\n\n\n## innerHTML: the contents\n\nThe [innerHTML](https://w3c.github.io/DOM-Parsing/#widl-Element-innerHTML) property allows to get the HTML inside the element as a string.\n\nWe can also modify it. So it's one of the most powerful ways to change the page.\n\nThe example shows the contents of `document.body` and then replaces it completely:\n\n```html run\n<body>\n  <p>A paragraph</p>\n  <div>A div</div>\n\n  <script>\n    alert( document.body.innerHTML ); // read the current contents\n    document.body.innerHTML = 'The new BODY!'; // replace it\n  </script>\n\n</body>\n```\n\nWe can try to insert invalid HTML, the browser will fix our errors:\n\n```html run\n<body>\n\n  <script>\n    document.body.innerHTML = '<b>test'; // forgot to close the tag\n    alert( document.body.innerHTML ); // <b>test</b> (fixed)\n  </script>\n\n</body>\n```\n\n```smart header=\"Scripts don't execute\"\nIf `innerHTML` inserts a `<script>` tag into the document -- it becomes a part of HTML, but doesn't execute.\n```\n\n### Beware: \"innerHTML+=\" does a full overwrite\n\nWe can append HTML to an element by using `elem.innerHTML+=\"more html\"`.\n\nLike this:\n\n```js\nchatDiv.innerHTML += \"<div>Hello<img src='smile.gif'/> !</div>\";\nchatDiv.innerHTML += \"How goes?\";\n```\n\nBut we should be very careful about doing it, because what's going on is *not* an addition, but a full overwrite.\n\nTechnically, these two lines do the same:\n\n```js\nelem.innerHTML += \"...\";\n// is a shorter way to write:\n*!*\nelem.innerHTML = elem.innerHTML + \"...\"\n*/!*\n```\n\nIn other words, `innerHTML+=` does this:\n\n1. The old contents is removed.\n2. The new `innerHTML` is written instead (a concatenation of the old and the new one).\n\n**As the content is \"zeroed-out\" and rewritten from the scratch, all images and other resources will be reloaded**.\n\nIn the `chatDiv` example above the line `chatDiv.innerHTML+=\"How goes?\"` re-creates the HTML content and reloads `smile.gif` (hope it's cached). If `chatDiv` has a lot of other text and images, then the reload becomes clearly visible.\n\nThere are other side-effects as well. For instance, if the existing text was selected with the mouse, then most browsers will remove the selection upon rewriting `innerHTML`. And if there was an `<input>` with a text entered by the visitor, then the text will be removed. And so on.\n\nLuckily, there are other ways to add HTML besides `innerHTML`, and we'll study them soon.\n\n## outerHTML: full HTML of the element\n\nThe `outerHTML` property contains the full HTML of the element. That's like `innerHTML` plus the element itself.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```html run\n<div id=\"elem\">Hello <b>World</b></div>\n\n<script>\n  alert(elem.outerHTML); // <div id=\"elem\">Hello <b>World</b></div>\n</script>\n```\n\n**Beware: unlike `innerHTML`, writing to `outerHTML` does not change the element. Instead, it replaces it in the DOM.**\n\nYeah, sounds strange, and strange it is, that's why we make a separate note about it here. Take a look.\n\nConsider the example:\n\n```html run\n<div>Hello, world!</div>\n\n<script>\n  let div = document.querySelector('div');\n\n*!*\n  // replace div.outerHTML with <p>...</p>\n*/!*\n  div.outerHTML = '<p>A new element</p>'; // (*)\n\n*!*\n  // Wow! 'div' is still the same!\n*/!*\n  alert(div.outerHTML); // <div>Hello, world!</div> (**)\n</script>\n```\n\nLooks really odd, right?\n\nIn the line `(*)` we replaced `div` with `<p>A new element</p>`. In the outer document (the DOM) we can see the new content instead of the `<div>`. But, as we can see in line `(**)`, the value of the old `div` variable hasn't changed!\n\nThe `outerHTML` assignment does not modify the DOM element (the object referenced by, in this case, the variable 'div'), but removes it from the DOM and inserts the new HTML in its place.\n\nSo what happened in `div.outerHTML=...` is:\n- `div` was removed from the document.\n- Another piece of HTML `<p>A new element</p>` was inserted in its place.\n- `div` still has its old value. The new HTML wasn't saved to any variable.\n\nIt's so easy to make an error here: modify `div.outerHTML` and then continue to work with `div` as if it had the new content in it. But it doesn't. Such thing is correct for `innerHTML`, but not for `outerHTML`.\n\nWe can write to `elem.outerHTML`, but should keep in mind that it doesn't change the element we're writing to ('elem'). It puts the new HTML in its place instead. We can get references to the new elements by querying the DOM.\n\n## nodeValue/data: text node content\n\nThe `innerHTML` property is only valid for element nodes.\n\nOther node types, such as text nodes, have their counterpart: `nodeValue` and `data` properties. These two are almost the same for practical use, there are only minor specification differences. So we'll use `data`, because it's shorter.\n\nAn example of reading the content of a text node and a comment:\n\n```html run height=\"50\"\n<body>\n  Hello\n  <!-- Comment -->\n  <script>\n    let text = document.body.firstChild;\n*!*\n    alert(text.data); // Hello\n*/!*\n\n    let comment = text.nextSibling;\n*!*\n    alert(comment.data); // Comment\n*/!*\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\nFor text nodes we can imagine a reason to read or modify them, but why comments?\n\nSometimes developers embed information or template instructions into HTML in them, like this:\n\n```html\n<!-- if isAdmin -->\n  <div>Welcome, Admin!</div>\n<!-- /if -->\n```\n\n...Then JavaScript can read it from `data` property and process embedded instructions.\n\n## textContent: pure text\n\nThe `textContent` provides access to the *text* inside the element: only text, minus all `<tags>`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run\n<div id=\"news\">\n  <h1>Headline!</h1>\n  <p>Martians attack people!</p>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n  // Headline! Martians attack people!\n  alert(news.textContent);\n</script>\n```\n\nAs we can see, only text is returned, as if all `<tags>` were cut out, but the text in them remained.\n\nIn practice, reading such text is rarely needed.\n\n**Writing to `textContent` is much more useful, because it allows to write text the \"safe way\".**\n\nLet's say we have an arbitrary string, for instance entered by a user, and want to show it.\n\n- With `innerHTML` we'll have it inserted \"as HTML\", with all HTML tags.\n- With `textContent` we'll have it inserted \"as text\", all symbols are treated literally.\n\nCompare the two:\n\n```html run\n<div id=\"elem1\"></div>\n<div id=\"elem2\"></div>\n\n<script>\n  let name = prompt(\"What's your name?\", \"<b>Winnie-the-pooh!</b>\");\n\n  elem1.innerHTML = name;\n  elem2.textContent = name;\n</script>\n```\n\n1. The first `<div>` gets the name \"as HTML\": all tags become tags, so we see the bold name.\n2. The second `<div>` gets the name \"as text\", so we literally see `<b>Winnie-the-pooh!</b>`.\n\nIn most cases, we expect the text from a user, and want to treat it as text. We don't want unexpected HTML in our site. An assignment to `textContent` does exactly that.\n\n## The \"hidden\" property\n\nThe \"hidden\" attribute and the DOM property specifies whether the element is visible or not.\n\nWe can use it in HTML or assign using JavaScript, like this:\n\n```html run height=\"80\"\n<div>Both divs below are hidden</div>\n\n<div hidden>With the attribute \"hidden\"</div>\n\n<div id=\"elem\">JavaScript assigned the property \"hidden\"</div>\n\n<script>\n  elem.hidden = true;\n</script>\n```\n\nTechnically, `hidden` works the same as `style=\"display:none\"`. But it's shorter to write.\n\nHere's a blinking element:\n\n\n```html run height=50\n<div id=\"elem\">A blinking element</div>\n\n<script>\n  setInterval(() => elem.hidden = !elem.hidden, 1000);\n</script>\n```\n\n## More properties\n\nDOM elements also have additional properties, in particular those that depend on the class:\n\n- `value` -- the value for `<input>`, `<select>` and `<textarea>` (`HTMLInputElement`, `HTMLSelectElement`...).\n- `href` -- the \"href\" for `<a href=\"...\">` (`HTMLAnchorElement`).\n- `id` -- the value of \"id\" attribute, for all elements (`HTMLElement`).\n- ...and much more...\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run height=\"80\"\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"elem\" value=\"value\">\n\n<script>\n  alert(elem.type); // \"text\"\n  alert(elem.id); // \"elem\"\n  alert(elem.value); // value\n</script>\n```\n\nMost standard HTML attributes have the corresponding DOM property, and we can access it like that.\n\nIf we want to know the full list of supported properties for a given class, we can find them in the specification. For instance, `HTMLInputElement` is documented at <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#htmlinputelement>.\n\nOr if we'd like to get them fast or are interested in a concrete browser specification -- we can always output the element using `console.dir(elem)` and read the properties. Or explore \"DOM properties\" in the Elements tab of the browser developer tools.\n\n## Summary\n\nEach DOM node belongs to a certain class. The classes form a hierarchy. The full set of properties and methods come as the result of inheritance.\n\nMain DOM node properties are:\n\n`nodeType`\n: We can use it to see if a node is a text or an element node. It has a numeric value: `1` for elements,`3` for text nodes, and a few others for other node types. Read-only.\n\n`nodeName/tagName`\n: For elements, tag name (uppercased unless XML-mode). For non-element nodes `nodeName` describes what it is. Read-only.\n\n`innerHTML`\n: The HTML content of the element. Can be modified.\n\n`outerHTML`\n: The full HTML of the element. A write operation into `elem.outerHTML` does not touch `elem` itself. Instead it gets replaced with the new HTML in the outer context.\n\n`nodeValue/data`\n: The content of a non-element node (text, comment). These two are almost the same, usually we use `data`. Can be modified.\n\n`textContent`\n: The text inside the element: HTML minus all `<tags>`. Writing into it puts the text inside the element, with all special characters and tags treated exactly as text. Can safely insert user-generated text and protect from unwanted HTML insertions.\n\n`hidden`\n: When set to `true`, does the same as CSS `display:none`.\n\nDOM nodes also have other properties depending on their class. For instance, `<input>` elements (`HTMLInputElement`) support `value`, `type`, while `<a>` elements (`HTMLAnchorElement`) support `href` etc. Most standard HTML attributes have a corresponding DOM property.\n\nHowever, HTML attributes and DOM properties are not always the same, as we'll see in the next chapter.",

        "content": "\n\nWhen the browser loads the page, it \"reads\" (another word: \"parses\") the HTML and generates DOM objects from it. For element nodes, most standard HTML attributes automatically become properties of DOM objects.\n\nFor instance, if the tag is `<body id=\"page\">`, then the DOM object has `body.id=\"page\"`.\n\nBut the attribute-property mapping is not one-to-one! In this chapter we'll pay attention to separate these two notions, to see how to work with them, when they are the same, and when they are different.\n\n## DOM properties\n\nWe've already seen built-in DOM properties. There are a lot. But technically no one limits us, and if there aren't enough, we can add our own.\n\nDOM nodes are regular JavaScript objects. We can alter them.\n\nFor instance, let's create a new property in `document.body`:\n\n```js run\ndocument.body.myData = {\n  name: 'Caesar',\n  title: 'Imperator'\n};\n\nalert(document.body.myData.title); // Imperator\n```\n\nWe can add a method as well:\n\n```js run\ndocument.body.sayTagName = function() {\n  alert(this.tagName);\n};\n\ndocument.body.sayTagName(); // BODY (the value of \"this\" in the method is document.body)\n```\n\nWe can also modify built-in prototypes like `Element.prototype` and add new methods to all elements:\n\n```js run\nElement.prototype.sayHi = function() {\n  alert(`Hello, I'm ${this.tagName}`);\n};\n\ndocument.documentElement.sayHi(); // Hello, I'm HTML\ndocument.body.sayHi(); // Hello, I'm BODY\n```\n\nSo, DOM properties and methods behave just like those of regular JavaScript objects:\n\n- They can have any value.\n- They are case-sensitive (write `elem.nodeType`, not `elem.NoDeTyPe`).\n\n## HTML attributes\n\nIn HTML, tags may have attributes. When the browser parses the HTML to create DOM objects for tags, it recognizes *standard* attributes and creates DOM properties from them.\n\nSo when an element has `id` or another *standard* attribute, the corresponding property gets created. But that doesn't happen if the attribute is non-standard.\n\nFor instance:\n```html run\n<body id=\"test\" something=\"non-standard\">\n  <script>\n    alert(document.body.id); // test\n*!*\n    // non-standard attribute does not yield a property\n    alert(document.body.something); // undefined\n*/!*\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\nPlease note that a standard attribute for one element can be unknown for another one. For instance, `\"type\"` is standard for `<input>` ([HTMLInputElement](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#htmlinputelement)), but not for `<body>` ([HTMLBodyElement](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#htmlbodyelement)). Standard attributes are described in the specification for the corresponding element class.\n\nHere we can see it:\n```html run\n<body id=\"body\" type=\"...\">\n  <input id=\"input\" type=\"text\">\n  <script>\n    alert(input.type); // text\n*!*\n    alert(body.type); // undefined: DOM property not created, because it's non-standard\n*/!*\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\nSo, if an attribute is non-standard, there won't be a DOM-property for it. Is there a way to access such attributes?\n\nSure. All attributes are accessible by using the following methods:\n\n- `elem.hasAttribute(name)` -- checks for existence.\n- `elem.getAttribute(name)` -- gets the value.\n- `elem.setAttribute(name, value)` -- sets the value.\n- `elem.removeAttribute(name)` -- removes the attribute.\n\nThese methods operate exactly with what's written in HTML.\n\nAlso one can read all attributes using `elem.attributes`: a collection of objects that belong to a built-in [Attr](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#attr) class, with `name` and `value` properties.\n\nHere's a demo of reading a non-standard property:\n\n```html run\n<body something=\"non-standard\">\n  <script>\n*!*\n    alert(document.body.getAttribute('something')); // non-standard\n*/!*\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\nHTML attributes have the following features:\n\n- Their name is case-insensitive (`id` is same as `ID`).\n- Their values are always strings.\n\nHere's an extended demo of working with attributes:\n\n```html run\n<body>\n  <div id=\"elem\" about=\"Elephant\"></div>\n\n  <script>\n    alert( elem.getAttribute('About') ); // (1) 'Elephant', reading\n\n    elem.setAttribute('Test', 123); // (2), writing\n\n    alert( elem.outerHTML ); // (3), see if the attribute is in HTML (yes)\n\n    for (let attr of elem.attributes) { // (4) list all\n      alert( `${attr.name} = ${attr.value}` );\n    }\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\nPlease note:\n\n1. `getAttribute('About')` -- the first letter is uppercase here, and in HTML it's all lowercase. But that doesn't matter: attribute names are case-insensitive.\n2. We can assign anything to an attribute, but it becomes a string. So here we have `\"123\"` as the value.\n3. All attributes including ones that we set are visible in `outerHTML`.\n4. The `attributes` collection is iterable and has all the attributes of the element (standard and non-standard) as objects with `name` and `value` properties.\n\n## Property-attribute synchronization\n\nWhen a standard attribute changes, the corresponding property is auto-updated, and (with some exceptions) vice versa.\n\nIn the example below `id` is modified as an attribute, and we can see the property changed too. And then the same backwards:\n\n```html run\n<input>\n\n<script>\n  let input = document.querySelector('input');\n\n  // attribute => property\n  input.setAttribute('id', 'id');\n  alert(input.id); // id (updated)\n\n  // property => attribute\n  input.id = 'newId';\n  alert(input.getAttribute('id')); // newId (updated)\n</script>\n```\n\nBut there are exclusions, for instance `input.value` synchronizes only from attribute -> to property, but not back:\n\n```html run\n<input>\n\n<script>\n  let input = document.querySelector('input');\n\n  // attribute => property\n  input.setAttribute('value', 'text');\n  alert(input.value); // text\n\n*!*\n  // NOT property => attribute\n  input.value = 'newValue';\n  alert(input.getAttribute('value')); // text (not updated!)\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\nIn the example above:\n- Changing the attribute `value` updates the property.\n- But the property change does not affect the attribute.\n\nThat \"feature\" may actually come in handy, because the user actions may lead to `value` changes, and then after them, if we want to recover the \"original\" value from HTML, it's in the attribute.\n\n## DOM properties are typed\n\nDOM properties are not always strings. For instance, the `input.checked` property (for checkboxes) is a boolean:\n\n```html run\n<input id=\"input\" type=\"checkbox\" checked> checkbox\n\n<script>\n  alert(input.getAttribute('checked')); // the attribute value is: empty string\n  alert(input.checked); // the property value is: true\n</script>\n```\n\nThere are other examples. The `style` attribute is a string, but the `style` property is an object:\n\n```html run\n<div id=\"div\" style=\"color:red;font-size:120%\">Hello</div>\n\n<script>\n  // string\n  alert(div.getAttribute('style')); // color:red;font-size:120%\n\n  // object\n  alert(div.style); // [object CSSStyleDeclaration]\n  alert(div.style.color); // red\n</script>\n```\n\nMost properties are strings though.\n\nQuite rarely, even if a DOM property type is a string, it may differ from the attribute. For instance, the `href` DOM property is always a *full* URL, even if the attribute contains a relative URL or just a `#hash`.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```html height=30 run\n<a id=\"a\" href=\"#hello\">link</a>\n<script>\n  // attribute\n  alert(a.getAttribute('href')); // #hello\n\n  // property\n  alert(a.href ); // full URL in the form http://site.com/page#hello\n</script>\n```\n\nIf we need the value of `href` or any other attribute exactly as written in the HTML, we can use `getAttribute`.\n\n\n## Non-standard attributes, dataset\n\nWhen writing HTML, we use a lot of standard attributes. But what about non-standard, custom ones? First, let's see whether they are useful or not? What for?\n\nSometimes non-standard attributes are used to pass custom data from HTML to JavaScript, or to \"mark\" HTML-elements for JavaScript.\n\nLike this:\n\n```html run\n<!-- mark the div to show \"name\" here -->\n<div *!*show-info=\"name\"*/!*></div>\n<!-- and age here -->\n<div *!*show-info=\"age\"*/!*></div>\n\n<script>\n  // the code finds an element with the mark and shows what's requested\n  let user = {\n    name: \"Pete\",\n    age: 25\n  };\n\n  for(let div of document.querySelectorAll('[show-info]')) {\n    // insert the corresponding info into the field\n    let field = div.getAttribute('show-info');\n    div.innerHTML = user[field]; // first Pete into \"name\", then 25 into \"age\"\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\nAlso they can be used to style an element.\n\nFor instance, here for the order state the attribute `order-state` is used:\n\n```html run\n<style>\n  /* styles rely on the custom attribute \"order-state\" */\n  .order[order-state=\"new\"] {\n    color: green;\n  }\n\n  .order[order-state=\"pending\"] {\n    color: blue;\n  }\n\n  .order[order-state=\"canceled\"] {\n    color: red;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<div class=\"order\" order-state=\"new\">\n  A new order.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"order\" order-state=\"pending\">\n  A pending order.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"order\" order-state=\"canceled\">\n  A canceled order.\n</div>\n```\n\nWhy would using an attribute be preferable to having classes like `.order-state-new`, `.order-state-pending`, `order-state-canceled`?\n\nBecause an attribute is more convenient to manage. The state can be changed as easy as:\n\n```js\n// a bit simpler than removing old/adding a new class\ndiv.setAttribute('order-state', 'canceled');\n```\n\nBut there may be a possible problem with custom attributes. What if we use a non-standard attribute for our purposes and later the standard introduces it and makes it do something? The HTML language is alive, it grows, and more attributes appear to suit the needs of developers. There may be unexpected effects in such case.\n\nTo avoid conflicts, there exist [data-*](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-*-attributes) attributes.\n\n**All attributes starting with \"data-\" are reserved for programmers' use. They are available in the `dataset` property.**\n\nFor instance, if an `elem` has an attribute named `\"data-about\"`, it's available as `elem.dataset.about`.\n\nLike this:\n\n```html run\n<body data-about=\"Elephants\">\n<script>\n  alert(document.body.dataset.about); // Elephants\n</script>\n```\n\nMultiword attributes like `data-order-state` become camel-cased: `dataset.orderState`.\n\nHere's a rewritten \"order state\" example:\n\n```html run\n<style>\n  .order[data-order-state=\"new\"] {\n    color: green;\n  }\n\n  .order[data-order-state=\"pending\"] {\n    color: blue;\n  }\n\n  .order[data-order-state=\"canceled\"] {\n    color: red;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<div id=\"order\" class=\"order\" data-order-state=\"new\">\n  A new order.\n</div>\n\n<script>\n  // read\n  alert(order.dataset.orderState); // new\n\n  // modify\n  order.dataset.orderState = \"pending\"; // (*)\n</script>\n```\n\nUsing `data-*` attributes is a valid, safe way to pass custom data.\n\nPlease note that we can not only read, but also modify data-attributes. Then CSS updates the view accordingly: in the example above the last line `(*)` changes the color to blue.\n\n## Summary\n\n- Attributes -- is what's written in HTML.\n- Properties -- is what's in DOM objects.\n\nA small comparison:\n\n|            | Properties | Attributes |\n|------------|------------|------------|\n|Type|Any value, standard properties have types described in the spec|A string|\n|Name|Name is case-sensitive|Name is not case-sensitive|\n\nMethods to work with attributes are:\n\n- `elem.hasAttribute(name)` -- to check for existence.\n- `elem.getAttribute(name)` -- to get the value.\n- `elem.setAttribute(name, value)` -- to set the value.\n- `elem.removeAttribute(name)` -- to remove the attribute.\n- `elem.attributes` is a collection of all attributes.\n\nFor most situations using DOM properties is preferable. We should refer to attributes only when DOM properties do not suit us, when we need exactly attributes, for instance:\n\n- We need a non-standard attribute. But if it starts with `data-`, then we should use `dataset`.\n- We want to read the value \"as written\" in HTML. The value of the DOM property may be different, for instance the `href` property is always a full URL, and we may want to get the \"original\" value.",

        "content": "\n\nDOM modification is the key to creating \"live\" pages.\n\nHere we'll see how to create new elements \"on the fly\" and modify the existing page content.\n\n## Example: show a message\n\nLet's demonstrate using an example. We'll add a message on the page that looks nicer than `alert`.\n\nHere's how it will look:\n\n```html autorun height=\"80\"\n<style>\n.alert {\n  padding: 15px;\n  border: 1px solid #d6e9c6;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  color: #3c763d;\n  background-color: #dff0d8;\n}\n</style>\n\n*!*\n<div class=\"alert\">\n  <strong>Hi there!</strong> You've read an important message.\n</div>\n*/!*\n```\n\nThat was an HTML example. Now let's create the same `div` with JavaScript (assuming that the styles are in the HTML or an external CSS file).\n\n## Creating an element\n\nTo create DOM nodes, there are two methods:\n\n`document.createElement(tag)`\n: Creates a new *element node* with the given tag:\n\n    ```js\n    let div = document.createElement('div');\n    ```\n\n`document.createTextNode(text)`\n: Creates a new *text node* with the given text:\n\n    ```js\n    let textNode = document.createTextNode('Here I am');\n    ```\n\n### Creating the message\n\nIn our case the message is a `div` with `alert` class and the HTML in it:\n\n```js\nlet div = document.createElement('div');\ndiv.className = \"alert\";\ndiv.innerHTML = \"<strong>Hi there!</strong> You've read an important message.\";\n```\n\nWe created the element, but as of now it's only in a variable. We can't see the element on the page, as it's not yet a part of the document.\n\n## Insertion methods\n\nTo make the `div` show up, we need to insert it somewhere into `document`. For instance, in `document.body`.\n\nThere's a special method `append` for that: `document.body.append(div)`.\n\nHere's the full code:\n\n```html run height=\"80\"\n<style>\n.alert {\n  padding: 15px;\n  border: 1px solid #d6e9c6;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  color: #3c763d;\n  background-color: #dff0d8;\n}\n</style>\n\n<script>\n  let div = document.createElement('div');\n  div.className = \"alert\";\n  div.innerHTML = \"<strong>Hi there!</strong> You've read an important message.\";\n\n*!*\n  document.body.append(div);\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\nThis set of methods provides more ways to insert:\n\n- `node.append(...nodes or strings)` -- append nodes or strings at the end of `node`,\n- `node.prepend(...nodes or strings)` -- insert nodes or strings at the beginning of `node`,\n- `node.before(...nodes or strings)` –- insert nodes or strings before `node`,\n- `node.after(...nodes or strings)` –- insert nodes or strings after `node`,\n- `node.replaceWith(...nodes or strings)` –- replaces `node` with the given nodes or strings.\n\nHere's an example of using these methods to add items to a list and the text before/after it:\n\n```html autorun\n<ol id=\"ol\">\n  <li>0</li>\n  <li>1</li>\n  <li>2</li>\n</ol>\n\n<script>\n  ol.before('before'); // insert string \"before\" before <ol>\n  ol.after('after'); // insert string \"after\" after <ol>\n\n  let liFirst = document.createElement('li');\n  liFirst.innerHTML = 'prepend';\n  ol.prepend(liFirst); // insert liFirst at the beginning of <ol>\n\n  let liLast = document.createElement('li');\n  liLast.innerHTML = 'append';\n  ol.append(liLast); // insert liLast at the end of <ol>\n</script>\n```\n\nHere's a visual picture what methods do:\n\n![](before-prepend-append-after.svg)\n\nSo the final list will be:\n\n```html\nbefore\n<ol id=\"ol\">\n  <li>prepend</li>\n  <li>0</li>\n  <li>1</li>\n  <li>2</li>\n  <li>append</li>\n</ol>\nafter\n```\n\nThese methods can insert multiple lists of nodes and text pieces in a single call.\n\nFor instance, here a string and an element are inserted:\n\n```html run\n<div id=\"div\"></div>\n<script>\n  div.before('<p>Hello</p>', document.createElement('hr'));\n</script>\n```\n\nAll text is inserted *as text*.\n\nSo the final HTML is:\n\n```html run\n*!*\n&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;\n*/!*\n<hr>\n<div id=\"div\"></div>\n```\n\nIn other words, strings are inserted in a safe way, like `elem.textContent` does it.\n\nSo, these methods can only be used to insert DOM nodes or text pieces.\n\nBut what if we want to insert HTML \"as html\", with all tags and stuff working, like `elem.innerHTML`?\n\n## insertAdjacentHTML/Text/Element\n\nFor that we can use another, pretty versatile method: `elem.insertAdjacentHTML(where, html)`.\n\nThe first parameter is a code word, specifying where to insert relative to `elem`. Must be one of the following:\n\n- `\"beforebegin\"` -- insert `html` immediately before `elem`,\n- `\"afterbegin\"` -- insert `html` into `elem`, at the beginning,\n- `\"beforeend\"` -- insert `html` into `elem`, at the end,\n- `\"afterend\"` -- insert `html` immediately after `elem`.\n\nThe second parameter is an HTML string, that is inserted \"as HTML\".\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run\n<div id=\"div\"></div>\n<script>\n  div.insertAdjacentHTML('beforebegin', '<p>Hello</p>');\n  div.insertAdjacentHTML('afterend', '<p>Bye</p>');\n</script>\n```\n\n...Would lead to:\n\n```html run\n<p>Hello</p>\n<div id=\"div\"></div>\n<p>Bye</p>\n```\n\nThat's how we can append arbitrary HTML to the page.\n\nHere's the picture of insertion variants:\n\n![](insert-adjacent.svg)\n\nWe can easily notice similarities between this and the previous picture. The insertion points are actually the same, but this method inserts HTML.\n\nThe method has two brothers:\n\n- `elem.insertAdjacentText(where, text)` -- the same syntax, but a string of `text` is inserted \"as text\" instead of HTML,\n- `elem.insertAdjacentElement(where, elem)` -- the same syntax, but inserts an element.\n\nThey exist mainly to make the syntax \"uniform\". In practice, only `insertAdjacentHTML` is used most of the time. Because for elements and text, we have methods `append/prepend/before/after` -- they are shorter to write and can insert nodes/text pieces.\n\nSo here's an alternative variant of showing a message:\n\n```html run\n<style>\n.alert {\n  padding: 15px;\n  border: 1px solid #d6e9c6;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  color: #3c763d;\n  background-color: #dff0d8;\n}\n</style>\n\n<script>\n  document.body.insertAdjacentHTML(\"afterbegin\", `<div class=\"alert\">\n    <strong>Hi there!</strong> You've read an important message.\n  </div>`);\n</script>\n```\n\n## Node removal\n\nTo remove a node, there's a method `node.remove()`.\n\nLet's make our message disappear after a second:\n\n```html run untrusted\n<style>\n.alert {\n  padding: 15px;\n  border: 1px solid #d6e9c6;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  color: #3c763d;\n  background-color: #dff0d8;\n}\n</style>\n\n<script>\n  let div = document.createElement('div');\n  div.className = \"alert\";\n  div.innerHTML = \"<strong>Hi there!</strong> You've read an important message.\";\n\n  document.body.append(div);\n*!*\n  setTimeout(() => div.remove(), 1000);\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\nPlease note: if we want to *move* an element to another place -- there's no need to remove it from the old one.\n\n**All insertion methods automatically remove the node from the old place.**\n\nFor instance, let's swap elements:\n\n```html run height=50\n<div id=\"first\">First</div>\n<div id=\"second\">Second</div>\n<script>\n  // no need to call remove\n  second.after(first); // take #second and after it insert #first\n</script>\n```\n\n## Cloning nodes: cloneNode\n\nHow to insert one more similar message?\n\nWe could make a function and put the code there. But the alternative way would be to *clone* the existing `div` and modify the text inside it (if needed).\n\nSometimes when we have a big element, that may be faster and simpler.\n\n- The call `elem.cloneNode(true)` creates a \"deep\" clone of the element -- with all attributes and subelements. If we call `elem.cloneNode(false)`, then the clone is made without child elements.\n\nAn example of copying the message:\n\n```html run height=\"120\"\n<style>\n.alert {\n  padding: 15px;\n  border: 1px solid #d6e9c6;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  color: #3c763d;\n  background-color: #dff0d8;\n}\n</style>\n\n<div class=\"alert\" id=\"div\">\n  <strong>Hi there!</strong> You've read an important message.\n</div>\n\n<script>\n*!*\n  let div2 = div.cloneNode(true); // clone the message\n  div2.querySelector('strong').innerHTML = 'Bye there!'; // change the clone\n\n  div.after(div2); // show the clone after the existing div\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\n## DocumentFragment [#document-fragment]\n\n`DocumentFragment` is a special DOM node that serves as a wrapper to pass around lists of nodes.\n\nWe can append other nodes to it, but when we insert it somewhere, then its content is inserted instead.\n\nFor example, `getListContent` below generates a fragment with `<li>` items, that are later inserted into `<ul>`:\n\n```html run\n<ul id=\"ul\"></ul>\n\n<script>\nfunction getListContent() {\n  let fragment = new DocumentFragment();\n\n  for(let i=1; i<=3; i++) {\n    let li = document.createElement('li');\n    li.append(i);\n    fragment.append(li);\n  }\n\n  return fragment;\n}\n\n*!*\nul.append(getListContent()); // (*)\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\nPlease note, at the last line `(*)` we append `DocumentFragment`, but it \"blends in\", so the resulting structure will be:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li>1</li>\n  <li>2</li>\n  <li>3</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n`DocumentFragment` is rarely used explicitly. Why append to a special kind of node, if we can return an array of nodes instead? Rewritten example:\n\n```html run\n<ul id=\"ul\"></ul>\n\n<script>\nfunction getListContent() {\n  let result = [];\n\n  for(let i=1; i<=3; i++) {\n    let li = document.createElement('li');\n    li.append(i);\n    result.push(li);\n  }\n\n  return result;\n}\n\n*!*\nul.append(...getListContent()); // append + \"...\" operator = friends!\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\nWe mention `DocumentFragment` mainly because there are some concepts on top of it, like [template](info:template-element) element, that we'll cover much later.\n\n## Old-school insert/remove methods\n\n[old]\n\nThere are also \"old school\" DOM manipulation methods, existing for historical reasons.\n\nThese methods come from really ancient times. Nowadays, there's no reason to use them, as modern methods, such as `append`, `prepend`, `before`, `after`, `remove`, `replaceWith`, are more flexible.\n\nThe only reason we list these methods here is that you can find them in many old scripts:\n\n`parentElem.appendChild(node)`\n: Appends `node` as the last child of `parentElem`.\n\n    The following example adds a new `<li>` to the end of `<ol>`:\n\n    ```html run height=100\n    <ol id=\"list\">\n      <li>0</li>\n      <li>1</li>\n      <li>2</li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <script>\n      let newLi = document.createElement('li');\n      newLi.innerHTML = 'Hello, world!';\n\n      list.appendChild(newLi);\n    </script>\n    ```\n\n`parentElem.insertBefore(node, nextSibling)`\n: Inserts `node` before `nextSibling` into `parentElem`.\n\n    The following code inserts a new list item before the second `<li>`:\n\n    ```html run height=100\n    <ol id=\"list\">\n      <li>0</li>\n      <li>1</li>\n      <li>2</li>\n    </ol>\n    <script>\n      let newLi = document.createElement('li');\n      newLi.innerHTML = 'Hello, world!';\n\n    *!*\n      list.insertBefore(newLi, list.children[1]);\n    */!*\n    </script>\n    ```\n    To insert `newLi` as the first element, we can do it like this:\n\n    ```js\n    list.insertBefore(newLi, list.firstChild);\n    ```\n\n`parentElem.replaceChild(node, oldChild)`\n: Replaces `oldChild` with `node` among children of `parentElem`.\n\n`parentElem.removeChild(node)`\n: Removes `node` from `parentElem` (assuming `node` is its child).\n\n    The following example removes first `<li>` from `<ol>`:\n\n    ```html run height=100\n    <ol id=\"list\">\n      <li>0</li>\n      <li>1</li>\n      <li>2</li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <script>\n      let li = list.firstElementChild;\n      list.removeChild(li);\n    </script>\n    ```\n\nAll these methods return the inserted/removed node. In other words, `parentElem.appendChild(node)` returns `node`. But usually the returned value is not used, we just run the method.\n\n## A word about \"document.write\"\n\nThere's one more, very ancient method of adding something to a web-page: `document.write`.\n\nThe syntax:\n\n```html run\n<p>Somewhere in the page...</p>\n*!*\n<script>\n  document.write('<b>Hello from JS</b>');\n</script>\n*/!*\n<p>The end</p>\n```\n\nThe call to `document.write(html)` writes the `html` into page \"right here and now\". The `html` string can be dynamically generated, so it's kind of flexible. We can use JavaScript to create a full-fledged webpage and write it.\n\nThe method comes from times when there was no DOM, no standards... Really old times. It still lives, because there are scripts using it.\n\nIn modern scripts we can rarely see it, because of the following important limitation:\n\n**The call to `document.write` only works while the page is loading.**\n\nIf we call it afterwards, the existing document content is erased.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run\n<p>After one second the contents of this page will be replaced...</p>\n*!*\n<script>\n  // document.write after 1 second\n  // that's after the page loaded, so it erases the existing content\n  setTimeout(() => document.write('<b>...By this.</b>'), 1000);\n</script>\n*/!*\n```\n\nSo it's kind of unusable at \"after loaded\" stage, unlike other DOM methods we covered above.\n\nThat's the downside.\n\nThere's an upside also. Technically, when `document.write` is called while the browser is reading (\"parsing\") incoming HTML, and it writes something, the browser consumes it just as if it were initially there, in the HTML text.\n\nSo it works blazingly fast, because there's *no DOM modification* involved. It writes directly into the page text, while the DOM is not yet built.\n\nSo if we need to add a lot of text into HTML dynamically, and we're at page loading phase, and the speed matters, it may help. But in practice these requirements rarely come together. And usually we can see this method in scripts just because they are old.\n\n## Summary\n\n- Methods to create new nodes:\n    - `document.createElement(tag)` -- creates an element with the given tag,\n    - `document.createTextNode(value)` -- creates a text node (rarely used),\n    - `elem.cloneNode(deep)` -- clones the element, if `deep==true` then with all descendants.  \n\n- Insertion and removal:\n    - `node.append(...nodes or strings)` -- insert into `node`, at the end,\n    - `node.prepend(...nodes or strings)` -- insert into `node`, at the beginning,\n    - `node.before(...nodes or strings)` –- insert right before `node`,\n    - `node.after(...nodes or strings)` –- insert right after `node`,\n    - `node.replaceWith(...nodes or strings)` –- replace `node`.\n    - `node.remove()` –- remove the `node`.\n\n    Text strings are inserted \"as text\".\n\n- There are also \"old school\" methods:\n    - `parent.appendChild(node)`\n    - `parent.insertBefore(node, nextSibling)`\n    - `parent.removeChild(node)`\n    - `parent.replaceChild(newElem, node)`\n\n    All these methods return `node`.\n\n- Given some HTML in `html`, `elem.insertAdjacentHTML(where, html)` inserts it depending on the value of `where`:\n    - `\"beforebegin\"` -- insert `html` right before `elem`,\n    - `\"afterbegin\"` -- insert `html` into `elem`, at the beginning,\n    - `\"beforeend\"` -- insert `html` into `elem`, at the end,\n    - `\"afterend\"` -- insert `html` right after `elem`.\n\n    Also there are similar methods, `elem.insertAdjacentText` and `elem.insertAdjacentElement`, that insert text strings and elements, but they are rarely used.\n\n- To append HTML to the page before it has finished loading:\n    - `document.write(html)`\n\n    After the page is loaded such a call erases the document. Mostly seen in old scripts.",

        "content": "\n\nBefore we get into JavaScript's ways of dealing with styles and classes -- here's an important rule. Hopefully it's obvious enough, but we still have to mention it.\n\nThere are generally two ways to style an element:\n\n1. Create a class in CSS and add it: `<div class=\"...\">`\n2. Write properties directly into `style`: `<div style=\"...\">`.\n\nJavaScript can modify both classes and `style` properties.\n\nWe should always prefer CSS classes to `style`. The latter should only be used if classes \"can't handle it\".\n\nFor example, `style` is acceptable if we calculate coordinates of an element dynamically and want to set them from JavaScript, like this:\n\n```js\nlet top = /* complex calculations */;\nlet left = /* complex calculations */;\n\nelem.style.left = left; // e.g '123px', calculated at run-time\nelem.style.top = top; // e.g '456px'\n```\n\nFor other cases, like making the text red, adding a background icon -- describe that in CSS and then add the class (JavaScript can do that). That's more flexible and easier to support.\n\n## className and classList\n\nChanging a class is one of the most often used actions in scripts.\n\nIn the ancient time, there was a limitation in JavaScript: a reserved word like `\"class\"` could not be an object property. That limitation does not exist now, but at that time it was impossible to have a `\"class\"` property, like `elem.class`.\n\nSo for classes the similar-looking property `\"className\"` was introduced: the `elem.className` corresponds to the `\"class\"` attribute.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run\n<body class=\"main page\">\n  <script>\n    alert(document.body.className); // main page\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\nIf we assign something to `elem.className`, it replaces the whole string of classes. Sometimes that's what we need, but often we want to add/remove a single class.\n\nThere's another property for that: `elem.classList`.\n\nThe `elem.classList` is a special object with methods to `add/remove/toggle` a single class.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run\n<body class=\"main page\">\n  <script>\n*!*\n    // add a class\n    document.body.classList.add('article');\n*/!*\n\n    alert(document.body.className); // main page article\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\nSo we can operate both on the full class string using `className` or on individual classes using `classList`. What we choose depends on our needs.\n\nMethods of `classList`:\n\n- `elem.classList.add/remove(\"class\")` -- adds/removes the class.\n- `elem.classList.toggle(\"class\")` -- adds the class if it doesn't exist, otherwise removes it.\n- `elem.classList.contains(\"class\")` -- checks for the given class, returns `true/false`.\n\nBesides, `classList` is iterable, so we can list all classes with `for..of`, like this:\n\n```html run\n<body class=\"main page\">\n  <script>\n    for (let name of document.body.classList) {\n      alert(name); // main, and then page\n    }\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\n## Element style\n\nThe property `elem.style` is an object that corresponds to what's written in the `\"style\"` attribute. Setting `elem.style.width=\"100px\"` works the same as if we had in the attribute `style` a string `width:100px`.\n\nFor multi-word property the camelCase is used:\n\n```js no-beautify\nbackground-color  => elem.style.backgroundColor\nz-index           => elem.style.zIndex\nborder-left-width => elem.style.borderLeftWidth\n```\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\ndocument.body.style.backgroundColor = prompt('background color?', 'green');\n```\n\n````smart header=\"Prefixed properties\"\nBrowser-prefixed properties like `-moz-border-radius`, `-webkit-border-radius` also follow the same rule: a dash means upper case.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js\nbutton.style.MozBorderRadius = '5px';\nbutton.style.WebkitBorderRadius = '5px';\n```\n````\n\n## Resetting the style property\n\nSometimes we want to assign a style property, and later remove it.\n\nFor instance, to hide an element, we can set `elem.style.display = \"none\"`.\n\nThen later we may want to remove the `style.display` as if it were not set. Instead of `delete elem.style.display` we should assign an empty string to it: `elem.style.display = \"\"`.\n\n```js run\n// if we run this code, the <body> will blink\ndocument.body.style.display = \"none\"; // hide\n\nsetTimeout(() => document.body.style.display = \"\", 1000); // back to normal\n```\n\nIf we set `style.display` to an empty string, then the browser applies CSS classes and its built-in styles normally, as if there were no such `style.display` property at all.\n\n````smart header=\"Full rewrite with `style.cssText`\"\nNormally, we use `style.*` to assign individual style properties. We can't set the full style like `div.style=\"color: red; width: 100px\"`, because `div.style` is an object, and it's read-only.\n\nTo set the full style as a string, there's a special property `style.cssText`:\n\n```html run\n<div id=\"div\">Button</div>\n\n<script>\n  // we can set special style flags like \"important\" here\n  div.style.cssText=`color: red !important;\n    background-color: yellow;\n    width: 100px;\n    text-align: center;\n  `;\n\n  alert(div.style.cssText);\n</script>\n```\n\nThis property is rarely used, because such assignment removes all existing styles: it does not add, but replaces them. May occasionally delete something needed. But we can safely use it for new elements, when we know we won't delete an existing style.\n\nThe same can be accomplished by setting an attribute: `div.setAttribute('style', 'color: red...')`.\n````\n\n## Mind the units\n\nDon't forget to add CSS units to values.\n\nFor instance, we should not set `elem.style.top` to `10`, but rather to `10px`. Otherwise it wouldn't work:\n\n```html run height=100\n<body>\n  <script>\n  *!*\n    // doesn't work!\n    document.body.style.margin = 20;\n    alert(document.body.style.margin); // '' (empty string, the assignment is ignored)\n  */!*\n\n    // now add the CSS unit (px) - and it works\n    document.body.style.margin = '20px';\n    alert(document.body.style.margin); // 20px\n\n    alert(document.body.style.marginTop); // 20px\n    alert(document.body.style.marginLeft); // 20px\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\nPlease note: the browser \"unpacks\" the property `style.margin` in the last lines and infers `style.marginLeft` and `style.marginTop` from it.\n\n## Computed styles: getComputedStyle\n\nSo, modifying a style is easy. But how to *read* it?\n\nFor instance, we want to know the size, margins, the color of an element. How to do it?\n\n**The `style` property operates only on the value of the `\"style\"` attribute, without any CSS cascade.**\n\nSo we can't read anything that comes from CSS classes using `elem.style`.\n\nFor instance, here `style` doesn't see the margin:\n\n```html run height=60 no-beautify\n<head>\n  <style> body { color: red; margin: 5px } </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n  The red text\n  <script>\n*!*\n    alert(document.body.style.color); // empty\n    alert(document.body.style.marginTop); // empty\n*/!*\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\n...But what if we need, say, to increase the margin by `20px`? We would want the current value of it.\n\nThere's another method for that: `getComputedStyle`.\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\ngetComputedStyle(element, [pseudo])\n```\n\nelement\n: Element to read the value for.\n\npseudo\n: A pseudo-element if required, for instance `::before`. An empty string or no argument means the element itself.\n\nThe result is an object with styles, like `elem.style`, but now with respect to all CSS classes.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run height=100\n<head>\n  <style> body { color: red; margin: 5px } </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n  <script>\n    let computedStyle = getComputedStyle(document.body);\n\n    // now we can read the margin and the color from it\n\n    alert( computedStyle.marginTop ); // 5px\n    alert( computedStyle.color ); // rgb(255, 0, 0)\n  </script>\n\n</body>\n```\n\n```smart header=\"Computed and resolved values\"\nThere are two concepts in [CSS](https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/#resolved-values):\n\n1. A *computed* style value is the value after all CSS rules and CSS inheritance is applied, as the result of the CSS cascade. It can look like `height:1em` or `font-size:125%`.\n2. A *resolved* style value is the one finally applied to the element. Values like `1em` or `125%` are relative. The browser takes the computed value and makes all units fixed and absolute, for instance: `height:20px` or `font-size:16px`. For geometry properties resolved values may have a floating point, like `width:50.5px`.\n\nA long time ago `getComputedStyle` was created to get computed values, but it turned out that resolved values are much more convenient, and the standard changed.\n\nSo nowadays `getComputedStyle` actually returns the resolved value of the property, usually in `px` for geometry.\n```\n\n````warn header=\"`getComputedStyle` requires the full property name\"\nWe should always ask for the exact property that we want, like `paddingLeft` or `marginTop` or `borderTopWidth`. Otherwise the correct result is not guaranteed.\n\nFor instance, if there are properties `paddingLeft/paddingTop`, then what should we get for `getComputedStyle(elem).padding`? Nothing, or maybe a \"generated\" value from known paddings? There's no standard rule here.\n\nThere are other inconsistencies. As an example, some browsers (Chrome) show `10px` in the document below, and some of them (Firefox) --  do not:\n\n```html run\n<style>\n  body {\n    margin: 10px;\n  }\n</style>\n<script>\n  let style = getComputedStyle(document.body);\n  alert(style.margin); // empty string in Firefox\n</script>\n```\n````\n\n```smart header=\"Styles applied to `:visited` links are hidden!\"\nVisited links may be colored using `:visited` CSS pseudoclass.\n\nBut `getComputedStyle` does not give access to that color, because otherwise an arbitrary page could find out whether the user visited a link by creating it on the page and checking the styles.\n\nJavaScript may not see the styles applied by `:visited`. And also, there's a limitation in CSS that forbids applying geometry-changing styles in `:visited`. That's to guarantee that there's no side way for an evil page to test if a link was visited and hence to break the privacy.\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nTo manage classes, there are two DOM properties:\n\n- `className` -- the string value, good to manage the whole set of classes.\n- `classList` -- the object with methods `add/remove/toggle/contains`, good for individual classes.\n\nTo change the styles:\n\n- The `style` property is an object with camelCased styles. Reading and writing to it has the same meaning as modifying individual properties in the `\"style\"` attribute. To see how to apply `important` and other rare stuff -- there's a list of methods at [MDN](mdn:api/CSSStyleDeclaration).\n\n- The `style.cssText` property corresponds to the whole `\"style\"` attribute, the full string of styles.\n\nTo read the resolved styles (with respect to all classes, after all CSS is applied and final values are calculated):\n\n- The `getComputedStyle(elem, [pseudo])` returns the style-like object with them.

        "content": "\n\nThere are many JavaScript properties that allow us to read information about element width, height and other geometry features.\n\nWe often need them when moving or positioning elements in JavaScript.\n\n## Sample element\n\nAs a sample element to demonstrate properties we'll use the one given below:\n\n```html no-beautify\n<div id=\"example\">\n  ...Text...\n</div>\n<style>\n  #example {\n    width: 300px;\n    height: 200px;\n    border: 25px solid #E8C48F;\n    padding: 20px;              \n    overflow: auto;             \n  }\n</style>\n```\n\nIt has the border, padding and scrolling. The full set of features. There are no margins, as they are not the part of the element itself, and there are no special properties for them.\n\nThe element looks like this:\n\n![](metric-css.svg)\n\nYou can [open the document in the sandbox](sandbox:metric).\n\n```smart header=\"Mind the scrollbar\"\nThe picture above demonstrates the most complex case when the element has a scrollbar. Some browsers (not all) reserve the space for it by taking it from the content (labeled as \"content width\" above).\n\nSo, without scrollbar the content width would be `300px`, but if the scrollbar is `16px` wide (the width may vary between devices and browsers) then only `300 - 16 = 284px` remains, and we should take it into account. That's why examples from this chapter assume that there's a scrollbar. Without it, some calculations are simpler.\n```\n\n```smart header=\"The `padding-bottom` area may be filled with text\"\nUsually paddings are shown empty on our illustrations, but if there's a lot of text in the element and it overflows, then browsers show the \"overflowing\" text at `padding-bottom`, that's normal.\n```\n\n## Geometry\n\nHere's the overall picture with geometry properties:\n\n![](metric-all.svg)\n\nValues of these properties are technically numbers, but these numbers are \"of pixels\", so these are pixel measurements.\n\nLet's start exploring the properties starting from the outside of the element.\n\n## offsetParent, offsetLeft/Top\n\nThese properties are rarely needed, but still they are the \"most outer\" geometry properties, so we'll start with them.\n\nThe `offsetParent` is the nearest ancestor that the browser uses for calculating coordinates during rendering.\n\nThat's the nearest ancestor that is one of the following:\n\n1. CSS-positioned (`position` is `absolute`, `relative`, `fixed` or `sticky`),  or\n2. `<td>`, `<th>`, or `<table>`,  or\n3. `<body>`.\n\nProperties `offsetLeft/offsetTop` provide x/y coordinates relative to `offsetParent` upper-left corner.\n\nIn the example below the inner `<div>` has `<main>` as `offsetParent` and `offsetLeft/offsetTop` shifts from its upper-left corner (`180`):\n\n```html run height=10\n<main style=\"position: relative\" id=\"main\">\n  <article>\n    <div id=\"example\" style=\"position: absolute; left: 180px; top: 180px\">...</div>\n  </article>\n</main>\n<script>\n  alert(example.offsetParent.id); // main\n  alert(example.offsetLeft); // 180 (note: a number, not a string \"180px\")\n  alert(example.offsetTop); // 180\n</script>\n```\n\n![](metric-offset-parent.svg)\n\nThere are several occasions when `offsetParent` is `null`:\n\n1. For not shown elements (`display:none` or not in the document).\n2. For `<body>` and `<html>`.\n3. For elements with `position:fixed`.\n\n## offsetWidth/Height\n\nNow let's move on to the element itself.\n\nThese two properties are the simplest ones. They provide the \"outer\" width/height of the element. Or, in other words, its full size including borders.\n\n![](metric-offset-width-height.svg)\n\nFor our sample element:\n\n- `offsetWidth = 390` -- the outer width, can be calculated as inner CSS-width (`300px`) plus paddings (`2 * 20px`) and borders (`2 * 25px`).\n- `offsetHeight = 290` -- the outer height.\n\n````smart header=\"Geometry properties are zero/null for elements that are not displayed\"\nGeometry properties are calculated only for displayed elements.\n\nIf an element (or any of its ancestors) has `display:none` or is not in the document, then all geometry properties are zero (or `null` for `offsetParent`).\n\nFor example, `offsetParent` is `null`, and `offsetWidth`, `offsetHeight` are `0` when we created an element, but haven't inserted it into the document yet, or it (or it's ancestor) has `display:none`.\n\nWe can use this to check if an element is hidden, like this:\n\n```js\nfunction isHidden(elem) {\n  return !elem.offsetWidth && !elem.offsetHeight;\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that such `isHidden` returns `true` for elements that are on-screen, but have zero sizes (like an empty `<div>`).\n````\n\n## clientTop/Left\n\nInside the element we have the borders.\n\nTo measure them, there are properties `clientTop` and `clientLeft`.\n\nIn our example:\n\n- `clientLeft = 25` -- left border width\n- `clientTop = 25` -- top border width\n\n![](metric-client-left-top.svg)\n\n...But to be precise -- these properties are not border width/height, but rather relative coordinates of the inner side from the outer side.\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nIt becomes visible when the document is right-to-left (the operating system is in Arabic or Hebrew languages). The scrollbar is then not on the right, but on the left, and then `clientLeft` also includes the scrollbar width.\n\nIn that case, `clientLeft` would be not `25`, but with the scrollbar width `25 + 16 = 41`.\n\nHere's the example in hebrew:\n\n![](metric-client-left-top-rtl.svg)\n\n## clientWidth/Height\n\nThese properties provide the size of the area inside the element borders.\n\nThey include the content width together with paddings, but without the scrollbar:\n\n![](metric-client-width-height.svg)\n\nOn the picture above let's first consider `clientHeight`.\n\nThere's no horizontal scrollbar, so it's exactly the sum of what's inside the borders: CSS-height `200px` plus top and bottom paddings (`2 * 20px`) total `240px`.\n\nNow `clientWidth` -- here the content width is not `300px`, but `284px`, because `16px` are occupied by the scrollbar. So the sum is `284px` plus left and right paddings, total `324px`.\n\n**If there are no paddings, then `clientWidth/Height` is exactly the content area, inside the borders and the scrollbar (if any).**\n\n![](metric-client-width-nopadding.svg)\n\nSo when there's no padding we can use `clientWidth/clientHeight` to get the content area size.\n\n## scrollWidth/Height\n\nThese properties are like `clientWidth/clientHeight`, but they also include the scrolled out (hidden) parts:\n\n![](metric-scroll-width-height.svg)\n\nOn the picture above:\n\n- `scrollHeight = 723` -- is the full inner height of the content area including the scrolled out parts.\n- `scrollWidth = 324` -- is the full inner width, here we have no horizontal scroll, so it equals `clientWidth`.\n\nWe can use these properties to expand the element wide to its full width/height.\n\nLike this:\n\n```js\n// expand the element to the full content height\nelement.style.height = `${element.scrollHeight}px`;\n```\n\n```online\nClick the button to expand the element:\n\n<div id=\"element\" style=\"width:300px;height:200px; padding: 0;overflow: auto; border:1px solid black;\">text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text</div>\n\n<button style=\"padding:0\" onclick=\"element.style.height = `${element.scrollHeight}px`\">element.style.height = `${element.scrollHeight}px`</button>\n```\n\n## scrollLeft/scrollTop\n\nProperties `scrollLeft/scrollTop` are the width/height of the hidden, scrolled out part of the element.\n\nOn the picture below we can see `scrollHeight` and `scrollTop` for a block with a vertical scroll.\n\n![](metric-scroll-top.svg)\n\nIn other words, `scrollTop` is \"how much is scrolled up\".\n\n````smart header=\"`scrollLeft/scrollTop` can be modified\"\nMost of the geometry properties here are read-only, but `scrollLeft/scrollTop` can be changed, and the browser will scroll the element.\n\n```online\nIf you click the element below, the code `elem.scrollTop += 10` executes. That makes the element content scroll `10px` down.\n\n<div onclick=\"this.scrollTop+=10\" style=\"cursor:pointer;border:1px solid black;width:100px;height:80px;overflow:auto\">Click<br>Me<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9</div>\n```\n\nSetting `scrollTop` to `0` or a big value, such as `1e9` will make the element scroll to the very top/bottom respectively.\n````\n\n## Don't take width/height from CSS\n\nWe've just covered geometry properties of DOM elements, that can be used to get widths, heights and calculate distances.\n\nBut as we know from the chapter <info:styles-and-classes>, we can read CSS-height and width using `getComputedStyle`.\n\nSo why not to read the width of an element with `getComputedStyle`, like this?\n\n```js run\nlet elem = document.body;\n\nalert( getComputedStyle(elem).width ); // show CSS width for elem\n```\n\nWhy should we use geometry properties instead? There are two reasons:\n\n1. First, CSS `width/height` depend on another property: `box-sizing` that defines \"what is\" CSS width and height. A change in `box-sizing` for CSS purposes may break such JavaScript.\n2. Second, CSS `width/height` may be `auto`, for instance for an inline element:\n\n    ```html run\n    <span id=\"elem\">Hello!</span>\n\n    <script>\n    *!*\n      alert( getComputedStyle(elem).width ); // auto\n    */!*\n    </script>\n    ```\n\n    From the CSS standpoint, `width:auto` is perfectly normal, but in JavaScript we need an exact size in `px` that we can use in calculations. So here CSS width is useless.\n\nAnd there's one more reason: a scrollbar. Sometimes the code that works fine without a scrollbar becomes buggy with it, because a scrollbar takes the space from the content in some browsers. So the real width available for the content is *less* than CSS width. And `clientWidth/clientHeight` take that into account.\n\n...But with `getComputedStyle(elem).width` the situation is different. Some browsers (e.g. Chrome) return the real inner width, minus the scrollbar, and some of them (e.g. Firefox) -- CSS width (ignore the scrollbar). Such cross-browser differences is the reason not to use `getComputedStyle`, but rather rely on geometry properties.\n\n```online\nIf your browser reserves the space for a scrollbar (most browsers for Windows do), then you can test it below.\n\n[iframe src=\"cssWidthScroll\" link border=1]\n\nThe element with text has CSS `width:300px`.\n\nOn a Desktop Windows OS, Firefox, Chrome, Edge all reserve the space for the scrollbar. But  Firefox shows `300px`, while Chrome and Edge show less. That's because Firefox returns the CSS width and other browsers return the \"real\" width.\n```\n\nPlease note that the described difference is only about reading `getComputedStyle(...).width` from JavaScript, visually everything is correct.\n\n## Summary\n\nElements have the following geometry properties:\n\n- `offsetParent` -- is the nearest positioned ancestor or `td`, `th`, `table`, `body`.\n- `offsetLeft/offsetTop` -- coordinates relative to the upper-left edge of `offsetParent`.\n- `offsetWidth/offsetHeight` -- \"outer\" width/height of an element including borders.\n- `clientLeft/clientTop` -- the distances from the upper-left outer corner to the upper-left inner (content + padding) corner. For left-to-right OS they are always the widths of left/top borders. For right-to-left OS the vertical scrollbar is on the left so `clientLeft` includes its width too.\n- `clientWidth/clientHeight` -- the width/height of the content including paddings, but without the scrollbar.\n- `scrollWidth/scrollHeight` -- the width/height of the content, just like `clientWidth/clientHeight`, but also include scrolled-out, invisible part of the element.\n- `scrollLeft/scrollTop` -- width/height of the scrolled out upper part of the element, starting from its upper-left corner.\n\nAll properties are read-only except `scrollLeft/scrollTop` that make the browser scroll the element if changed.",

        "content": "\n\nHow do we find the width and height of the browser window? How do we get the full width and height of the document, including the scrolled out part? How do we scroll the page using JavaScript?\n\nFor most such requests, we can use the root document element `document.documentElement`, that corresponds to the `<html>` tag. But there are additional methods and peculiarities important enough to consider.\n\n## Width/height of the window\n\nTo get window width and height we can use `clientWidth/clientHeight` of `document.documentElement`:\n\n![](document-client-width-height.svg)\n\n```online\nFor instance, this button shows the height of your window:\n\n<button onclick=\"alert(document.documentElement.clientHeight)\">alert(document.documentElement.clientHeight)</button>\n```\n\n````warn header=\"Not `window.innerWidth/Height`\"\nBrowsers also support properties `window.innerWidth/innerHeight`. They look like what we want. So why not to use them instead?\n\nIf there exists a scrollbar, and it occupies some space, `clientWidth/clientHeight` provide the width/height without it (subtract it). In other words, they return width/height of the visible part of the document, available for the content.\n\n...And `window.innerWidth/innerHeight` include the scrollbar.\n\nIf there's a scrollbar, and it occupies some space, then these two lines show different values:\n```js run\nalert( window.innerWidth ); // full window width\nalert( document.documentElement.clientWidth ); // window width minus the scrollbar\n```\n\nIn most cases we need the *available* window width: to draw or position something. That is: inside scrollbars if there are any. So we should use `documentElement.clientHeight/Width`.\n````\n\n```warn header=\"`DOCTYPE` is important\"\nPlease note: top-level geometry properties may work a little bit differently when there's no `<!DOCTYPE HTML>` in HTML. Odd things are possible.\n\nIn modern HTML we should always write `DOCTYPE`.\n```\n\n## Width/height of the document\n\nTheoretically, as the root document element is `document.documentElement`, and it encloses all the content, we could measure document full size as `document.documentElement.scrollWidth/scrollHeight`.\n\nBut on that element, for the whole page, these properties do not work as intended. In Chrome/Safari/Opera if there's no scroll, then `documentElement.scrollHeight` may be even less than  `documentElement.clientHeight`! Sounds like a nonsense, weird, right?\n\nTo reliably obtain the full document height, we should take the maximum of these properties:\n\n```js run\nlet scrollHeight = Math.max(\n  document.body.scrollHeight, document.documentElement.scrollHeight,\n  document.body.offsetHeight, document.documentElement.offsetHeight,\n  document.body.clientHeight, document.documentElement.clientHeight\n);\n\nalert('Full document height, with scrolled out part: ' + scrollHeight);\n```\n\nWhy so? Better don't ask. These inconsistencies come from ancient times, not a \"smart\" logic.\n\n## Get the current scroll [#page-scroll]\n\nDOM elements have their current scroll state in `elem.scrollLeft/scrollTop`.\n\nFor document scroll `document.documentElement.scrollLeft/Top` works in most browsers, except older WebKit-based ones, like Safari (bug [5991](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5991)), where we should use `document.body` instead of `document.documentElement`.\n\nLuckily, we don't have to remember these peculiarities at all, because the scroll is available in the special properties `window.pageXOffset/pageYOffset`:\n\n```js run\nalert('Current scroll from the top: ' + window.pageYOffset);\nalert('Current scroll from the left: ' + window.pageXOffset);\n```\n\nThese properties are read-only.\n\n## Scrolling: scrollTo, scrollBy, scrollIntoView [#window-scroll]\n\n```warn\nTo scroll the page from JavaScript, its DOM must be fully built.\n\nFor instance, if we try to scroll the page from the script in `<head>`, it won't work.\n```\n\nRegular elements can be scrolled by changing `scrollTop/scrollLeft`.\n\nWe can do the same for the page using `document.documentElement.scrollTop/Left` (except Safari, where `document.body.scrollTop/Left` should be used instead).\n\nAlternatively, there's a simpler, universal solution: special methods  [window.scrollBy(x,y)](mdn:api/Window/scrollBy) and [window.scrollTo(pageX,pageY)](mdn:api/Window/scrollTo).\n\n- The method `scrollBy(x,y)` scrolls the page *relative to its current position*. For instance, `scrollBy(0,10)` scrolls the page `10px` down.\n\n    ```online\n    The button below demonstrates this:\n\n    <button onclick=\"window.scrollBy(0,10)\">window.scrollBy(0,10)</button>\n    ```\n- The method `scrollTo(pageX,pageY)` scrolls the page *to absolute coordinates*, so that the top-left corner of the visible part has coordinates `(pageX, pageY)` relative to the document's top-left corner. It's like setting `scrollLeft/scrollTop`.\n\n    To scroll to the very beginning, we can use `scrollTo(0,0)`.\n\n    ```online\n    <button onclick=\"window.scrollTo(0,0)\">window.scrollTo(0,0)</button>\n    ```\n\nThese methods work for all browsers the same way.\n\n## scrollIntoView\n\nFor completeness, let's cover one more method:  [elem.scrollIntoView(top)](mdn:api/Element/scrollIntoView).\n\nThe call to `elem.scrollIntoView(top)` scrolls the page to make `elem` visible. It has one argument:\n\n- if `top=true` (that's the default), then the page will be scrolled to make `elem` appear on the top of the window. The upper edge of the element is aligned with the window top.\n- if `top=false`, then the page scrolls to make `elem` appear at the bottom. The bottom edge of the element is aligned with the window bottom.\n\n```online\nThe button below scrolls the page to make itself show at the window top:\n\n<button onclick=\"this.scrollIntoView()\">this.scrollIntoView()</button>\n\nAnd this button scrolls the page to show it at the bottom:\n\n<button onclick=\"this.scrollIntoView(false)\">this.scrollIntoView(false)</button>\n```\n\n## Forbid the scrolling\n\nSometimes we need to make the document \"unscrollable\". For instance, when we need to cover it with a large message requiring immediate attention, and we want the visitor to interact with that message, not with the document.\n\nTo make the document unscrollable, it's enough to set `document.body.style.overflow = \"hidden\"`. The page will freeze on its current scroll.\n\n```online\nTry it:\n\n<button onclick=\"document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden'\">document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden'</button>\n\n<button onclick=\"document.body.style.overflow = ''\">document.body.style.overflow = ''</button>\n\nThe first button freezes the scroll, the second one resumes it.\n```\n\nWe can use the same technique to \"freeze\" the scroll for other elements, not just for `document.body`.\n\nThe drawback of the method is that the scrollbar disappears. If it occupied some space, then that space is now free, and the content \"jumps\" to fill it.\n\nThat looks a bit odd, but can be worked around if we compare `clientWidth` before and after the freeze, and if it increased (the scrollbar disappeared) then add `padding` to `document.body` in place of the scrollbar, to keep the content width the same.\n\n## Summary\n\nGeometry:\n\n- Width/height of the visible part of the document (content area width/height): `document.documentElement.clientWidth/Height`\n- Width/height of the whole document, with the scrolled out part:\n\n    ```js\n    let scrollHeight = Math.max(\n      document.body.scrollHeight, document.documentElement.scrollHeight,\n      document.body.offsetHeight, document.documentElement.offsetHeight,\n      document.body.clientHeight, document.documentElement.clientHeight\n    );\n    ```\n\nScrolling:\n\n- Read the current scroll: `window.pageYOffset/pageXOffset`.\n- Change the current scroll:\n\n    - `window.scrollTo(pageX,pageY)` -- absolute coordinates,\n    - `window.scrollBy(x,y)` -- scroll relative the current place,\n    - `elem.scrollIntoView(top)` -- scroll to make `elem` visible (align with the top/bottom of the window).",

        "content": "\n\nTo move elements around we should be familiar with coordinates.\n\nMost JavaScript methods deal with one of two coordinate systems:\n\n1. **Relative to the window** - similar to `position:fixed`, calculated from the window top/left edge.\n    - we'll denote these coordinates as `clientX/clientY`, the reasoning for such name will become clear later, when we study event properties.\n2. **Relative to the document** - similar to `position:absolute` in the document root, calculated from the document top/left edge.\n    - we'll denote them `pageX/pageY`.\n\nWhen the page is scrolled to the very beginning, so that the top/left corner of the window is exactly the document top/left corner, these coordinates equal each other. But after the document shifts, window-relative coordinates of elements change, as elements move across the window, while document-relative coordinates remain the same.\n\nOn this picture we take a point in the document and demonstrate its coordinates before the scroll (left) and after it (right):\n\n![](document-and-window-coordinates-scrolled.svg)\n\nWhen the document scrolled:\n- `pageY` - document-relative coordinate stayed the same, it's counted from the document top (now scrolled out).\n- `clientY` - window-relative coordinate did change (the arrow became shorter), as the same point became closer to window top.\n\n## Element coordinates: getBoundingClientRect\n\nThe method `elem.getBoundingClientRect()` returns window coordinates for a minimal rectangle that encloses `elem` as an object of built-in [DOMRect](https://www.w3.org/TR/geometry-1/#domrect) class.\n\nMain `DOMRect` properties:\n\n- `x/y` -- X/Y-coordinates of the rectangle origin relative to window,\n- `width/height` -- width/height of the rectangle (can be negative).\n\nAdditionally, there are derived properties:\n\n- `top/bottom` -- Y-coordinate for the top/bottom rectangle edge,\n- `left/right` -- X-coordinate for the left/right rectangle edge.\n\n```online\nFor instance click this button to see its window coordinates:\n\n<p><input id=\"brTest\" type=\"button\" value=\"Get coordinates using button.getBoundingClientRect() for this button\" onclick='showRect(this)'/></p>\n\n<script>\nfunction showRect(elem) {\n  let r = elem.getBoundingClientRect();\n  alert(`x:${r.x}\ny:${r.y}\nwidth:${r.width}\nheight:${r.height}\ntop:${r.top}\nbottom:${r.bottom}\nleft:${r.left}\nright:${r.right}\n`);\n}\n</script>\n\nIf you scroll the page and repeat, you'll notice that as window-relative button position changes, its window coordinates (`y/top/bottom` if you scroll vertically) change as well.\n```\n\nHere's the picture of `elem.getBoundingClientRect()` output:\n\n![](coordinates.svg)\n\nAs you can see, `x/y` and `width/height` fully describe the rectangle. Derived properties can be easily calculated from them:\n\n- `left = x`\n- `top = y`\n- `right = x + width`\n- `bottom = y + height`\n\nPlease note:\n\n- Coordinates may be decimal fractions, such as `10.5`. That's normal, internally browser uses fractions in calculations. We don't have to round them when setting to `style.left/top`.\n- Coordinates may be negative. For instance, if the page is scrolled so that `elem` is now above the window, then `elem.getBoundingClientRect().top` is negative.\n\n```smart header=\"Why derived properties are needed? Why does `top/left` exist if there's `x/y`?\"\nMathematically, a rectangle is uniquely defined with its starting point `(x,y)` and the direction vector `(width,height)`. So the additional derived properties are for convenience.\n\nTechnically it's possible for `width/height` to be negative, that allows for \"directed\" rectangle, e.g. to represent mouse selection with properly marked start and end.\n\nNegative `width/height` values mean that the rectangle starts at its bottom-right corner and then \"grows\" left-upwards.\n\nHere's a rectangle with negative `width` and `height` (e.g. `width=-200`, `height=-100`):\n\n![](coordinates-negative.svg)\n\nAs you can see, `left/top` do not equal `x/y` in such case.\n\nIn practice though, `elem.getBoundingClientRect()` always returns positive width/height, here we mention negative `width/height` only for you to understand why these seemingly duplicate properties are not actually duplicates.\n```\n\n```warn header=\"Internet Explorer and Edge: no support for `x/y`\"\nInternet Explorer and Edge don't support `x/y` properties for historical reasons.\n\nSo we can either make a polyfill (add getters in `DomRect.prototype`) or just use `top/left`, as they are always the same as `x/y` for positive `width/height`, in particular in the result of `elem.getBoundingClientRect()`.\n```\n\n```warn header=\"Coordinates right/bottom are different from CSS position properties\"\nThere are obvious similarities between window-relative coordinates and CSS `position:fixed`.\n\nBut in CSS positioning, `right` property means the distance from the right edge, and `bottom` property means the distance from the bottom edge.\n\nIf we just look at the picture above, we can see that in JavaScript it is not so. All window coordinates are counted from the top-left corner, including these ones.\n```\n\n## elementFromPoint(x, y) [#elementFromPoint]\n\nThe call to `document.elementFromPoint(x, y)` returns the most nested element at window coordinates `(x, y)`.\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\nlet elem = document.elementFromPoint(x, y);\n```\n\nFor instance, the code below highlights and outputs the tag of the element that is now in the middle of the window:\n\n```js run\nlet centerX = document.documentElement.clientWidth / 2;\nlet centerY = document.documentElement.clientHeight / 2;\n\nlet elem = document.elementFromPoint(centerX, centerY);\n\nelem.style.background = \"red\";\nalert(elem.tagName);\n```\n\nAs it uses window coordinates, the element may be different depending on the current scroll position.\n\n````warn header=\"For out-of-window coordinates the `elementFromPoint` returns `null`\"\nThe method `document.elementFromPoint(x,y)` only works if `(x,y)` are inside the visible area.\n\nIf any of the coordinates is negative or exceeds the window width/height, then it returns `null`.\n\nHere's a typical error that may occur if we don't check for it:\n\n```js\nlet elem = document.elementFromPoint(x, y);\n// if the coordinates happen to be out of the window, then elem = null\n*!*\nelem.style.background = ''; // Error!\n*/!*\n```\n````\n\n## Using for \"fixed\" positioning\n\nMost of time we need coordinates in order to position something.\n\nTo show something near an element, we can use `getBoundingClientRect` to get its coordinates, and then CSS `position` together with `left/top` (or `right/bottom`).\n\nFor instance, the function `createMessageUnder(elem, html)` below shows the message under `elem`:\n\n```js\nlet elem = document.getElementById(\"coords-show-mark\");\n\nfunction createMessageUnder(elem, html) {\n  // create message element\n  let message = document.createElement('div');\n  // better to use a css class for the style here\n  message.style.cssText = \"position:fixed; color: red\";\n\n*!*\n  // assign coordinates, don't forget \"px\"!\n  let coords = elem.getBoundingClientRect();\n\n  message.style.left = coords.left + \"px\";\n  message.style.top = coords.bottom + \"px\";\n*/!*\n\n  message.innerHTML = html;\n\n  return message;\n}\n\n// Usage:\n// add it for 5 seconds in the document\nlet message = createMessageUnder(elem, 'Hello, world!');\ndocument.body.append(message);\nsetTimeout(() => message.remove(), 5000);\n```\n\n```online\nClick the button to run it:\n\n<button id=\"coords-show-mark\">Button with id=\"coords-show-mark\", the message will appear under it</button>\n```\n\nThe code can be modified to show the message at the left, right, below, apply CSS animations to \"fade it in\" and so on. That's easy, as we have all the coordinates and sizes of the element.\n\nBut note the important detail: when the page is scrolled, the message flows away from the button.\n\nThe reason is obvious: the message element relies on `position:fixed`, so it remains at the same place of the window while the page scrolls away.\n\nTo change that, we need to use document-based coordinates and `position:absolute`.\n\n## Document coordinates [#getCoords]\n\nDocument-relative coordinates start from the upper-left corner of the document, not the window.\n\nIn CSS, window coordinates correspond to `position:fixed`, while document coordinates are similar to `position:absolute` on top.\n\nWe can use `position:absolute` and `top/left` to put something at a certain place of the document, so that it remains there during a page scroll. But we need the right coordinates first.\n\nThere's no standard method to get the document coordinates of an element. But it's easy to write it.\n\nThe two coordinate systems are connected by the formula:\n- `pageY` = `clientY` + height of the scrolled-out vertical part of the document.\n- `pageX` = `clientX` + width of the scrolled-out horizontal part of the document.\n\nThe function `getCoords(elem)` will take window coordinates from `elem.getBoundingClientRect()` and add the current scroll to them:\n\n```js\n// get document coordinates of the element\nfunction getCoords(elem) {\n  let box = elem.getBoundingClientRect();\n\n  return {\n    top: box.top + window.pageYOffset,\n    left: box.left + window.pageXOffset\n  };\n}\n```\n\nIf in the example above we used it with `position:absolute`, then the message would stay near the element on scroll.\n\nThe modified `createMessageUnder` function:\n\n```js\nfunction createMessageUnder(elem, html) {\n  let message = document.createElement('div');\n  message.style.cssText = \"*!*position:absolute*/!*; color: red\";\n\n  let coords = *!*getCoords(elem);*/!*\n\n  message.style.left = coords.left + \"px\";\n  message.style.top = coords.bottom + \"px\";\n\n  message.innerHTML = html;\n\n  return message;\n}\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nAny point on the page has coordinates:\n\n1. Relative to the window -- `elem.getBoundingClientRect()`.\n2. Relative to the document -- `elem.getBoundingClientRect()` plus the current page scroll.\n\nWindow coordinates are great to use with `position:fixed`, and document coordinates do well with `position:absolute`.\n\nBoth coordinate systems have their pros and cons; there are times we need one or the other one, just like CSS `position` `absolute` and `fixed`.",

        "content": "\n\n*An event* is a signal that something has happened. All DOM nodes generate such signals (but events are not limited to DOM).\n\nHere's a list of the most useful DOM events, just to take a look at:\n\n**Mouse events:**\n- `click` -- when the mouse clicks on an element (touchscreen devices generate it on a tap).\n- `contextmenu` -- when the mouse right-clicks on an element.\n- `mouseover` / `mouseout` -- when the mouse cursor comes over / leaves an element.\n- `mousedown` / `mouseup` -- when the mouse button is pressed / released over an element.\n- `mousemove` -- when the mouse is moved.\n\n**Keyboard events:**\n- `keydown` and `keyup` -- when a keyboard key is pressed and released.\n\n**Form element events:**\n- `submit` -- when the visitor submits a `<form>`.\n- `focus` --  when the visitor focuses on an element, e.g. on an `<input>`.\n\n**Document events:**\n- `DOMContentLoaded` -- when the HTML is loaded and processed, DOM is fully built.\n\n**CSS events:**\n- `transitionend` -- when a CSS-animation finishes.\n\nThere are many other events. We'll get into more details of particular events in next chapters.\n\n## Event handlers\n\nTo react on events we can assign a *handler* -- a function that runs in case of an event.\n\nHandlers are a way to run JavaScript code in case of user actions.\n\nThere are several ways to assign a handler. Let's see them, starting from the simplest one.\n\n### HTML-attribute\n\nA handler can be set in HTML with an attribute named `on<event>`.\n\nFor instance, to assign a `click` handler for an `input`, we can use `onclick`, like here:\n\n```html run\n<input value=\"Click me\" *!*onclick=\"alert('Click!')\"*/!* type=\"button\">\n```\n\nOn mouse click, the code inside `onclick` runs.\n\nPlease note that inside `onclick` we use single quotes, because the attribute itself is in double quotes. If we forget that the code is inside the attribute and use double quotes inside, like this:  `onclick=\"alert(\"Click!\")\"`, then it won't work right.\n\nAn HTML-attribute is not a convenient place to write a lot of code, so we'd better create a JavaScript function and call it there.\n\nHere a click runs the function `countRabbits()`:\n\n```html autorun height=50\n<script>\n  function countRabbits() {\n    for(let i=1; i<=3; i++) {\n      alert(\"Rabbit number \" + i);\n    }\n  }\n</script>\n\n<input type=\"button\" *!*onclick=\"countRabbits()\"*/!* value=\"Count rabbits!\">\n```\n\nAs we know, HTML attribute names are not case-sensitive, so `ONCLICK` works as well as `onClick` and `onCLICK`... But usually attributes are lowercased: `onclick`.\n\n### DOM property\n\nWe can assign a handler using a DOM property `on<event>`.\n\nFor instance, `elem.onclick`:\n\n```html autorun\n<input id=\"elem\" type=\"button\" value=\"Click me\">\n<script>\n*!*\n  elem.onclick = function() {\n    alert('Thank you');\n  };\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\nIf the handler is assigned using an HTML-attribute then the browser reads it, creates a new function from the attribute content and writes it to the DOM property.\n\nSo this way is actually the same as the previous one.\n\nThese two code pieces work the same:\n\n1. Only HTML:\n\n    ```html autorun height=50\n    <input type=\"button\" *!*onclick=\"alert('Click!')\"*/!* value=\"Button\">\n    ```\n2. HTML + JS:\n\n    ```html autorun height=50\n    <input type=\"button\" id=\"button\" value=\"Button\">\n    <script>\n    *!*\n      button.onclick = function() {\n        alert('Click!');\n      };\n    */!*\n    </script>\n    ```\n\nIn the first example, the HTML attribute is used to initialize the `button.onclick`, while in the second example -- the script, that's all the difference.\n\n**As there's only one `onclick` property, we can't assign more than one event handler.**\n\nIn the example below adding a handler with JavaScript overwrites the existing handler:\n\n```html run height=50 autorun\n<input type=\"button\" id=\"elem\" onclick=\"alert('Before')\" value=\"Click me\">\n<script>\n*!*\n  elem.onclick = function() { // overwrites the existing handler\n    alert('After'); // only this will be shown\n  };\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\nTo remove a handler -- assign `elem.onclick = null`.\n\n## Accessing the element: this\n\nThe value of `this` inside a handler is the element. The one which has the handler on it.\n\nIn the code below `button` shows its contents using `this.innerHTML`:\n\n```html height=50 autorun\n<button onclick=\"alert(this.innerHTML)\">Click me</button>\n```\n\n## Possible mistakes\n\nIf you're starting to work with events -- please note some subtleties.\n\nWe can set an existing function as a handler:\n\n```js\nfunction sayThanks() {\n  alert('Thanks!');\n}\n\nelem.onclick = sayThanks;\n```\n\nBut be careful: the function should be assigned as `sayThanks`, not `sayThanks()`.\n\n```js\n// right\nbutton.onclick = sayThanks;\n\n// wrong\nbutton.onclick = sayThanks();\n```\n\nIf we add parentheses, then `sayThanks()` becomes is a function call. So the last line actually takes the *result* of the function execution, that is `undefined` (as the function returns nothing), and assigns it to `onclick`. That doesn't work.\n\n...On the other hand, in the markup we do need the parentheses:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"button\" id=\"button\" onclick=\"sayThanks()\">\n```\n\nThe difference is easy to explain. When the browser reads the attribute, it creates a handler function with body from the attribute content.\n\nSo the markup generates this property:\n```js\nbutton.onclick = function() {\n*!*\n  sayThanks(); // <-- the attribute content goes here\n*/!*\n};\n```\n\n**Don't use `setAttribute` for handlers.**\n\nSuch a call won't work:\n\n```js run no-beautify\n// a click on <body> will generate errors,\n// because attributes are always strings, function becomes a string\ndocument.body.setAttribute('onclick', function() { alert(1) });\n```\n\n**DOM-property case matters.**\n\nAssign a handler to `elem.onclick`, not `elem.ONCLICK`, because DOM properties are case-sensitive.\n\n## addEventListener\n\nThe fundamental problem of the aforementioned ways to assign handlers -- we can't assign multiple handlers to one event.\n\nLet's say, one part of our code wants to highlight a button on click, and another one wants to show a message on the same click.\n\nWe'd like to assign two event handlers for that. But a new DOM property will overwrite the existing one:\n\n```js no-beautify\ninput.onclick = function() { alert(1); }\n// ...\ninput.onclick = function() { alert(2); } // replaces the previous handler\n```\n\nDevelopers of web standards understood that long ago and suggested an alternative way of managing handlers using special methods `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener`. They are free of such a problem.\n\nThe syntax to add a handler:\n\n```js\nelement.addEventListener(event, handler, [options]);\n```\n\n`event`\n: Event name, e.g. `\"click\"`.\n\n`handler`\n: The handler function.\n\n`options`\n: An additional optional object with properties:\n    - `once`: if `true`, then the listener is automatically removed after it triggers.\n    - `capture`: the phase where to handle the event, to be covered later in the chapter <info:bubbling-and-capturing>. For historical reasons, `options` can also be `false/true`, that's the same as `{capture: false/true}`.\n    - `passive`: if `true`, then the handler will not call `preventDefault()`, we'll explain that later in <info:default-browser-action>.\n\nTo remove the handler, use `removeEventListener`:\n\n```js\nelement.removeEventListener(event, handler, [options]);\n```\n\n````warn header=\"Removal requires the same function\"\nTo remove a handler we should pass exactly the same function as was assigned.\n\nThat doesn't work:\n\n```js no-beautify\nelem.addEventListener( \"click\" , () => alert('Thanks!'));\n// ....\nelem.removeEventListener( \"click\", () => alert('Thanks!'));\n```\n\nThe handler won't be removed, because `removeEventListener` gets another function -- with the same code, but that doesn't matter, as it's a different function object.\n\nHere's the right way:\n\n```js\nfunction handler() {\n  alert( 'Thanks!' );\n}\n\ninput.addEventListener(\"click\", handler);\n// ....\ninput.removeEventListener(\"click\", handler);\n```\n\nPlease note -- if we don't store the function in a variable, then we can't remove it. There's no way to \"read back\" handlers assigned by `addEventListener`.\n````\n\nMultiple calls to `addEventListener` allow to add multiple handlers, like this:\n\n```html run no-beautify\n<input id=\"elem\" type=\"button\" value=\"Click me\"/>\n\n<script>\n  function handler1() {\n    alert('Thanks!');\n  };\n\n  function handler2() {\n    alert('Thanks again!');\n  }\n\n*!*\n  elem.onclick = () => alert(\"Hello\");\n  elem.addEventListener(\"click\", handler1); // Thanks!\n  elem.addEventListener(\"click\", handler2); // Thanks again!\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\nAs we can see in the example above, we can set handlers *both* using a DOM-property and `addEventListener`. But generally we use only one of these ways.\n\n````warn header=\"For some events, handlers only work with `addEventListener`\"\nThere exist events that can't be assigned via a DOM-property. Only with `addEventListener`.\n\nFor instance, the `DOMContentLoaded` event, that triggers when the document is loaded and DOM is built.\n\n```js\n// will never run\ndocument.onDOMContentLoaded = function() {\n  alert(\"DOM built\");\n};\n```\n\n```js\n// this way it works\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function() {\n  alert(\"DOM built\");\n});\n```\nSo `addEventListener` is more universal. Although, such events are an exception rather than the rule.\n````\n\n## Event object\n\nTo properly handle an event we'd want to know more about what's happened. Not just a \"click\" or a \"keydown\", but what were the pointer coordinates? Which key was pressed? And so on.\n\nWhen an event happens, the browser creates an *event object*, puts details into it and passes it as an argument to the handler.\n\nHere's an example of getting pointer coordinates from the event object:\n\n```html run\n<input type=\"button\" value=\"Click me\" id=\"elem\">\n\n<script>\n  elem.onclick = function(*!*event*/!*) {\n    // show event type, element and coordinates of the click\n    alert(event.type + \" at \" + event.currentTarget);\n    alert(\"Coordinates: \" + event.clientX + \":\" + event.clientY);\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\nSome properties of `event` object:\n\n`event.type`\n: Event type, here it's `\"click\"`.\n\n`event.currentTarget`\n: Element that handled the event. That's exactly the same as `this`, unless the handler is an arrow function, or its `this` is bound to something else, then we can get the element from  `event.currentTarget`.\n\n`event.clientX / event.clientY`\n: Window-relative coordinates of the cursor, for pointer events.\n\nThere are more properties. Many of them depend on the event type: keyboard events have one set of properties, pointer events - another one, we'll study them later when we come to different events in details.\n\n````smart header=\"The event object is also available in HTML handlers\"\nIf we assign a handler in HTML, we can also use the `event` object, like this:\n\n```html autorun height=60\n<input type=\"button\" onclick=\"*!*alert(event.type)*/!*\" value=\"Event type\">\n```\n\nThat's possible because when the browser reads the attribute, it creates a handler like this:  `function(event) { alert(event.type) }`. That is: its first argument is called `\"event\"`, and the body is taken from the attribute.\n````\n\n\n## Object handlers: handleEvent\n\nWe can assign not just a function, but an object as an event handler using `addEventListener`. When an event occurs, its `handleEvent` method is called.\n\nFor instance:\n\n\n```html run\n<button id=\"elem\">Click me</button>\n\n<script>\n  let obj = {\n    handleEvent(event) {\n      alert(event.type + \" at \" + event.currentTarget);\n    }\n  };\n\n  elem.addEventListener('click', obj);\n</script>\n```\n\nAs we can see, when `addEventListener` receives an object as the handler, it calls `obj.handleEvent(event)` in case of an event.\n\nWe could also use a class for that:\n\n\n```html run\n<button id=\"elem\">Click me</button>\n\n<script>\n  class Menu {\n    handleEvent(event) {\n      switch(event.type) {\n        case 'mousedown':\n          elem.innerHTML = \"Mouse button pressed\";\n          break;\n        case 'mouseup':\n          elem.innerHTML += \"...and released.\";\n          break;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n*!*\n  let menu = new Menu();\n  elem.addEventListener('mousedown', menu);\n  elem.addEventListener('mouseup', menu);\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\nHere the same object handles both events. Please note that we need to explicitly setup the events to listen using `addEventListener`. The `menu` object only gets `mousedown` and `mouseup` here, not any other types of events.\n\nThe method `handleEvent` does not have to do all the job by itself. It can call other event-specific methods instead, like this:\n\n```html run\n<button id=\"elem\">Click me</button>\n\n<script>\n  class Menu {\n    handleEvent(event) {\n      // mousedown -> onMousedown\n      let method = 'on' + event.type[0].toUpperCase() + event.type.slice(1);\n      this[method](event);\n    }\n\n    onMousedown() {\n      elem.innerHTML = \"Mouse button pressed\";\n    }\n\n    onMouseup() {\n      elem.innerHTML += \"...and released.\";\n    }\n  }\n\n  let menu = new Menu();\n  elem.addEventListener('mousedown', menu);\n  elem.addEventListener('mouseup', menu);\n</script>\n```\n\nNow event handlers are clearly separated, that may be easier to support.\n\n## Summary\n\nThere are 3 ways to assign event handlers:\n\n1. HTML attribute: `onclick=\"...\"`.\n2. DOM property: `elem.onclick = function`.\n3. Methods: `elem.addEventListener(event, handler[, phase])` to add, `removeEventListener` to remove.\n\nHTML attributes are used sparingly, because JavaScript in the middle of an HTML tag looks a little bit odd and alien. Also can't write lots of code in there.\n\nDOM properties are ok to use, but we can't assign more than one handler of the particular event. In many cases that limitation is not pressing.\n\nThe last way is the most flexible, but it is also the longest to write. There are few events that only work with it, for instance `transitionend` and `DOMContentLoaded` (to be covered). Also `addEventListener` supports objects as event handlers. In that case the method `handleEvent` is called in case of the event.\n\nNo matter how you assign the handler -- it gets an event object as the first argument. That object contains the details about what's happened.\n\nWe'll learn more about events in general and about different types of events in the next chapters.",

        "content": "\n\nLet's start with an example.\n\nThis handler is assigned to `<div>`, but also runs if you click any nested tag like `<em>` or `<code>`:\n\n```html autorun height=60\n<div onclick=\"alert('The handler!')\">\n  <em>If you click on <code>EM</code>, the handler on <code>DIV</code> runs.</em>\n</div>\n```\n\nIsn't it a bit strange? Why does the handler on `<div>` run if the actual click was on `<em>`?\n\n## Bubbling\n\nThe bubbling principle is simple.\n\n**When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.**\n\nLet's say we have 3 nested elements `FORM > DIV > P` with a handler on each of them:\n\n```html run autorun\n<style>\n  body * {\n    margin: 10px;\n    border: 1px solid blue;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<form onclick=\"alert('form')\">FORM\n  <div onclick=\"alert('div')\">DIV\n    <p onclick=\"alert('p')\">P</p>\n  </div>\n</form>\n```\n\nA click on the inner `<p>` first runs `onclick`:\n1. On that `<p>`.\n2. Then on the outer `<div>`.\n3. Then on the outer `<form>`.\n4. And so on upwards till the `document` object.\n\n![](event-order-bubbling.svg)\n\nSo if we click on `<p>`, then we'll see 3 alerts: `p` -> `div` -> `form`.\n\nThe process is called \"bubbling\", because events \"bubble\" from the inner element up through parents like a bubble in the water.\n\n```warn header=\"*Almost* all events bubble.\"\nThe key word in this phrase is \"almost\".\n\nFor instance, a `focus` event does not bubble. There are other examples too, we'll meet them. But still it's an exception, rather than a rule, most events do bubble.\n```\n\n## event.target\n\nA handler on a parent element can always get the details about where it actually happened.\n\n**The most deeply nested element that caused the event is called a *target* element, accessible as `event.target`.**\n\nNote the differences from `this` (=`event.currentTarget`):\n\n- `event.target` -- is the \"target\" element that initiated the event, it doesn't change through the bubbling process.\n- `this` -- is the \"current\" element, the one that has a currently running handler on it.\n\nFor instance, if we have a single handler `form.onclick`, then it can \"catch\" all clicks inside the form. No matter where the click happened, it bubbles up to `<form>` and runs the handler.\n\nIn `form.onclick` handler:\n\n- `this` (=`event.currentTarget`) is the `<form>` element, because the handler runs on it.\n- `event.target` is the actual element inside the form that was clicked.\n\nCheck it out:\n\n[codetabs height=220 src=\"bubble-target\"]\n\nIt's possible that `event.target` could equal `this` -- it happens when the click is made directly on the `<form>` element.\n\n## Stopping bubbling\n\nA bubbling event goes from the target element straight up. Normally it goes upwards till `<html>`, and then to `document` object, and some events even reach `window`, calling all handlers on the path.\n\nBut any handler may decide that the event has been fully processed and stop the bubbling.\n\nThe method for it is `event.stopPropagation()`.\n\nFor instance, here `body.onclick` doesn't work if you click on `<button>`:\n\n```html run autorun height=60\n<body onclick=\"alert(`the bubbling doesn't reach here`)\">\n  <button onclick=\"event.stopPropagation()\">Click me</button>\n</body>\n```\n\n```smart header=\"event.stopImmediatePropagation()\"\nIf an element has multiple event handlers on a single event, then even if one of them stops the bubbling, the other ones still execute.\n\nIn other words, `event.stopPropagation()` stops the move upwards, but on the current element all other handlers will run.\n\nTo stop the bubbling and prevent handlers on the current element from running, there's a method `event.stopImmediatePropagation()`. After it no other handlers execute.\n```\n\n```warn header=\"Don't stop bubbling without a need!\"\nBubbling is convenient. Don't stop it without a real need: obvious and architecturally well thought out.\n\nSometimes `event.stopPropagation()` creates hidden pitfalls that later may become problems.\n\nFor instance:\n\n1. We create a nested menu. Each submenu handles clicks on its elements and calls `stopPropagation` so that the outer menu won't trigger.\n2. Later we decide to catch clicks on the whole window, to track users' behavior (where people click). Some analytic systems do that. Usually the code uses `document.addEventListener('click'…)` to catch all clicks.\n3. Our analytic won't work over the area where clicks are stopped by `stopPropagation`. Sadly, we've got a \"dead zone\".\n\nThere's usually no real need to prevent the bubbling. A task that seemingly requires that may be solved by other means. One of them is to use custom events, we'll cover them later. Also we can write our data into the `event` object in one handler and read it in another one, so we can pass to handlers on parents information about the processing below.\n```\n\n\n## Capturing\n\nThere's another phase of event processing called \"capturing\". It is rarely used in real code, but sometimes can be useful.\n\nThe standard [DOM Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/) describes 3 phases of event propagation:\n\n1. Capturing phase -- the event goes down to the element.\n2. Target phase -- the event reached the target element.\n3. Bubbling phase -- the event bubbles up from the element.\n\nHere's the picture of a click on `<td>` inside a table, taken from the specification:\n\n![](eventflow.svg)\n\nThat is: for a click on `<td>` the event first goes through the ancestors chain down to the element (capturing phase), then it reaches the target and triggers there (target phase), and then it goes up (bubbling phase), calling handlers on its way.\n\n**Before we only talked about bubbling, because the capturing phase is rarely used. Normally it is invisible to us.**\n\nHandlers added using `on<event>`-property or using HTML attributes or using two-argument `addEventListener(event, handler)` don't know anything about capturing, they only run on the 2nd and 3rd phases.\n\nTo catch an event on the capturing phase, we need to set the handler `capture` option to `true`:\n\n```js\nelem.addEventListener(..., {capture: true})\n// or, just \"true\" is an alias to {capture: true}\nelem.addEventListener(..., true)\n```\n\nThere are two possible values of the `capture` option:\n\n- If it's `false` (default), then the handler is set on the bubbling phase.\n- If it's `true`, then the handler is set on the capturing phase.\n\n\nNote that while formally there are 3 phases, the 2nd phase (\"target phase\": the event reached the element) is not handled separately: handlers on both capturing and bubbling phases trigger at that phase.\n\nLet's see both capturing and bubbling in action:\n\n```html run autorun height=140 edit\n<style>\n  body * {\n    margin: 10px;\n    border: 1px solid blue;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<form>FORM\n  <div>DIV\n    <p>P</p>\n  </div>\n</form>\n\n<script>\n  for(let elem of document.querySelectorAll('*')) {\n    elem.addEventListener(\"click\", e => alert(`Capturing: ${elem.tagName}`), true);\n    elem.addEventListener(\"click\", e => alert(`Bubbling: ${elem.tagName}`));\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\nThe code sets click handlers on *every* element in the document to see which ones are working.\n\nIf you click on `<p>`, then the sequence is:\n\n1. `HTML` -> `BODY` -> `FORM` -> `DIV` (capturing phase, the first listener):\n2. `P` (target phase, triggers two times, as we've set two listeners: capturing and bubbling)\n3. `DIV` -> `FORM` -> `BODY` -> `HTML` (bubbling phase, the second listener).\n\nThere's a property `event.eventPhase` that tells us the number of the phase on which the event was caught. But it's rarely used, because we usually know it in the handler.\n\n```smart header=\"To remove the handler, `removeEventListener` needs the same phase\"\nIf we `addEventListener(..., true)`, then we should mention the same phase in `removeEventListener(..., true)` to correctly remove the handler.\n```\n\n````smart header=\"Listeners on same element and same phase run in their set order\"\nIf we have multiple event handlers on the same phase, assigned to the same element with `addEventListener`, they run in the same order as they are created:\n\n```js\nelem.addEventListener(\"click\", e => alert(1)); // guaranteed to trigger first\nelem.addEventListener(\"click\", e => alert(2));\n```\n````\n\n\n## Summary\n\nWhen an event happens -- the most nested element where it happens gets labeled as the \"target element\" (`event.target`).\n\n- Then the event moves down from the document root to `event.target`, calling handlers assigned with `addEventListener(..., true)` on the way (`true` is a shorthand for `{capture: true}`).\n- Then handlers are called on the target element itself.\n- Then the event bubbles up from `event.target` up to the root, calling handlers assigned using `on<event>` and `addEventListener` without the 3rd argument or with the 3rd argument `false/{capture:false}`.\n\nEach handler can access `event` object properties:\n\n- `event.target` -- the deepest element that originated the event.\n- `event.currentTarget` (=`this`) -- the current element that handles the event (the one that has the handler on it)\n- `event.eventPhase` -- the current phase (capturing=1, target=2, bubbling=3).\n\nAny event handler can stop the event by calling `event.stopPropagation()`, but that's not recommended, because we can't really be sure we won't need it above, maybe for completely different things.\n\nThe capturing phase is used very rarely, usually we handle events on bubbling. And there's a logic behind that.\n\nIn real world, when an accident happens, local authorities react first. They know best the area where it happened. Then higher-level authorities if needed.\n\nThe same for event handlers. The code that set the handler on a particular element knows maximum  details about the element and what it does. A handler on a particular `<td>` may be suited for that exactly `<td>`, it knows everything about it, so it should get the chance first. Then its immediate parent also knows about the context, but a little bit less, and so on till the very top element that handles general concepts and runs the last.\n\nBubbling and capturing lay the foundation for \"event delegation\" -- an extremely powerful event handling pattern that we study in the next chapter.",

        "content": "\n\nCapturing and bubbling allow us to implement one of most powerful event handling patterns called *event delegation*.\n\nThe idea is that if we have a lot of elements handled in a similar way, then instead of assigning a handler to each of them -- we put a single handler on their common ancestor.\n\nIn the handler we get `event.target`, see where the event actually happened and handle it.\n\nLet's see an example -- the [Ba-Gua diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba_gua) reflecting the ancient Chinese philosophy.\n\nHere it is:\n\n[iframe height=350 src=\"bagua\" edit link]\n\nThe HTML is like this:\n\n```html\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th colspan=\"3\"><em>Bagua</em> Chart: Direction, Element, Color, Meaning</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"nw\"><strong>Northwest</strong><br>Metal<br>Silver<br>Elders</td>\n    <td class=\"n\">...</td>\n    <td class=\"ne\">...</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>...2 more lines of this kind...</tr>\n  <tr>...2 more lines of this kind...</tr>\n</table>\n```\n\nThe table has 9 cells, but there could be 99 or 9999, doesn't matter.\n\n**Our task is to highlight a cell `<td>` on click.**\n\nInstead of assign an `onclick` handler to each `<td>` (can be many) -- we'll setup the \"catch-all\" handler on `<table>` element.\n\nIt will use `event.target` to get the clicked element and highlight it.\n\nThe code:\n\n```js\nlet selectedTd;\n\n*!*\ntable.onclick = function(event) {\n  let target = event.target; // where was the click?\n\n  if (target.tagName != 'TD') return; // not on TD? Then we're not interested\n\n  highlight(target); // highlight it\n};\n*/!*\n\nfunction highlight(td) {\n  if (selectedTd) { // remove the existing highlight if any\n    selectedTd.classList.remove('highlight');\n  }\n  selectedTd = td;\n  selectedTd.classList.add('highlight'); // highlight the new td\n}\n```\n\nSuch a code doesn't care how many cells there are in the table. We can add/remove `<td>` dynamically at any time and the highlighting will still work.\n\nStill, there's a drawback.\n\nThe click may occur not on the `<td>`, but inside it.\n\nIn our case if we take a look inside the HTML, we can see nested tags inside `<td>`, like `<strong>`:\n\n```html\n<td>\n*!*\n  <strong>Northwest</strong>\n*/!*\n  ...\n</td>\n```\n\nNaturally, if a click happens on that `<strong>` then it becomes the value of `event.target`.\n\n![](bagua-bubble.svg)\n\nIn the handler `table.onclick` we should take such `event.target` and find out whether the click was inside `<td>` or not.\n\nHere's the improved code:\n\n```js\ntable.onclick = function(event) {\n  let td = event.target.closest('td'); // (1)\n\n  if (!td) return; // (2)\n\n  if (!table.contains(td)) return; // (3)\n\n  highlight(td); // (4)\n};\n```\n\nExplanations:\n1. The method `elem.closest(selector)` returns the nearest ancestor that matches the selector. In our case we look for `<td>` on the way up from the source element.\n2. If `event.target` is not inside any `<td>`, then the call returns immediately, as there's nothing to do.\n3. In case of nested tables, `event.target` may be a `<td>`, but lying outside of the current table. So we check if that's actually *our table's* `<td>`.\n4. And, if it's so, then highlight it.\n\nAs the result, we have a fast, efficient highlighting code, that doesn't care about the total number of `<td>` in the table.\n\n## Delegation example: actions in markup\n\nThere are other uses for event delegation.\n\nLet's say, we want to make a menu with buttons \"Save\", \"Load\", \"Search\" and so on. And there's an object with methods `save`, `load`, `search`... How to match them?\n\nThe first idea may be to assign a separate handler to each button. But there's a more elegant solution. We can add a handler for the whole menu and `data-action` attributes for buttons that has the method to call:\n\n```html\n<button *!*data-action=\"save\"*/!*>Click to Save</button>\n```\n\nThe handler reads the attribute and executes the method. Take a look at the working example:\n\n```html autorun height=60 run untrusted\n<div id=\"menu\">\n  <button data-action=\"save\">Save</button>\n  <button data-action=\"load\">Load</button>\n  <button data-action=\"search\">Search</button>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n  class Menu {\n    constructor(elem) {\n      this._elem = elem;\n      elem.onclick = this.onClick.bind(this); // (*)\n    }\n\n    save() {\n      alert('saving');\n    }\n\n    load() {\n      alert('loading');\n    }\n\n    search() {\n      alert('searching');\n    }\n\n    onClick(event) {\n*!*\n      let action = event.target.dataset.action;\n      if (action) {\n        this[action]();\n      }\n*/!*\n    };\n  }\n\n  new Menu(menu);\n</script>\n```\n\nPlease note that `this.onClick` is bound to `this` in `(*)`. That's important, because otherwise `this` inside it would reference the DOM element (`elem`), not the `Menu` object, and `this[action]` would not be what we need.\n\nSo, what advantages does delegation give us here?\n\n```compare\n+ We don't need to write the code to assign a handler to each button. Just make a method and put it in the markup.\n+ The HTML structure is flexible, we can add/remove buttons at any time.\n```\n\nWe could also use classes `.action-save`, `.action-load`, but an attribute `data-action` is better semantically. And we can use it in CSS rules too.\n\n## The \"behavior\" pattern\n\nWe can also use event delegation to add \"behaviors\" to elements *declaratively*, with special attributes and classes.\n\nThe pattern has two parts:\n1. We add a custom attribute to an element that describes its behavior.\n2. A document-wide handler tracks events, and if an event happens on an attributed element -- performs the action.\n\n### Behavior: Counter\n\nFor instance, here the attribute `data-counter` adds a behavior: \"increase value on click\" to buttons:\n\n```html run autorun height=60\nCounter: <input type=\"button\" value=\"1\" data-counter>\nOne more counter: <input type=\"button\" value=\"2\" data-counter>\n\n<script>\n  document.addEventListener('click', function(event) {\n\n    if (event.target.dataset.counter != undefined) { // if the attribute exists...\n      event.target.value++;\n    }\n\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\nIf we click a button -- its value is increased. Not buttons, but the general approach is important here.\n\nThere can be as many attributes with `data-counter` as we want. We can add new ones to HTML at any moment. Using the event delegation we \"extended\" HTML, added an attribute that describes a new behavior.\n\n```warn header=\"For document-level handlers -- always `addEventListener`\"\nWhen we assign an event handler to the `document` object, we should always use `addEventListener`, not `document.on<event>`, because the latter will cause conflicts: new handlers overwrite old ones.\n\nFor real projects it's normal that there are many handlers on `document` set by different parts of the code.\n```\n\n### Behavior: Toggler\n\nOne more example of behavior. A click on an element with the attribute `data-toggle-id` will show/hide the element with the given `id`:\n\n```html autorun run height=60\n<button *!*data-toggle-id=\"subscribe-mail\"*/!*>\n  Show the subscription form\n</button>\n\n<form id=\"subscribe-mail\" hidden>\n  Your mail: <input type=\"email\">\n</form>\n\n<script>\n*!*\n  document.addEventListener('click', function(event) {\n    let id = event.target.dataset.toggleId;\n    if (!id) return;\n\n    let elem = document.getElementById(id);\n\n    elem.hidden = !elem.hidden;\n  });\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\nLet's note once again what we did. Now, to add toggling functionality to an element -- there's no need to know JavaScript, just use the attribute `data-toggle-id`.\n\nThat may become really convenient -- no need to write JavaScript for every such element. Just use the behavior. The document-level handler makes it work for any element of the page.\n\nWe can combine multiple behaviors on a single element as well.\n\nThe \"behavior\" pattern can be an alternative to mini-fragments of JavaScript.\n\n## Summary\n\nEvent delegation is really cool! It's one of the most helpful patterns for DOM events.\n\nIt's often used to add the same handling for many similar elements, but not only for that.\n\nThe algorithm:\n\n1. Put a single handler on the container.\n2. In the handler -- check the source element `event.target`.\n3. If the event happened inside an element that interests us, then handle the event.\n\nBenefits:\n\n```compare\n+ Simplifies initialization and saves memory: no need to add many handlers.\n+ Less code: when adding or removing elements, no need to add/remove handlers.\n+ DOM modifications: we can mass add/remove elements with `innerHTML` and the like.\n```\n\nThe delegation has its limitations of course:\n\n```compare\n- First, the event must be bubbling. Some events do not bubble. Also, low-level handlers should not use `event.stopPropagation()`.\n- Second, the delegation may add CPU load, because the container-level handler reacts on events in any place of the container, no matter whether they interest us or not. But usually the load is negligible, so we don't take it into account.\n```",

        "content": "\n\nMany events automatically lead to certain actions performed by the browser.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- A click on a link - initiates navigation to its URL.\n- A click on a form submit button - initiates its submission to the server.\n- Pressing a mouse button over a text and moving it - selects the text.\n\nIf we handle an event in JavaScript, we may not want the corresponding browser action to happen, and want to implement another behavior instead.\n\n## Preventing browser actions\n\nThere are two ways to tell the browser we don't want it to act:\n\n- The main way is to use the `event` object. There's a method `event.preventDefault()`.\n- If the handler is assigned using `on<event>` (not by `addEventListener`), then returning `false` also works the same.\n\nIn this HTML a click on a link doesn't lead to navigation, browser doesn't do anything:\n\n```html autorun height=60 no-beautify\n<a href=\"/\" onclick=\"return false\">Click here</a>\nor\n<a href=\"/\" onclick=\"event.preventDefault()\">here</a>\n```\n\nIn the next example we'll use this technique to create a JavaScript-powered menu.\n\n```warn header=\"Returning `false` from a handler is an exception\"\nThe value returned by an event handler is usually ignored.\n\nThe only exception is `return false` from a handler assigned using `on<event>`.\n\nIn all other cases, `return` value is ignored. In particular, there's no sense in returning `true`.\n```\n\n### Example: the menu\n\nConsider a site menu, like this:\n\n```html\n<ul id=\"menu\" class=\"menu\">\n  <li><a href=\"/html\">HTML</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/javascript\">JavaScript</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/css\">CSS</a></li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nHere's how it looks with some CSS:\n\n[iframe height=70 src=\"menu\" link edit]\n\nMenu items are implemented as HTML-links `<a>`, not buttons `<button>`. There are several reasons to do so, for instance:\n\n- Many people like to use \"right click\" -- \"open in a new window\". If we use `<button>` or `<span>`, that doesn't work.\n- Search engines follow `<a href=\"...\">` links while indexing.\n\nSo we use `<a>` in the markup. But normally we intend to handle clicks in JavaScript. So we should prevent the default browser action.\n\nLike here:\n\n```js\nmenu.onclick = function(event) {\n  if (event.target.nodeName != 'A') return;\n\n  let href = event.target.getAttribute('href');\n  alert( href ); // ...can be loading from the server, UI generation etc\n\n*!*\n  return false; // prevent browser action (don't go to the URL)\n*/!*\n};\n```\n\nIf we omit `return false`, then after our code executes the browser will do its \"default action\" -- navigating to the URL in `href`. And we don't need that here, as we're handling the click by ourselves.\n\nBy the way, using event delegation here makes our menu very flexible. We can add nested lists and style them using CSS to \"slide down\".\n\n````smart header=\"Follow-up events\"\nCertain events flow one into another. If we prevent the first event, there will be no second.\n\nFor instance, `mousedown` on an `<input>` field leads to focusing in it, and the `focus` event. If we prevent the `mousedown` event, there's no focus.\n\nTry to click on the first `<input>` below -- the `focus` event happens. But if you click the second one, there's no focus.\n\n```html run autorun\n<input value=\"Focus works\" onfocus=\"this.value=''\">\n<input *!*onmousedown=\"return false\"*/!* onfocus=\"this.value=''\" value=\"Click me\">\n```\n\nThat's because the browser action is canceled on `mousedown`. The focusing is still possible if we use another way to enter the input. For instance, the `key:Tab` key to switch from the 1st input into the 2nd. But not with the mouse click any more.\n````\n\n## The \"passive\" handler option\n\nThe optional `passive: true` option of `addEventListener` signals the browser that the handler is not going to call `preventDefault()`.\n\nWhy that may be needed?\n\nThere are some events like `touchmove` on mobile devices (when the user moves their finger across the screen), that cause scrolling by default, but that scrolling can be prevented using `preventDefault()` in the handler.\n\nSo when the browser detects such event, it has first to process all handlers, and then if `preventDefault` is not called anywhere, it can proceed with scrolling. That may cause unnecessary delays and \"jitters\" in the UI.\n\nThe `passive: true` options tells the browser that the handler is not going to cancel scrolling. Then browser scrolls immediately providing a maximally fluent experience, and the event is handled by the way.\n\nFor some browsers (Firefox, Chrome), `passive` is `true` by default for `touchstart` and `touchmove` events.\n\n\n## event.defaultPrevented\n\nThe property `event.defaultPrevented` is `true` if the default action was prevented, and `false` otherwise.\n\nThere's an interesting use case for it.\n\nYou remember in the chapter <info:bubbling-and-capturing> we talked about `event.stopPropagation()` and why stopping bubbling is bad?\n\nSometimes we can use `event.defaultPrevented` instead, to signal other event handlers that the event was handled.\n\nLet's see a practical example.\n\nBy default the browser on `contextmenu` event (right mouse click) shows a context menu with standard options. We can prevent it and show our own, like this:\n\n```html autorun height=50 no-beautify run\n<button>Right-click shows browser context menu</button>\n\n<button *!*oncontextmenu=\"alert('Draw our menu'); return false\"*/!*>\n  Right-click shows our context menu\n</button>\n```\n\nNow, in addition to that context menu we'd like to implement document-wide context menu.\n\nUpon right click, the closest context menu should show up.\n\n```html autorun height=80 no-beautify run\n<p>Right-click here for the document context menu</p>\n<button id=\"elem\">Right-click here for the button context menu</button>\n\n<script>\n  elem.oncontextmenu = function(event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    alert(\"Button context menu\");\n  };\n\n  document.oncontextmenu = function(event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    alert(\"Document context menu\");\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\nThe problem is that when we click on `elem`, we get two menus: the button-level and (the event bubbles up) the document-level menu.\n\nHow to fix it? One of solutions is to think like: \"When we handle right-click in the button handler, let's stop its bubbling\" and use `event.stopPropagation()`:\n\n```html autorun height=80 no-beautify run\n<p>Right-click for the document menu</p>\n<button id=\"elem\">Right-click for the button menu (fixed with event.stopPropagation)</button>\n\n<script>\n  elem.oncontextmenu = function(event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n*!*\n    event.stopPropagation();\n*/!*\n    alert(\"Button context menu\");\n  };\n\n  document.oncontextmenu = function(event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    alert(\"Document context menu\");\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\nNow the button-level menu works as intended. But the price is high. We forever deny access to information about right-clicks for any outer code, including counters that gather statistics and so on. That's quite unwise.\n\nAn alternative solution would be to check in the `document` handler if the default action was prevented? If it is so, then the event was handled, and we don't need to react on it.\n\n\n```html autorun height=80 no-beautify run\n<p>Right-click for the document menu (added a check for event.defaultPrevented)</p>\n<button id=\"elem\">Right-click for the button menu</button>\n\n<script>\n  elem.oncontextmenu = function(event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    alert(\"Button context menu\");\n  };\n\n  document.oncontextmenu = function(event) {\n*!*\n    if (event.defaultPrevented) return;\n*/!*\n\n    event.preventDefault();\n    alert(\"Document context menu\");\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\nNow everything also works correctly. If we have nested elements, and each of them has a context menu of its own, that would also work. Just make sure to check for `event.defaultPrevented` in each `contextmenu` handler.\n\n```smart header=\"event.stopPropagation() and event.preventDefault()\"\nAs we can clearly see, `event.stopPropagation()` and `event.preventDefault()` (also known as `return false`) are two different things. They are not related to each other.\n```\n\n```smart header=\"Nested context menus architecture\"\nThere are also alternative ways to implement nested context menus. One of them is to have a single global object with a handler for `document.oncontextmenu`, and also methods that allow us to store other handlers in it.\n\nThe object will catch any right-click, look through stored handlers and run the appropriate one.\n\nBut then each piece of code that wants a context menu should know about that object and use its help instead of the own `contextmenu` handler.\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nThere are many default browser actions:\n\n- `mousedown` -- starts the selection (move the mouse to select).\n- `click` on `<input type=\"checkbox\">` -- checks/unchecks the `input`.\n- `submit` -- clicking an `<input type=\"submit\">` or hitting `key:Enter` inside a form field causes this event to happen, and the browser submits the form after it.\n- `keydown` -- pressing a key may lead to adding a character into a field, or other actions.\n- `contextmenu` -- the event happens on a right-click, the action is to show the browser context menu.\n- ...there are more...\n\nAll the default actions can be prevented if we want to handle the event exclusively by JavaScript.\n\nTo prevent a default action -- use either `event.preventDefault()` or  `return false`. The second method works only for handlers assigned with `on<event>`.\n\nThe `passive: true` option of `addEventListener` tells the browser that the action is not going to be prevented. That's useful for some mobile events, like `touchstart` and `touchmove`, to tell the browser that it should not wait for all handlers to finish before scrolling.\n\nIf the default action was prevented, the value of `event.defaultPrevented` becomes `true`, otherwise it's `false`.\n\n```warn header=\"Stay semantic, don't abuse\"\nTechnically, by preventing default actions and adding JavaScript we can customize the behavior of any elements. For instance, we can make a link `<a>` work like a button, and a button `<button>` behave as a link (redirect to another URL or so).\n\nBut we should generally keep the semantic meaning of HTML elements. For instance, `<a>` should perform navigation, not a button.\n\nBesides being \"just a good thing\", that makes your HTML better in terms of accessibility.\n\nAlso if we consider the example with `<a>`, then please note: a browser allows us to open such links in a new window (by right-clicking them and other means). And people like that. But if we make a button behave as a link using JavaScript and even look like a link using CSS, then `<a>`-specific browser features still won't work for it.\n```",

        "content": "\n\nWe can not only assign handlers, but also generate events from JavaScript.\n\nCustom events can be used to create \"graphical components\". For instance, a root element of our own JS-based menu may trigger events telling what happens with the menu: `open` (menu open), `select` (an item is selected) and so on. Another code may listen for the events and observe what's happening with the menu.\n\nWe can generate not only completely new events, that we invent for our own purposes, but also built-in ones, such as `click`, `mousedown` etc. That may be helpful for automated testing.\n\n## Event constructor\n\nBuild-in event classes form a hierarchy, similar to DOM element classes. The root is the built-in [Event](http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#event) class.\n\nWe can create `Event` objects like this:\n\n```js\nlet event = new Event(type[, options]);\n```\n\nArguments:\n\n- *type* -- event type, a string like `\"click\"` or our own like `\"my-event\"`.\n- *options* -- the object with two optional properties:\n  - `bubbles: true/false` -- if `true`, then the event bubbles.\n  - `cancelable: true/false` -- if `true`, then the \"default action\"  may be prevented. Later we'll see what it means for custom events.\n\n  By default both are false: `{bubbles: false, cancelable: false}`.\n\n## dispatchEvent\n\nAfter an event object is created, we should \"run\" it on an element using the call `elem.dispatchEvent(event)`.\n\nThen handlers react on it as if it were a regular browser event. If the event was created with the `bubbles` flag, then it bubbles.\n\nIn the example below the `click` event is initiated in JavaScript. The handler works same way as if the button was clicked:\n\n```html run no-beautify\n<button id=\"elem\" onclick=\"alert('Click!');\">Autoclick</button>\n\n<script>\n  let event = new Event(\"click\");\n  elem.dispatchEvent(event);\n</script>\n```\n\n```smart header=\"event.isTrusted\"\nThere is a way to tell a \"real\" user event from a script-generated one.\n\nThe property `event.isTrusted` is `true` for events that come from real user actions and `false` for script-generated events.\n```\n\n## Bubbling example\n\nWe can create a bubbling event with the name `\"hello\"` and catch it on `document`.\n\nAll we need is to set `bubbles` to `true`:\n\n```html run no-beautify\n<h1 id=\"elem\">Hello from the script!</h1>\n\n<script>\n  // catch on document...\n  document.addEventListener(\"hello\", function(event) { // (1)\n    alert(\"Hello from \" + event.target.tagName); // Hello from H1\n  });\n\n  // ...dispatch on elem!\n  let event = new Event(\"hello\", {bubbles: true}); // (2)\n  elem.dispatchEvent(event);\n\n  // the handler on document will activate and display the message.\n\n</script>\n```\n\n\nNotes:\n\n1. We should use `addEventListener` for our custom events, because `on<event>` only exists for built-in events, `document.onhello` doesn't work.\n2. Must set `bubbles:true`, otherwise the event won't bubble up.\n\nThe bubbling mechanics is the same for built-in (`click`) and custom (`hello`) events. There are also capturing and bubbling stages.\n\n## MouseEvent, KeyboardEvent and others\n\nHere's a short list of classes for UI Events from the [UI Event specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents):\n\n- `UIEvent`\n- `FocusEvent`\n- `MouseEvent`\n- `WheelEvent`\n- `KeyboardEvent`\n- ...\n\nWe should use them instead of `new Event` if we want to create such events. For instance, `new MouseEvent(\"click\")`.\n\nThe right constructor allows to specify standard properties for that type of event.\n\nLike `clientX/clientY` for a mouse event:\n\n```js run\nlet event = new MouseEvent(\"click\", {\n  bubbles: true,\n  cancelable: true,\n  clientX: 100,\n  clientY: 100\n});\n\n*!*\nalert(event.clientX); // 100\n*/!*\n```\n\nPlease note: the generic `Event` constructor does not allow that.\n\nLet's try:\n\n```js run\nlet event = new Event(\"click\", {\n  bubbles: true, // only bubbles and cancelable\n  cancelable: true, // work in the Event constructor\n  clientX: 100,\n  clientY: 100\n});\n\n*!*\nalert(event.clientX); // undefined, the unknown property is ignored!\n*/!*\n```\n\nTechnically, we can work around that by assigning directly `event.clientX=100` after creation. So that's a matter of convenience and following the rules. Browser-generated events always have the right type.\n\nThe full list of properties for different UI events is in the specification, for instance, [MouseEvent](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/#mouseevent).\n\n## Custom events\n\nFor our own, completely new events types like `\"hello\"` we should use `new CustomEvent`. Technically [CustomEvent](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#customevent) is the same as `Event`, with one exception.\n\nIn the second argument (object) we can add an additional property `detail` for any custom information that we want to pass with the event.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run refresh\n<h1 id=\"elem\">Hello for John!</h1>\n\n<script>\n  // additional details come with the event to the handler\n  elem.addEventListener(\"hello\", function(event) {\n    alert(*!*event.detail.name*/!*);\n  });\n\n  elem.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(\"hello\", {\n*!*\n    detail: { name: \"John\" }\n*/!*\n  }));\n</script>\n```\n\nThe `detail` property can have any data. Technically we could live without, because we can assign any properties into a regular `new Event` object after its creation. But `CustomEvent` provides the special `detail` field for it to evade conflicts with other event properties.\n\nBesides, the event class describes \"what kind of event\" it is, and if the event is custom, then we should use `CustomEvent` just to be clear about what it is.\n\n## event.preventDefault()\n\nMany browser events have a \"default action\", such as nagivating to a link, starting a selection, and so on.\n\nFor new, custom events, there are definitely no default browser actions, but a code that dispatches such event may have its own plans what to do after triggering the event.\n\nBy calling `event.preventDefault()`, an event handler may send a signal that those actions should be canceled.\n\nIn that case the call to `elem.dispatchEvent(event)` returns `false`. And the code that dispatched it knows that it shouldn't continue.\n\nLet's see a practical example - a hiding rabbit (could be a closing menu or something else).\n\nBelow you can see a `#rabbit` and `hide()` function that dispatches `\"hide\"` event on it, to let all interested parties know that the rabbit is going to hide.\n\nAny handler can listen for that event with `rabbit.addEventListener('hide',...)` and, if needed, cancel the action using `event.preventDefault()`. Then the rabbit won't disappear:\n\n```html run refresh autorun\n<pre id=\"rabbit\">\n  |\\   /|\n   \\|_|/\n   /. .\\\n  =\\_Y_/=\n   {>o<}\n</pre>\n<button onclick=\"hide()\">Hide()</button>\n\n<script>\n  // hide() will be called automatically in 2 seconds\n  function hide() {\n    let event = new CustomEvent(\"hide\", {\n      cancelable: true // without that flag preventDefault doesn't work\n    });\n    if (!rabbit.dispatchEvent(event)) {\n      alert('The action was prevented by a handler');\n    } else {\n      rabbit.hidden = true;\n    }\n  }\n\n  rabbit.addEventListener('hide', function(event) {\n    if (confirm(\"Call preventDefault?\")) {\n      event.preventDefault();\n    }\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\nPlease note: the event must have the flag `cancelable: true`, otherwise the call `event.preventDefault()` is ignored.\n\n## Events-in-events are synchronous\n\nUsually events are processed in a queue. That is: if the browser is processing `onclick` and a new event occurs, e.g. mouse moved, then it's handing is queued up, corresponding `mousemove` handlers will be called after `onclick` processing is finished.\n\nThe notable exception is when one event is initiated from within another one, e.g. using `dispatchEvent`. Such events are processed immediately: the new event handlers are called, and then the current event handling is resumed.\n\nFor instance, in the code below the `menu-open` event is triggered during the `onclick`.\n\nIt's processed immediately, without waiting for `onlick` handler to end:\n\n\n```html run autorun\n<button id=\"menu\">Menu (click me)</button>\n\n<script>\n  menu.onclick = function() {\n    alert(1);\n\n    menu.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(\"menu-open\", {\n      bubbles: true\n    }));\n\n    alert(2);\n  };\n\n  // triggers between 1 and 2\n  document.addEventListener('menu-open', () => alert('nested'));\n</script>\n```\n\nThe output order is: 1 -> nested -> 2.\n\nPlease note that the nested event `menu-open` is caught on the `document`. The propagation and handling of the nested event is finished before the processing gets back to the outer code (`onclick`).\n\nThat's not only about `dispatchEvent`, there are other cases. If an event handler calls methods that trigger to other events -- they are too processed synchronously, in a nested fashion.\n\nLet's say we don't like it. We'd want `onclick` to be fully processed first, independently from `menu-open` or any other nested events.\n\nThen we can either put the `dispatchEvent` (or another event-triggering call) at the end of `onclick` or, maybe better, wrap it in the zero-delay `setTimeout`:\n\n```html run\n<button id=\"menu\">Menu (click me)</button>\n\n<script>\n  menu.onclick = function() {\n    alert(1);\n\n    setTimeout(() => menu.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(\"menu-open\", {\n      bubbles: true\n    })));\n\n    alert(2);\n  };\n\n  document.addEventListener('menu-open', () => alert('nested'));\n</script>\n```\n\nNow `dispatchEvent` runs asynchronously after the current code execution is finished, including `mouse.onclick`, so event handlers are totally separate.\n\nThe output order becomes: 1 -> 2 -> nested.\n\n## Summary\n\nTo generate an event from code, we first need to create an event object.\n\nThe generic `Event(name, options)` constructor accepts an arbitrary event name and the `options` object with two properties:\n- `bubbles: true` if the event should bubble.\n- `cancelable: true` if the `event.preventDefault()` should work.\n\nOther constructors of native events like `MouseEvent`, `KeyboardEvent` and so on accept properties specific to that event type. For instance, `clientX` for mouse events.\n\nFor custom events we should use `CustomEvent` constructor. It has an additional option named `detail`, we should assign the event-specific data to it. Then all handlers can access it as `event.detail`.\n\nDespite the technical possibility to generate browser events like `click` or `keydown`, we should use with the great care.\n\nWe shouldn't generate browser events as it's a hacky way to run handlers. That's a bad architecture most of the time.\n\nNative events might be generated:\n\n- As a dirty hack to make 3rd-party libraries work the needed way, if they don't provide other means of interaction.\n- For automated testing, to \"click the button\" in the script and see if the interface reacts correctly.\n\nCustom events with our own names are often generated for architectural purposes, to signal what happens inside our menus, sliders, carousels etc.",

        "content": "\n\nIn this chapter we'll get into more details about mouse events and their properties.\n\nPlease note: such events may come not only from \"mouse devices\", but are also from other devices, such as phones and tablets, where they are emulated for compatibility.\n\n## Mouse event types\n\nWe've already seen some of these events:\n\n`mousedown/mouseup`\n: Mouse button is clicked/released over an element.\n\n`mouseover/mouseout`\n: Mouse pointer comes over/out from an element.\n\n`mousemove`\n: Every mouse move over an element triggers that event.\n\n`click`\n: Triggers after `mousedown` and then `mouseup` over the same element if the left mouse button was used.\n\n`dblclick`\n: Triggers after two clicks on the same element within a short timeframe. Rarely used nowadays.\n\n`contextmenu`\n: Triggers when when the right mouse button is pressed. There are other ways to open a context menu, e.g. using a special keyboard key, it triggers in that case also, so it's not exactly the mouse event.\n\n...There are several other events too, we'll cover them later.\n\n## Events order\n\nAs you can see from the list above, a user action may trigger multiple events.\n\nFor instance, a left-button click first triggers `mousedown`, when the button is pressed, then `mouseup` and `click` when it's released.\n\nIn cases when a single action initiates multiple events, their order is fixed. That is, the handlers are called in the order `mousedown` -> `mouseup` -> `click`. \n\n```online\nClick the button below and you'll see the events. Try double-click too.\n\nOn the teststand below all mouse events are logged, and if there is more than a 1 second delay between them they are separated by a horizontal ruler.\n\nAlso we can see the `button` property that allows to detect the mouse button, it's explained below.\n\n<input onmousedown=\"return logMouse(event)\" onmouseup=\"return logMouse(event)\" onclick=\"return logMouse(event)\" oncontextmenu=\"return logMouse(event)\" ondblclick=\"return logMouse(event)\" value=\"Click me with the right or the left mouse button\" type=\"button\"> <input onclick=\"logClear('test')\" value=\"Clear\" type=\"button\"> <form id=\"testform\" name=\"testform\"> <textarea style=\"font-size:12px;height:150px;width:360px;\"></textarea></form>\n```\n\n## Mouse button\n\nClick-related events always have the `button` property, which allows to get the exact mouse button.\n\nWe usually don't use it for `click` and `contextmenu` events, because the former happens only on left-click, and the latter -- only on right-click. \n\nFrom the other hand, `mousedown` and `mouseup` handlers we may need `event.button`, because these events trigger on any button, so `button` allows to distinguish between \"right-mousedown\" and \"left-mousedown\".\n\nThe possible values of `event.button` are:\n\n| Button state | `event.button` |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| Left button (primary) | 0 |\n| Middle button (auxillary) | 1 |\n| Right button (secondary) | 2 |\n| X1 button (back) | 3 |\n| X2 button (forward) | 4 |\n\nMost mouse devices only have the left and right buttons, so possible values are `0` or `2`. Touch devices also generate similar events when one taps on them.\n\nAlso there's `event.buttons` property that has all currently pressed buttons as an integer, one bit per button. In practice this property is very rarely used, you can find details at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/buttons) if you ever need it.\n\n```warn header=\"The outdated `event.which`\"\nOld code may use `event.which` property that's an old non-standard way of getting a button, with possible values:\n\n- `event.which == 1` – left button,\n- `event.which == 2` – middle button,\n- `event.which == 3` – right button.\n\nAs of now, `event.which` is deprecated, we shouldn't use it.\n```\n\n## Modifiers: shift, alt, ctrl and meta\n\nAll mouse events include the information about pressed modifier keys.\n\nEvent properties:\n\n- `shiftKey`: `key:Shift`\n- `altKey`: `key:Alt` (or `key:Opt` for Mac)\n- `ctrlKey`: `key:Ctrl`\n- `metaKey`: `key:Cmd` for Mac\n\nThey are `true` if the corresponding key was pressed during the event.\n\nFor instance, the button below only works on `key:Alt+Shift`+click:\n\n```html autorun height=60\n<button id=\"button\">Alt+Shift+Click on me!</button>\n\n<script>\n  button.onclick = function(event) {\n*!*\n    if (event.altKey && event.shiftKey) {\n*/!*\n      alert('Hooray!');\n    }\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\n```warn header=\"Attention: on Mac it's usually `Cmd` instead of `Ctrl`\"\nOn Windows and Linux there are modifier keys `key:Alt`, `key:Shift` and `key:Ctrl`. On Mac there's one more: `key:Cmd`, corresponding to the property `metaKey`.\n\nIn most applications, when Windows/Linux uses `key:Ctrl`, on Mac `key:Cmd` is used.\n\nThat is: where a Windows user presses `key:Ctrl+Enter` or `key:Ctrl+A`, a Mac user would press `key:Cmd+Enter` or `key:Cmd+A`, and so on.\n\nSo if we want to support combinations like `key:Ctrl`+click, then for Mac it makes sense to use `key:Cmd`+click. That's more comfortable for Mac users.\n\nEven if we'd like to force Mac users to `key:Ctrl`+click -- that's kind of difficult. The problem is: a left-click with `key:Ctrl` is interpreted as a *right-click* on MacOS, and it generates the `contextmenu` event, not `click` like Windows/Linux.\n\nSo if we want users of all operating systems to feel comfortable, then together with `ctrlKey` we should check `metaKey`.\n\nFor JS-code it means that we should check `if (event.ctrlKey || event.metaKey)`.\n```\n\n```warn header=\"There are also mobile devices\"\nKeyboard combinations are good as an addition to the workflow. So that if the visitor uses a keyboard -- they work. \n\nBut if their device doesn't have it -- then there should be a way to live without modifier keys.\n```\n\n## Coordinates: clientX/Y, pageX/Y\n\nAll mouse events provide coordinates in two flavours:\n\n1. Window-relative: `clientX` and `clientY`.\n2. Document-relative: `pageX` and `pageY`.\n\nWe already covered the difference between them in the chapter <info:coordinates>.\n\nIn short, document-relative coordinates `pageX/Y` are counted from the left-upper corner of the document, and do not change when the page is scrolled, while `clientX/Y` are counted from the current window left-upper corner. When the page is scrolled, they change.\n\nFor instance, if we have a window of the size 500x500, and the mouse is in the left-upper corner, then `clientX` and `clientY` are `0`, no matter how the page is scrolled. \n\nAnd if the mouse is in the center, then `clientX` and `clientY` are `250`, no matter what place in the document it is. They are similar to `position:fixed` in that aspect.\n\n````online\nMove the mouse over the input field to see `clientX/clientY` (the example is in the `iframe`, so coordinates are relative to that `iframe`):\n\n```html autorun height=50\n<input onmousemove=\"this.value=event.clientX+':'+event.clientY\" value=\"Mouse over me\">\n```\n````\n\n## Preventing selection on mousedown\n\nDouble mouse click has a side-effect that may be disturbing in some interfaces: it selects text.\n\nFor instance, a double-click on the text below selects it in addition to our handler:\n\n```html autorun height=50\n<span ondblclick=\"alert('dblclick')\">Double-click me</span>\n```\n\nIf one presses the left mouse button and, without releasing it, moves the mouse, that also makes the selection, often unwanted.\n\nThere are multiple ways to prevent the selection, that you can read in the chapter <info:selection-range>.\n\nIn this particular case the most reasonable way is to prevent the browser action on `mousedown`. It prevents both these selections:\n\n```html autorun height=50\nBefore...\n<b ondblclick=\"alert('Click!')\" *!*onmousedown=\"return false\"*/!*>\n  Double-click me\n</b>\n...After\n```\n\nNow the bold element is not selected on double clicks, and pressing the left button on it won't start the selection.\n\nPlease note: the text inside it is still selectable. However, the selection should start not on the text itself, but before or after it. Usually that's fine for users.\n\n````smart header=\"Preventing copying\"\nIf we want to disable selection to protect our page content from copy-pasting, then we can use another event: `oncopy`.\n\n```html autorun height=80 no-beautify\n<div *!*oncopy=\"alert('Copying forbidden!');return false\"*/!*>\n  Dear user,\n  The copying is forbidden for you.\n  If you know JS or HTML, then you can get everything from the page source though.\n</div>\n```\nIf you try to copy a piece of text in the `<div>`, that won't work, because the default action `oncopy` is prevented.\n\nSurely the user has access to HTML-source of the page, and can take the content from there, but not everyone knows how to do it.\n````\n\n## Summary\n\nMouse events have the following properties:\n\n- Button: `button`.\n- Modifier keys (`true` if pressed): `altKey`, `ctrlKey`, `shiftKey` and `metaKey` (Mac).\n  - If you want to handle `key:Ctrl`, then don't forget Mac users, they usually use `key:Cmd`, so it's better to check `if (e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey)`.\n\n- Window-relative coordinates: `clientX/clientY`.\n- Document-relative coordinates: `pageX/pageY`.\n\nThe default browser action of `mousedown` is text selection, if it's not good for the interface, then it should be prevented.\n\nIn the next chapter we'll see more details about events that follow pointer movement and how to track element changes under it.",

        "content": "\n\nLet's dive into more details about events that happen when the mouse moves between elements.\n\n## Events mouseover/mouseout, relatedTarget\n\nThe `mouseover` event occurs when a mouse pointer comes over an element, and `mouseout` -- when it leaves.\n\n![](mouseover-mouseout.svg)\n\nThese events are special, because they have property `relatedTarget`. This property complements `target`. When a mouse leaves one element for another, one of them becomes `target`, and the other one - `relatedTarget`.\n\nFor `mouseover`:\n\n- `event.target` -- is the element where the mouse came over.\n- `event.relatedTarget` -- is the element from which the mouse came (`relatedTarget` -> `target`).\n\nFor `mouseout` the reverse:\n\n- `event.target` -- is the element that the mouse left.\n- `event.relatedTarget` -- is the new under-the-pointer element, that mouse left for (`target` -> `relatedTarget`).\n\n```online\nIn the example below each face and its features are separate elements. When you move the mouse, you can see mouse events in the text area.\n\nEach event has the information about both `target` and `relatedTarget`:\n\n[codetabs src=\"mouseoverout\" height=280]\n```\n\n```warn header=\"`relatedTarget` can be `null`\"\nThe `relatedTarget` property can be `null`.\n\nThat's normal and just means that the mouse came not from another element, but from out of the window. Or that it left the window.\n\nWe should keep that possibility in mind when using `event.relatedTarget` in our code. If we access `event.relatedTarget.tagName`, then there will be an error.\n```\n\n## Skipping elements\n\nThe `mousemove` event triggers when the mouse moves. But that doesn't mean that every pixel leads to an event.\n\nThe browser checks the mouse position from time to time. And if it notices changes then triggers the events.\n\nThat means that if the visitor is moving the mouse very fast then some DOM-elements may be skipped:\n\n![](mouseover-mouseout-over-elems.svg)\n\nIf the mouse moves very fast from `#FROM` to `#TO` elements as painted above, then intermediate `<div>` elements (or some of them) may be skipped. The `mouseout` event may trigger on `#FROM` and then immediately `mouseover` on `#TO`.\n\nThat's good for performance, because there may be many intermediate elements. We don't really want to process in and out of each one.\n\nOn the other hand, we should keep in mind that the mouse pointer doesn't \"visit\" all elements along the way. It can \"jump\".\n\nIn particular, it's possible that the pointer jumps right inside the middle of the page from out of the window. In that case `relatedTarget` is `null`, because it came from \"nowhere\":\n\n![](mouseover-mouseout-from-outside.svg)\n\n```online\nYou can check it out \"live\" on a teststand below.\n\nIts HTML has two nested elements: the `<div id=\"child\">` is inside the `<div id=\"parent\">`. If you move the mouse fast over them, then maybe only the child div triggers events, or maybe the parent one, or maybe there will be no events at all.\n\nAlso move the pointer into the child `div`, and then move it out quickly down through the parent one. If the movement is fast enough, then the parent element is ignored. The mouse will cross the parent element without noticing it.\n\n[codetabs height=360 src=\"mouseoverout-fast\"]\n```\n\n```smart header=\"If `mouseover` triggered, there must be `mouseout`\"\nIn case of fast mouse movements, intermediate elements may be ignored, but one thing we know for sure: if the pointer \"officially\" entered an element (`mouseover` event generated), then upon leaving it we always get `mouseout`.\n```\n\n## Mouseout when leaving for a child\n\nAn important feature of `mouseout` -- it triggers, when the pointer moves from an element to its descendant, e.g. from `#parent` to `#child` in this HTML:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"parent\">\n  <div id=\"child\">...</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nIf we're on `#parent` and then move the pointer deeper into `#child`, but we get `mouseout` on `#parent`!\n\n![](mouseover-to-child.svg)\n\nThat may seem strange, but can be easily explained.\n\n**According to the browser logic, the mouse cursor may be only over a *single* element at any time -- the most nested one and top by z-index.**\n\nSo if it goes to another element (even a descendant), then it leaves the previous one.\n\nPlease note another important detail of event processing.\n\nThe `mouseover` event on a descendant bubbles up. So, if `#parent` has `mouseover` handler, it triggers:\n\n![](mouseover-bubble-nested.svg)\n\n```online\nYou can see that very well in the example below: `<div id=\"child\">` is inside the `<div id=\"parent\">`. There are `mouseover/out` handlers on `#parent` element that output event details.\n\nIf you move the mouse from `#parent` to `#child`, you see two events on `#parent`:\n1. `mouseout [target: parent]` (left the parent), then\n2. `mouseover [target: child]` (came to the child, bubbled).\n\n[codetabs height=360 src=\"mouseoverout-child\"]\n```\n\nAs shown, when the pointer moves from `#parent` element to `#child`, two handlers trigger on the parent element: `mouseout` and `mouseover`:\n\n```js\nparent.onmouseout = function(event) {\n  /* event.target: parent element */\n};\nparent.onmouseover = function(event) {\n  /* event.target: child element (bubbled) */\n};\n```\n\n**If we don't examine `event.target` inside the handlers, then it may seem that the mouse pointer left `#parent` element, and then immediately came back over it.**\n\nBut that's not the case! The pointer is still over the parent, it just moved deeper into the child element.\n\nIf there are some actions upon leaving the parent element, e.g. an animation runs in `parent.onmouseout`, we usually don't want it when the pointer just goes deeper into `#parent`.\n\nTo avoid it, we can check `relatedTarget` in the handler and, if the mouse is still inside the element, then ignore such event.\n\nAlternatively we can use other events: `mouseenter` and `mouseleave`, that we'll be covering now, as they don't have such problems.\n\n## Events mouseenter and mouseleave\n\nEvents `mouseenter/mouseleave` are like `mouseover/mouseout`. They trigger when the mouse pointer enters/leaves the element.\n\nBut there are two important differences:\n\n1. Transitions inside the element, to/from descendants, are not counted.\n2. Events `mouseenter/mouseleave` do not bubble.\n\nThese events are extremely simple.\n\nWhen the pointer enters an element -- `mouseenter` triggers. The exact location of the pointer inside the element or its descendants doesn't matter.\n\nWhen the pointer leaves an element -- `mouseleave` triggers.\n\n```online\nThis example is similar to the one above, but now the top element has `mouseenter/mouseleave` instead of `mouseover/mouseout`.\n\nAs you can see, the only generated events are the ones related to moving the pointer in and out of the top element. Nothing happens when the pointer goes to the child and back. Transitions between descendants are ignored\n\n[codetabs height=340 src=\"mouseleave\"]\n```\n\n## Event delegation\n\nEvents `mouseenter/leave` are very simple and easy to use. But they do not bubble. So we can't use event delegation with them.\n\nImagine we want to handle mouse enter/leave for table cells. And there are hundreds of cells.\n\nThe natural solution would be -- to set the handler on `<table>` and process events there. But `mouseenter/leave` don't bubble. So if such event happens on `<td>`, then only a handler on that `<td>` is able to catch it.\n\nHandlers for `mouseenter/leave` on `<table>` only trigger when the pointer enters/leaves the table as a whole. It's impossible to get any information about transitions inside it.\n\nSo, let's use `mouseover/mouseout`.\n\nLet's start with simple handlers that highlight the element under mouse:\n\n```js\n// let's highlight an element under the pointer\ntable.onmouseover = function(event) {\n  let target = event.target;\n  target.style.background = 'pink';\n};\n\ntable.onmouseout = function(event) {\n  let target = event.target;\n  target.style.background = '';\n};\n```\n\n```online\nHere they are in action. As the mouse travels across the elements of this table, the current one is highlighted:\n\n[codetabs height=480 src=\"mouseenter-mouseleave-delegation\"]\n```\n\nIn our case we'd like to handle transitions between table cells `<td>`: entering a cell and leaving it. Other transitions, such as inside the cell or outside of any cells, don't interest us. Let's filter them out.\n\nHere's what we can do:\n\n- Remember the currently highlighted `<td>` in a variable, let's call it `currentElem`.\n- On `mouseover` -- ignore the event if we're still inside the current `<td>`.\n- On `mouseout` -- ignore if we didn't leave the current `<td>`.\n\nHere's an example of code that accounts for all possible situations:\n\n[js src=\"mouseenter-mouseleave-delegation-2/script.js\"]\n\nOnce again, the important features are:\n1. It uses event delegation to handle entering/leaving of any `<td>` inside the table. So it relies on `mouseover/out` instead of `mouseenter/leave` that don't bubble and hence allow no delegation.\n2. Extra events, such as moving between descendants of `<td>` are filtered out, so that `onEnter/Leave` runs only if the pointer leaves or enters `<td>` as a whole.\n\n```online\nHere's the full example with all details:\n\n[codetabs height=460 src=\"mouseenter-mouseleave-delegation-2\"]\n\nTry to move the cursor in and out of table cells and inside them. Fast or slow -- doesn't matter. Only `<td>` as a whole is highlighted, unlike the example before.\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nWe covered events `mouseover`, `mouseout`, `mousemove`, `mouseenter` and `mouseleave`.\n\nThese things are good to note:\n\n- A fast mouse move may skip intermediate elements.\n- Events `mouseover/out` and `mouseenter/leave` have an additional property: `relatedTarget`. That's the element that we are coming from/to, complementary to `target`.\n\nEvents `mouseover/out` trigger even when we go from the parent element to a child element. The browser assumes that the mouse can be only over one element at one time -- the deepest one.\n\nEvents `mouseenter/leave` are different in that aspect: they only trigger when the mouse comes in and out the element as a whole. Also they do not bubble.",

        "content": "\n\nDrag'n'Drop is a great interface solution. Taking something and dragging and dropping it is a clear and simple way to do many things, from copying and moving documents (as in file managers) to ordering (dropping items into a cart).\n\nIn the modern HTML standard there's a [section about Drag and Drop](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#dnd) with special events such as `dragstart`, `dragend`, and so on.\n\nThese events allow us to support special kinds of drag'n'drop, such as handling dragging a file from OS file-manager and dropping it into the browser window. Then JavaScript can access the contents of such files.\n\nBut native Drag Events also have limitations. For instance, we can't prevent dragging from a certain area. Also we can't make the dragging \"horizontal\" or \"vertical\" only. And there are many other drag'n'drop tasks that can't be done using them. Also, mobile device support for such events is very weak.\n\nSo here we'll see how to implement Drag'n'Drop using mouse events.\n\n## Drag'n'Drop algorithm\n\nThe basic Drag'n'Drop algorithm looks like this:\n\n1. On `mousedown` - prepare the element for moving, if needed (maybe create a clone of it, add a class to it or whatever).\n2. Then on `mousemove` move it by changing `left/top` with `position:absolute`.\n3. On `mouseup` - perform all actions related to finishing the drag'n'drop.\n\nThese are the basics. Later we'll see how to other features, such as highlighting current underlying elements while we drag over them.\n\nHere's the implementation of dragging a ball:\n\n```js\nball.onmousedown = function(event) { \n  // (1) prepare to moving: make absolute and on top by z-index\n  ball.style.position = 'absolute';\n  ball.style.zIndex = 1000;\n\n  // move it out of any current parents directly into body\n  // to make it positioned relative to the body\n  document.body.append(ball);  \n\n  // centers the ball at (pageX, pageY) coordinates\n  function moveAt(pageX, pageY) {\n    ball.style.left = pageX - ball.offsetWidth / 2 + 'px';\n    ball.style.top = pageY - ball.offsetHeight / 2 + 'px';\n  }\n\n  // move our absolutely positioned ball under the pointer\n  moveAt(event.pageX, event.pageY);\n\n  function onMouseMove(event) {\n    moveAt(event.pageX, event.pageY);\n  }\n\n  // (2) move the ball on mousemove\n  document.addEventListener('mousemove', onMouseMove);\n\n  // (3) drop the ball, remove unneeded handlers\n  ball.onmouseup = function() {\n    document.removeEventListener('mousemove', onMouseMove);\n    ball.onmouseup = null;\n  };\n\n};\n```\n\nIf we run the code, we can notice something strange. On the beginning of the drag'n'drop, the ball \"forks\": we start dragging its \"clone\".\n\n```online\nHere's an example in action:\n\n[iframe src=\"ball\" height=230]\n\nTry to drag'n'drop with the mouse and you'll see such behavior.\n```\n\nThat's because the browser has its own drag'n'drop support for images and some other elements. It runs automatically and conflicts with ours.\n\nTo disable it:\n\n```js\nball.ondragstart = function() {\n  return false;\n};\n```\n\nNow everything will be all right.\n\n```online\nIn action:\n\n[iframe src=\"ball2\" height=230]\n```\n\nAnother important aspect -- we track `mousemove` on `document`, not on `ball`. From the first sight it may seem that the mouse is always over the ball, and we can put `mousemove` on it.\n\nBut as we remember, `mousemove` triggers often, but not for every pixel. So after swift move the pointer can jump from the ball somewhere in the middle of document (or even outside of the window).\n\nSo we should listen on `document` to catch it.\n\n## Correct positioning\n\nIn the examples above the ball is always moved so, that it's center is under the pointer:\n\n```js\nball.style.left = pageX - ball.offsetWidth / 2 + 'px';\nball.style.top = pageY - ball.offsetHeight / 2 + 'px';\n```\n\nNot bad, but there's a side-effect. To initiate the drag'n'drop, we can `mousedown` anywhere on the ball. But if \"take\" it from its edge, then the ball suddenly \"jumps\" to become centered under the mouse pointer.\n\nIt would be better if we keep the initial shift of the element relative to the pointer.\n\nFor instance, if we start dragging by the edge of the ball, then the pointer should remain over the edge while dragging.\n\n![](ball_shift.svg)\n\nLet's update our algorithm:\n\n1. When a visitor presses the button (`mousedown`) - remember the distance from the pointer to the left-upper corner of the ball in variables `shiftX/shiftY`. We'll keep that distance while dragging.\n\n    To get these shifts we can substract the coordinates:\n\n    ```js\n    // onmousedown\n    let shiftX = event.clientX - ball.getBoundingClientRect().left;\n    let shiftY = event.clientY - ball.getBoundingClientRect().top;\n    ```\n\n2. Then while dragging we position the ball on the same shift relative to the pointer, like this:\n\n    ```js\n    // onmousemove\n    // ball has position:absoute\n    ball.style.left = event.pageX - *!*shiftX*/!* + 'px';\n    ball.style.top = event.pageY - *!*shiftY*/!* + 'px';\n    ```\n\nThe final code with better positioning:\n\n```js\nball.onmousedown = function(event) {\n\n*!*\n  let shiftX = event.clientX - ball.getBoundingClientRect().left;\n  let shiftY = event.clientY - ball.getBoundingClientRect().top;\n*/!*\n\n  ball.style.position = 'absolute';\n  ball.style.zIndex = 1000;\n  document.body.append(ball);\n\n  moveAt(event.pageX, event.pageY);\n\n  // moves the ball at (pageX, pageY) coordinates\n  // taking initial shifts into account\n  function moveAt(pageX, pageY) {\n    ball.style.left = pageX - *!*shiftX*/!* + 'px';\n    ball.style.top = pageY - *!*shiftY*/!* + 'px';\n  }\n\n  function onMouseMove(event) {\n    moveAt(event.pageX, event.pageY);\n  }\n\n  // move the ball on mousemove\n  document.addEventListener('mousemove', onMouseMove);\n\n  // drop the ball, remove unneeded handlers\n  ball.onmouseup = function() {\n    document.removeEventListener('mousemove', onMouseMove);\n    ball.onmouseup = null;\n  };\n\n};\n\nball.ondragstart = function() {\n  return false;\n};\n```\n\n```online\nIn action (inside `<iframe>`):\n\n[iframe src=\"ball3\" height=230]\n```\n\nThe difference is especially noticeable if we drag the ball by its right-bottom corner. In the previous example the ball \"jumps\" under the pointer. Now it fluently follows the pointer from the current position.\n\n## Potential drop targets (droppables)\n\nIn previous examples the ball could be dropped just \"anywhere\" to stay. In real-life we usually take one element and drop it onto another. For instance, a \"file\" into a \"folder\" or something else.\n\nSpeaking abstract, we take a \"draggable\" element and drop it onto \"droppable\" element.\n\nWe need to know:\n- where the element was dropped at the end of Drag'n'Drop -- to do the corresponding action,\n- and, preferably, know the droppable we're dragging over, to highlight it.\n\nThe solution is kind-of interesting and just a little bit tricky, so let's cover it here.\n\nWhat may be the first idea? Probably to set `mouseover/mouseup` handlers on potential droppables?\n\nBut that doesn't work.\n\nThe problem is that, while we're dragging, the draggable element is always above other elements. And mouse events only happen on the top element, not on those below it.\n\nFor instance, below are two `<div>` elements, red one on top of the blue one (fully covers). There's no way to catch an event on the blue one, because the red is on top:\n\n```html run autorun height=60\n<style>\n  div {\n    width: 50px;\n    height: 50px;\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n  }\n</style>\n<div style=\"background:blue\" onmouseover=\"alert('never works')\"></div>\n<div style=\"background:red\" onmouseover=\"alert('over red!')\"></div>\n```\n\nThe same with a draggable element. The ball is always on top over other elements, so events happen on it. Whatever handlers we set on lower elements, they won't work.\n\nThat's why the initial idea to put handlers on potential droppables doesn't work in practice. They won't run.\n\nSo, what to do?\n\nThere's a method called `document.elementFromPoint(clientX, clientY)`. It returns the most nested element on given window-relative coordinates (or `null` if given coordinates are out of the window).\n\nWe can use it in any of our mouse event handlers to detect the potential droppable under the pointer, like this:\n\n```js\n// in a mouse event handler\nball.hidden = true; // (*) hide the element that we drag\n\nlet elemBelow = document.elementFromPoint(event.clientX, event.clientY);\n// elemBelow is the element below the ball, may be droppable\n\nball.hidden = false;\n```\n\nPlease note: we need to hide the ball before the call `(*)`. Otherwise we'll usually have a ball on these coordinates, as it's the top element under the pointer: `elemBelow=ball`. So we hide it and immediately show again.\n\nWe can use that code to check what element we're \"flying over\" at any time. And handle the drop when it happens.\n\nAn extended code of `onMouseMove` to find \"droppable\" elements:\n\n```js\n// potential droppable that we're flying over right now\nlet currentDroppable = null;\n\nfunction onMouseMove(event) {\n  moveAt(event.pageX, event.pageY);\n\n  ball.hidden = true;\n  let elemBelow = document.elementFromPoint(event.clientX, event.clientY);\n  ball.hidden = false;\n\n  // mousemove events may trigger out of the window (when the ball is dragged off-screen)\n  // if clientX/clientY are out of the window, then elementFromPoint returns null\n  if (!elemBelow) return;\n\n  // potential droppables are labeled with the class \"droppable\" (can be other logic)\n  let droppableBelow = elemBelow.closest('.droppable');\n\n  if (currentDroppable != droppableBelow) {\n    // we're flying in or out...\n    // note: both values can be null\n    //   currentDroppable=null if we were not over a droppable before this event (e.g over an empty space)\n    //   droppableBelow=null if we're not over a droppable now, during this event\n\n    if (currentDroppable) {\n      // the logic to process \"flying out\" of the droppable (remove highlight)\n      leaveDroppable(currentDroppable);\n    }\n    currentDroppable = droppableBelow;\n    if (currentDroppable) {\n      // the logic to process \"flying in\" of the droppable\n      enterDroppable(currentDroppable);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the example below when the ball is dragged over the soccer gate, the gate is highlighted.\n\n[codetabs height=250 src=\"ball4\"]\n\nNow we have the current \"drop target\", that we're flying over, in the variable `currentDroppable` during the whole process and can use it to highlight or any other stuff.\n\n## Summary\n\nWe considered a basic Drag'n'Drop algorithm.\n\nThe key components:\n\n1. Events flow: `ball.mousedown` -> `document.mousemove` -> `ball.mouseup` (don't forget to cancel native `ondragstart`).\n2. At the drag start -- remember the initial shift of the pointer relative to the element: `shiftX/shiftY` and keep it during the dragging.\n3. Detect droppable elements under the pointer using `document.elementFromPoint`.\n\nWe can lay a lot on this foundation.\n\n- On `mouseup` we can intellectually finalize the drop: change data, move elements around.\n- We can highlight the elements we're flying over.\n- We can limit dragging by a certain area or direction.\n- We can use event delegation for `mousedown/up`. A large-area event handler that checks  `event.target` can manage Drag'n'Drop for hundreds of elements.\n- And so on.\n\nThere are frameworks that build architecture over it: `DragZone`, `Droppable`, `Draggable` and other classes. Most of them do the similar stuff to what's described above, so it should be easy to understand them now. Or roll your own, as you can see that that's easy enough to do, sometimes easier than adapting a third-part solution.",

        "content": "\n\nPointer events is a modern way to handle input from a variety of pointing devices, such as a mouse, a pen/stylus, a touchscreen and so on.\n\n## The brief history\n\nLet's make a small overview, so that you understand the general picture and the place of Pointer Events among other event types.\n\n- Long ago, in the past, there existed only mouse events.\n\n    Then touch devices appeared. For the old code to work, they also generate mouse events. For instance, tapping generates `mousedown`. But mouse events were not good enough, as touch devices are more powerful in many aspects. For example, it's possible to touch multiple points at once, and mouse events don't have any properties for that.\n\n- So touch events were introduced, such as `touchstart`, `touchend`, `touchmove`, that have touch-specific properties (we don't cover them in detail here, because pointer events are even better).\n\n    Still, it wasn't enough, as there are many other devices, such as pens, that have their own features. Also, writing a code that listens both touch and mouse events was cumbersome. \n\n- To solve these issues, the new standard Pointer Events was introduced. It provides a single set of events for all kinds of pointing devices.\n\nAs of now, [Pointer Events Level 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents2/) specification is supported in all major browsers, while the [Pointer Events Level 3](https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/) is in the works. Unless you code for Internet Explorer 10 or Safari 12 and below, there's no point in using mouse or touch events any more. We can switch to pointer events.\n\nThat said, there are important peculiarities, one should know them to use them correctly and avoid extra surprises.  We'll pay attention to them in this article.\n\n## Pointer event types\n\nPointer events are named similar to mouse events:\n\n| Pointer Event | Mouse event |\n|---------------|-------------|\n| `pointerdown` | `mousedown` |\n| `pointerup` | `mouseup` |\n| `pointermove` | `mousemove` |\n| `pointerover` | `mouseover` |\n| `pointerout` | `mouseout` |\n| `pointerenter` | `mouseenter` |\n| `pointerleave` | `mouseleave` |\n| `pointercancel` | - |\n| `gotpointercapture` | - |\n| `lostpointercapture` | - |\n\nAs we can see, for every `mouse<event>`, there's a `pointer<event>` that plays a similar role. Also there are 3 additional pointer events that don't have a corresponding `mouse...` counterpart, we'll soon explain about them. \n\n```smart header=\"Replacing `mouse<event>` with `pointer<event>` in our code\"\nWe can replace `mouse<event>` events with `pointer<event>` in our code and expect things to continue working fine with mouse.\n\nThe support for touch devices will also \"magically\" improve, but we'll probably need to add `touch-action: none` rule in CSS. See the details below in the section about `pointercancel`. \n```\n\n## Pointer event properties\n\nPointer events have the same properties as mouse events, such as `clientX/Y`, `target` etc, plus some extra:\n\n- `pointerId` - the unique identifier of the pointer causing the event.\n    \n    Allows to handle multiple pointers, such as a touchscreen with stylus and multi-touch (explained below).\n- `pointerType` - the pointing device type, must be a string, one of: \"mouse\", \"pen\" or \"touch\". \n\n    We can use this property to react differently on various pointer types.\n- `isPrimary` - `true` for the primary pointer (the first finger in multi-touch).\n\nFor pointers that measure a contact area and pressure, e.g. a finger on the touchscreen, the additional properties can be useful:\n\n- `width` - the width of of the area where the pointer touches the device. Where unsupported, e.g. for mouse it's always `1`. \n- `height` - the height of of the area where the pointer touches the device. Where unsupported, always `1`.\n- `pressure` - the pressure of the pointer tip, in range from 0 to 1. For devices that don't support pressure must be either `0.5` (pressed) or `0`.\n- `tangentialPressure` - the normalized tangential pressure.\n- `tiltX`, `tiltY`, `twist` - pen-specific properties that describe how the pen is positioned relative the surface.\n\nThese properties aren't very well supported across devices, so they are rarely used. You can find the details in the [specification](https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#pointerevent-interface) if needed.\n\n## Multi-touch\n\nOne of the things that mouse events totally don't support is multi-touch: a user can touch them in several places at once at their phone or tablet, perform special gestures.\n\nPointer Events allow to handle multi-touch with the help of `pointerId` and `isPrimary` properties.\n\nHere's what happens when a user touches a screen at one place, and then puts another finger somewhere else on it:\n\n1. At the first touch:\n    - `pointerdown` with `isPrimary=true` and some `pointerId`.\n2. For the second finger and further touches:\n    - `pointerdown` with `isPrimary=false` and a different `pointerId` for every finger.\n\nPlease note: there `pointerId` is assigned not to the whole device, but for each touching finger. If we use 5 fingers to simultaneously touch the screen, we have 5 `pointerdown` events with respective coordinates and different `pointerId`.\n\nThe events associated with the first finger always have `isPrimary=true`.\n\nWe can track multiple touching fingers using their `pointerId`. When the user moves move and then detouches a finger, we get `pointermove` and `pointerup` events with the same `pointerId` as we had in `pointerdown`.\n\n```online\nHere's the demo that logs `pointerdown` and `pointerup` events:\n\n[iframe src=\"multitouch\" edit height=200]\n\nPlease note: you must be using a touchscreen device, such as a phone or a tablet to actually see the difference. For single-touch devices, such as a mouse, there'll be always same `pointerId` with `isPrimary=true`, for all pointer events.\n```\n\n## Event: pointercancel\n\nWe've mentioned the importance of `touch-action: none` before. Now let's explain why, as skipping this may cause our interfaces to malfunction.\n\nThe `pointercancel` event fires when there's an ongoing pointer interaction, and then something happens that causes it to be aborted, so that no more pointer events are generated. \n\nSuch causes are: \n- The pointer device hardware was disabled.\n- The device orientation changed (tablet rotated). \n- The browser decided to handle the interaction on its own, considering it a mouse gesture or zoom-and-pan action or something else.\n\nWe'll demonstrate `pointercancel` on a practical example to see how it affects us.\n\nLet's say we're impelementing drag'n'drop for a ball, just as in the beginning of the article <info:mouse-drag-and-drop>.\n\nHere are the flow of user actions and corresponding events:\n\n1) The user presses the mouse button on an image, to start dragging\n    - `pointerdown` event fires\n2) Then they start dragging the image\n    - `pointermove` fires, maybe several times\n3) Surprise! The browser has native drag'n'drop support for images, that kicks in and takes over the drag'n'drop process, thus generating `pointercancel` event.\n    - The browser now handles drag'n'drop of the image on its own. The user may even drag the ball image out of the browser, into their Mail program or a File Manager.\n    - No more `pointermove` events for us.\n\nSo the issue is that the browser \"hijacks\" the interaction: `pointercancel` fires and no more `pointermove` events are generated.\n\n```online\nHere's the demo with pointer events (only `up/down`, `move` and `cancel`) logged in the textarea: \n\n[iframe src=\"ball\" height=240 edit]\n```\n\nWe'd like to implement our own drag'n'drop, so let's tell the browser not to take it over.\n\n**Prevent default browser actions to avoid `pointercancel`.**\n\nWe need to do two things:\n\n1. Prevent native drag'n'drop from happening:\n    - Can do it by setting `ball.ondragstart = () => false`, just as described in the article <info:mouse-drag-and-drop>.\n    - That works well for mouse events.\n2. For touch devices, there are also touch-related browser actions. We'll have problems with them too.\n    - We can prevent them by setting `#ball { touch-action: none }` in CSS. \n    - Then our code will start working on touch devices.\n\nAfter we do that, the events will work as intended, the browser won't hijack the process and emit no `pointercancel`.\n\n```online\nThis demo adds these lines:\n\n[iframe src=\"ball-2\" height=240 edit]\n\nAs you can see, there's no `pointercancel` any more.\n```\n\nNow we can add the code to actually move the ball, and our drag'n'drop will work for mouse devices and touch devices.\n\n## Pointer capturing\n\nPointer capturing is a special feature of pointer events.\n\nThe idea is that we can \"bind\" all events with a particular `pointerId` to a given element. Then all subsequent events with the same `pointerId` will be retargeted to the same element. That is: the browser sets that element as the target and trigger associated handlers, no matter where it actually happened.\n\nThe related methods are:\n- `elem.setPointerCapture(pointerId)` - binds the given `pointerId` to `elem`.\n- `elem.releasePointerCapture(pointerId)` - unbinds the given `pointerId` from `elem`.\n\nSuch binding doesn't hold long. It's automatically removed after `pointerup` or `pointercancel` events, or when the target `elem` is removed from the document. \n\nNow when do we need this?\n\n**Pointer capturing is used to simplify drag'n'drop kind of interactions.**\n\nLet's recall the problem we met while making a custom slider in the article <info:mouse-drag-and-drop>.\n\n1) First, the user presses `pointerdown` on the slider thumb to start dragging it.\n2) ...But then, as they move the pointer, it may leave the slider: go below or over it.\n\nBut we continue tracking track `pointermove` events and move the thumb until `pointerup`, even though the pointer is not on the slider any more.\n\n[Previously](info:mouse-drag-and-drop), to handle `pointermove` events that happen outside of the slider, we listened for `pointermove` events on the whole `document`. \n\nPointer capturing provides an alternative solution: we can call `thumb.setPointerCapture(event.pointerId)` in `pointerdown` handler, and then all future pointer events until `pointerup` will be retarteted to `thumb`.\n\nThat is: events handlers on `thumb` will be called, and `event.target` will always be `thumb`, even if the user moves their pointer around the whole document. So we can listen at `thumb` for `pointermove`, no matter where it happens.\n\nHere's the essential code:\n\n```js\nthumb.onpointerdown = function(event) {\n  // retarget all pointer events (until pointerup) to me\n  thumb.setPointerCapture(event.pointerId);\n};\n\nthumb.onpointermove = function(event) {\n  // move the slider: listen at thumb, as all events are retargeted to it\n  let newLeft = event.clientX - slider.getBoundingClientRect().left;\n  thumb.style.left = newLeft + 'px';\n};\n\n// note: no need to call thumb.releasePointerCapture, \n// it happens on pointerup automatically\n```\n\n```online\nThe full demo:\n\n[iframe src=\"slider\" height=100 edit]\n```\n\n**As a summary: the code becomes cleaner as we don't need to add/remove handlers on the whole `document` any more. That's what pointer capturing does.**\n\nThere are two associated pointer events:\n\n- `gotpointercapture` fires when an element uses `setPointerCapture` to enable capturing.\n- `lostpointercapture` fires when the capture is released: either explicitly with `releasePointerCapture` call, or automatically on `pointerup`/`pointercancel`.\n\n## Summary\n\nPointer events allow to handle mouse, touch and pen events simultaneously.\n\nPointer events extend mouse events. We can replace `mouse` with `pointer` in event names and expect our code to continue working for mouse, with better support for other device types.\n\nRemember to set `touch-events: none` in CSS for elements that we engage, otherwise the browser hijacks many types of touch interactions and pointer events won't be generated.\n\nAdditional abilities of Pointer events are:\n\n- Multi-touch support using `pointerId` and `isPrimary`.\n- Device-specific properties, such as `pressure`, `width/height` and others.\n- Pointer capturing: we can retarget all pointer events to a specific element until `pointerup`/`pointercancel`.\n\nAs of now, pointer events are supported in all major browsers, so we can safely switch to them, if IE10- and Safari 12- are not needed. And even with those browsers, there are polyfills that enable the support of pointer events.",

        "content": "\n\nBefore we get to keyboard, please note that on modern devices there are other ways to \"input something\". For instance, people use speech recognition (especially on mobile devices) or copy/paste with the mouse.\n\nSo if we want to track any input into an `<input>` field, then keyboard events are not enough. There's another event named `input` to track changes of an `<input>` field, by any means. And it may be a better choice for such task. We'll cover it later in the chapter <info:events-change-input>.\n\nKeyboard events should be used when we want to handle keyboard actions (virtual keyboard also counts). For instance, to react on arrow keys `key:Up` and `key:Down` or hotkeys (including combinations of keys).\n\n\n## Teststand [#keyboard-test-stand]\n\n```offline\nTo better understand keyboard events, you can use the [teststand](sandbox:keyboard-dump).\n```\n\n```online\nTo better understand keyboard events, you can use the teststand below.\n\nTry different key combinations in the text field.\n\n[codetabs src=\"keyboard-dump\" height=480]\n```\n\n\n## Keydown and keyup\n\nThe `keydown` events happens when a key is pressed down, and then `keyup` -- when it's released.\n\n### event.code and event.key\n\nThe `key` property of the event object allows to get the character, while the `code` property of the event object allows to get the \"physical key code\".\n\nFor instance, the same key `key:Z` can be pressed with or without `key:Shift`. That gives us two different characters: lowercase `z` and uppercase `Z`.\n\nThe `event.key` is exactly the character, and it will be different. But `event.code` is the same:\n\n| Key          | `event.key` | `event.code` |\n|--------------|-------------|--------------|\n| `key:Z`      |`z` (lowercase)         |`KeyZ`        |\n| `key:Shift+Z`|`Z` (uppercase)          |`KeyZ`        |\n\n\nIf a user works with different languages, then switching to another language would make a totally different character instead of `\"Z\"`. That will become the value of `event.key`, while `event.code` is always the same: `\"KeyZ\"`.\n\n```smart header=\"\\\"KeyZ\\\" and other key codes\"\nEvery key has the code that depends on its location on the keyboard. Key codes described in the [UI Events code specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/).\n\nFor instance:\n- Letter keys have codes `\"Key<letter>\"`: `\"KeyA\"`, `\"KeyB\"` etc.\n- Digit keys have codes: `\"Digit<number>\"`: `\"Digit0\"`, `\"Digit1\"` etc.\n- Special keys are coded by their names: `\"Enter\"`, `\"Backspace\"`, `\"Tab\"` etc.\n\nThere are several widespread keyboard layouts, and the specification gives key codes for each of them.\n\nRead the [alphanumeric section of the spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/#key-alphanumeric-section) for more codes, or just press a key in the [teststand](#keyboard-test-stand) above.\n```\n\n```warn header=\"Case matters: `\\\"KeyZ\\\"`, not `\\\"keyZ\\\"`\"\nSeems obvious, but people still make mistakes.\n\nPlease evade mistypes: it's `KeyZ`, not `keyZ`. The check like `event.code==\"keyZ\"` won't work: the first letter of `\"Key\"` must be uppercase.\n```\n\nWhat if a key does not give any character? For instance, `key:Shift` or `key:F1` or others. For those keys, `event.key` is approximately the same as `event.code`:\n\n| Key          | `event.key` | `event.code` |\n|--------------|-------------|--------------|\n| `key:F1`      |`F1`          |`F1`        |\n| `key:Backspace`      |`Backspace`          |`Backspace`        |\n| `key:Shift`|`Shift`          |`ShiftRight` or `ShiftLeft`        |\n\nPlease note that `event.code` specifies exactly which key is pressed. For instance, most keyboards have two `key:Shift` keys: on the left and on the right side. The `event.code` tells us exactly which one was pressed, and `event.key` is responsible for the \"meaning\" of the key: what it is (a \"Shift\").\n\nLet's say, we want to handle a hotkey: `key:Ctrl+Z` (or `key:Cmd+Z` for Mac). Most text editors hook the \"Undo\" action on it. We can set a listener on `keydown` and check which key is pressed.\n\nThere's a dilemma here: in such a listener, should we check the value of `event.key` or `event.code`?\n\nOn one hand, the value of `event.key` is a character, it changes depending on the language. If the visitor has several languages in OS and switches between them, the same key gives different characters. So it makes sense to check `event.code`, it's always the same.\n\nLike this:\n\n```js run\ndocument.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {\n  if (event.code == 'KeyZ' && (event.ctrlKey || event.metaKey)) {\n    alert('Undo!')\n  }\n});\n```\n\nOn the other hand, there's a problem with `event.code`. For different keyboard layouts, the same key may have different characters.\n\nFor example, here are US layout (\"QWERTY\") and German layout (\"QWERTZ\") under it (from Wikipedia):\n\n![](us-layout.svg)\n\n![](german-layout.svg)\n\nFor the same key, US layout has \"Z\", while German layout has \"Y\" (letters are swapped).\n\nLiterally, `event.code` will equal `KeyZ` for people with German layout when they press `key:Y`.\n\nIf we check `event.code == 'KeyZ'` in our code, then for people with German layout such test will pass when they press `key:Y`.\n\nThat sounds really odd, but so it is. The [specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/#table-key-code-alphanumeric-writing-system) explicitly mentions such behavior.\n\nSo, `event.code` may match a wrong character for unexpected layout. Same letters in different layouts may map to different physical keys, leading to different codes. Luckily, that happens only with several codes, e.g. `keyA`, `keyQ`, `keyZ` (as we've seen), and doesn't happen with special keys such as `Shift`. You can find the list in the [specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/#table-key-code-alphanumeric-writing-system).\n\nTo reliably track layout-dependent characters, `event.key` may be a better way.\n\nOn the other hand, `event.code` has the benefit of staying always the same, bound to the physical key location, even if the visitor changes languages. So hotkeys that rely on it work well even in case of a language switch.\n\nDo we want to handle layout-dependant keys? Then `event.key` is the way to go.\n\nOr we want a hotkey to work even after a language switch? Then `event.code` may be better.\n\n## Auto-repeat\n\nIf a key is being pressed for a long enough time, it starts to \"auto-repeat\": the `keydown` triggers again and again, and then when it's released we finally get `keyup`. So it's kind of normal to have many `keydown` and a single `keyup`.\n\nFor events triggered by auto-repeat, the event object has `event.repeat` property set to `true`.\n\n\n## Default actions\n\nDefault actions vary, as there are many possible things that may be initiated by the keyboard.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- A character appears on the screen (the most obvious outcome).\n- A character is deleted (`key:Delete` key).\n- The page is scrolled (`key:PageDown` key).\n- The browser opens the \"Save Page\" dialog (`key:Ctrl+S`)\n-  ...and so on.\n\nPreventing the default action on `keydown` can cancel most of them, with the exception of OS-based special keys. For instance, on Windows `key:Alt+F4` closes the current browser window. And there's no way to stop it by preventing the default action in JavaScript.\n\nFor instance, the `<input>` below expects a phone number, so it does not accept keys except digits, `+`, `()` or `-`:\n\n```html autorun height=60 run\n<script>\nfunction checkPhoneKey(key) {\n  return (key >= '0' && key <= '9') || key == '+' || key == '(' || key == ')' || key == '-';\n}\n</script>\n<input *!*onkeydown=\"return checkPhoneKey(event.key)\"*/!* placeholder=\"Phone, please\" type=\"tel\">\n```\n\nPlease note that special keys, such as `key:Backspace`, `key:Left`, `key:Right`, `key:Ctrl+V`, do not work in the input. That's a side-effect of the strict filter `checkPhoneKey`.\n\nLet's relax it a little bit:\n\n\n```html autorun height=60 run\n<script>\nfunction checkPhoneKey(key) {\n  return (key >= '0' && key <= '9') || key == '+' || key == '(' || key == ')' || key == '-' ||\n    key == 'ArrowLeft' || key == 'ArrowRight' || key == 'Delete' || key == 'Backspace';\n}\n</script>\n<input onkeydown=\"return checkPhoneKey(event.key)\" placeholder=\"Phone, please\" type=\"tel\">\n```\n\nNow arrows and deletion works well.\n\n...But we still can enter anything by using a mouse and right-click + Paste. So the filter is not 100% reliable. We can just let it be like that, because most of time it works. Or an alternative approach would be to track the `input` event -- it triggers after any modification. There we can check the new value and highlight/modify it when it's invalid.\n\n## Legacy\n\nIn the past, there was a `keypress` event, and also `keyCode`, `charCode`, `which` properties of the event object.\n\nThere were so many browser incompatibilities while working with them, that developers of the specification had no way, other than deprecating all of them and creating new, modern events (described above in this chapter). The old code still works, as browsers keep supporting them, but there's totally no need to use those any more.\n\n## Summary\n\nPressing a key always generates a keyboard event, be it symbol keys or special keys like `key:Shift` or `key:Ctrl` and so on. The only exception is `key:Fn` key that sometimes presents on a laptop keyboard. There's no keyboard event for it, because it's often implemented on lower level than OS.\n\nKeyboard events:\n\n- `keydown` -- on pressing the key (auto-repeats if the key is pressed for long),\n- `keyup` -- on releasing the key.\n\nMain keyboard event properties:\n\n- `code` -- the \"key code\" (`\"KeyA\"`, `\"ArrowLeft\"` and so on), specific to the physical location of the key on keyboard.\n- `key` -- the character (`\"A\"`, `\"a\"` and so on), for non-character keys, such as `key:Esc`, usually has the same value  as `code`.\n\nIn the past, keyboard events were sometimes used to track user input in form fields. That's not reliable, because the input can come from various sources. We have `input` and `change` events to handle any input (covered later in the chapter <info:events-change-input>). They trigger after any kind of input, including copy-pasting or speech recognition.\n\nWe should use keyboard events when we really want keyboard. For example, to react on hotkeys or special keys.",

The lowest limit of the `bottom` coordinate is the window height (we assumed it to be `600`), we can't scroll it any more up.\n\nWe can obtain the window height as `document.documentElement.clientHeight`.\n\nFor our task, we need to know when the document bottom is not no more than `100px` away from it (that is: `600-700px`, if the height is `600`).\n\nSo here's the function:\n\n```js\nfunction populate() {\n  while(true) {\n    // document bottom\n    let windowRelativeBottom = document.documentElement.getBoundingClientRect().bottom;\n\n    // if the user scrolled far enough (<100px to the end)\n    if (windowRelativeBottom < document.documentElement.clientHeight + 100) {\n      // let's add more data\n      document.body.insertAdjacentHTML(\"beforeend\", `<p>Date: ${new Date()}</p>`);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

        "content": "\n\nForms and control elements, such as `<input>` have a lot of special properties and events.\n\nWorking with forms will be much more convenient when we learn them.\n\n## Navigation: form and elements\n\nDocument forms are members of the special collection `document.forms`.\n\nThat's a so-called \"named collection\": it's both named and ordered. We can use both the name or the number in the document to get the form.\n\n```js no-beautify\ndocument.forms.my - the form with name=\"my\"\ndocument.forms[0] - the first form in the document\n```\n\nWhen we have a form, then any element is available in the named collection `form.elements`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run height=40\n<form name=\"my\">\n  <input name=\"one\" value=\"1\">\n  <input name=\"two\" value=\"2\">\n</form>\n\n<script>\n  // get the form\n  let form = document.forms.my; // <form name=\"my\"> element\n\n  // get the element\n  let elem = form.elements.one; // <input name=\"one\"> element\n\n  alert(elem.value); // 1\n</script>\n```\n\nThere may be multiple elements with the same name, that's often the case with radio buttons.\n\nIn that case `form.elements[name]` is a collection, for instance:\n\n```html run height=40\n<form>\n  <input type=\"radio\" *!*name=\"age\"*/!* value=\"10\">\n  <input type=\"radio\" *!*name=\"age\"*/!* value=\"20\">\n</form>\n\n<script>\nlet form = document.forms[0];\n\nlet ageElems = form.elements.age;\n\n*!*\nalert(ageElems[0]); // [object HTMLInputElement]\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\nThese navigation properties do not depend on the tag structure. All control elements, no matter how deep they are in the form, are available in `form.elements`.\n\n\n````smart header=\"Fieldsets as \\\"subforms\\\"\"\nA form may have one or many `<fieldset>` elements inside it. They also have `elements` property that lists form controls inside them.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run height=80\n<body>\n  <form id=\"form\">\n    <fieldset name=\"userFields\">\n      <legend>info</legend>\n      <input name=\"login\" type=\"text\">\n    </fieldset>\n  </form>\n\n  <script>\n    alert(form.elements.login); // <input name=\"login\">\n\n*!*\n    let fieldset = form.elements.userFields;\n    alert(fieldset); // HTMLFieldSetElement\n\n    // we can get the input by name both from the form and from the fieldset\n    alert(fieldset.elements.login == form.elements.login); // true\n*/!*\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n````\n\n````warn header=\"Shorter notation: `form.name`\"\nThere's a shorter notation: we can access the element as `form[index/name]`.\n\nIn other words, instead of `form.elements.login` we can write `form.login`.\n\nThat also works, but there's a minor issue: if we access an element, and then change its `name`, then it is still available under the old name (as well as under the new one).\n\nThat's easy to see in an example:\n\n```html run height=40\n<form id=\"form\">\n  <input name=\"login\">\n</form>\n\n<script>\n  alert(form.elements.login == form.login); // true, the same <input>\n\n  form.login.name = \"username\"; // change the name of the input\n\n  // form.elements updated the name:\n  alert(form.elements.login); // undefined\n  alert(form.elements.username); // input\n\n*!*\n  // form allows both names: the new one and the old one\n  alert(form.username == form.login); // true\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\nThat's usually not a problem, because we rarely change names of form elements.\n\n````\n\n## Backreference: element.form\n\nFor any element, the form is available as `element.form`. So a form references all elements, and elements reference the form.\n\nHere's the picture:\n\n![](form-navigation.svg)\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run height=40\n<form id=\"form\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"login\">\n</form>\n\n<script>\n*!*\n  // form -> element\n  let login = form.login;\n\n  // element -> form\n  alert(login.form); // HTMLFormElement\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\n## Form elements\n\nLet's talk about form controls.\n\n### input and textarea\n\nWe can access their value as `input.value` (string) or `input.checked` (boolean) for checkboxes.\n\nLike this:\n\n```js\ninput.value = \"New value\";\ntextarea.value = \"New text\";\n\ninput.checked = true; // for a checkbox or radio button\n```\n\n```warn header=\"Use `textarea.value`, not `textarea.innerHTML`\"\nPlease note that even though `<textarea>...</textarea>` holds its value as nested HTML, we should never use `textarea.innerHTML` to access it.\n\nIt stores only the HTML that was initially on the page, not the current value.\n```\n\n### select and option\n\nA `<select>` element has 3 important properties:\n\n1. `select.options` -- the collection of `<option>` subelements,\n2. `select.value` -- the value of the currently selected `<option>`,\n3. `select.selectedIndex` -- the number of the currently selected `<option>`.\n\nThey provide three different ways of setting a value for a `<select>`:\n\n1. Find the corresponding `<option>` element and set `option.selected` to `true`.\n2. Set `select.value` to the value.\n3. Set `select.selectedIndex` to the number of the option.\n\nThe first way is the most obvious, but `(2)` and `(3)` are usually more convenient.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```html run\n<select id=\"select\">\n  <option value=\"apple\">Apple</option>\n  <option value=\"pear\">Pear</option>\n  <option value=\"banana\">Banana</option>\n</select>\n\n<script>\n  // all three lines do the same thing\n  select.options[2].selected = true;\n  select.selectedIndex = 2;\n  select.value = 'banana';\n</script>\n```\n\nUnlike most other controls, `<select>` allows to select multiple options at once if it has `multiple` attribute. That's feature is rarely used. In that case we need to use the first way: add/remove the `selected` property from `<option>` subelements.\n\nWe can get their collection as `select.options`, for instance:\n\n```html run\n<select id=\"select\" *!*multiple*/!*>\n  <option value=\"blues\" selected>Blues</option>\n  <option value=\"rock\" selected>Rock</option>\n  <option value=\"classic\">Classic</option>\n</select>\n\n<script>\n  // get all selected values from multi-select\n  let selected = Array.from(select.options)\n    .filter(option => option.selected)\n    .map(option => option.value);\n\n  alert(selected); // blues,rock  \n</script>\n```\n\nThe full specification of the `<select>` element is available in the specification <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#the-select-element>.\n\n### new Option\n\nThis is rarely used on its own. But there's still an interesting thing.\n\nIn the [specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#the-option-element) there's a nice short syntax to create `<option>` elements:\n\n```js\noption = new Option(text, value, defaultSelected, selected);\n```\n\nParameters:\n\n- `text` -- the text inside the option,\n- `value` -- the option value,\n- `defaultSelected` -- if `true`, then `selected` HTML-attribute is created,\n- `selected` -- if `true`, then the option is selected.\n\nThere may be a small confusion about `defaultSelected` and `selected`. That's simple: `defaultSelected` sets HTML-attribute, that we can get using `option.getAttribute('selected')`. And `selected` - whether the option is selected or not, that's more important. Usually both values are either set to `true` or not set (same as `false`).\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js\nlet option = new Option(\"Text\", \"value\");\n// creates <option value=\"value\">Text</option>\n```\n\nThe same element selected:\n\n```js\nlet option = new Option(\"Text\", \"value\", true, true);\n```\n\nOption elements have properties:\n\n`option.selected`\n: Is the option selected.\n\n`option.index`\n: The number of the option among the others in its `<select>`.\n\n`option.text`\n: Text content of the option (seen by the visitor).\n\n## References\n\n- Specification: <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html>.\n\n## Summary\n\nForm navigation:\n\n`document.forms`\n: A form is available as `document.forms[name/index]`.\n\n`form.elements`  \n: Form elements are available as `form.elements[name/index]`, or can use just `form[name/index]`. The `elements` property also works for `<fieldset>`.\n\n`element.form`\n: Elements reference their form in the `form` property.\n\nValue is available as `input.value`, `textarea.value`, `select.value` etc, or `input.checked` for checkboxes and radio buttons.\n\nFor `<select>` we can also get the value by the index `select.selectedIndex` or through the options collection `select.options`.\n\nThese are the basics to start working with forms. We'll meet many examples further in the tutorial.\n\nIn the next chapter we'll cover `focus` and `blur` events that may occur on any element, but are mostly handled on forms.",

        "content": "\n\nAn element receives a focus when the user either clicks on it or uses the `key:Tab` key on the keyboard. There's also an `autofocus` HTML attribute that puts the focus into an element by default when a page loads and other means of getting a focus.\n\nFocusing on an element generally means: \"prepare to accept the data here\", so that's the moment when we can run the code to initialize the required functionality.\n\nThe moment of losing the focus (\"blur\") can be even more important. That's when a user clicks somewhere else or presses `key:Tab` to go to the next form field, or there are other means as well.\n\nLosing the focus generally means: \"the data has been entered\", so we can run the code to check it or even to save it to the server and so on.\n\nThere are important peculiarities when working with focus events. We'll do the best to cover them further on.\n\n## Events focus/blur\n\nThe `focus` event is called on focusing, and `blur` -- when the element loses the focus.\n\nLet's use them for validation of an input field.\n\nIn the example below:\n\n- The `blur` handler checks if the field the email is entered, and if not -- shows an error.\n- The `focus` handler hides the error message (on `blur` it will be checked again):\n\n```html run autorun height=60\n<style>\n  .invalid { border-color: red; }\n  #error { color: red }\n</style>\n\nYour email please: <input type=\"email\" id=\"input\">\n\n<div id=\"error\"></div>\n\n<script>\n*!*input.onblur*/!* = function() {\n  if (!input.value.includes('@')) { // not email\n    input.classList.add('invalid');\n    error.innerHTML = 'Please enter a correct email.'\n  }\n};\n\n*!*input.onfocus*/!* = function() {\n  if (this.classList.contains('invalid')) {\n    // remove the \"error\" indication, because the user wants to re-enter something\n    this.classList.remove('invalid');\n    error.innerHTML = \"\";\n  }\n};\n</script>\n```\n\nModern HTML allows us to do many validations using input attributes: `required`, `pattern` and so on. And sometimes they are just what we need. JavaScript can be used when we want more flexibility. Also we could automatically send the changed value to the server if it's correct.\n\n\n## Methods focus/blur\n\nMethods `elem.focus()` and `elem.blur()` set/unset the focus on the element.\n\nFor instance, let's make the visitor unable to leave the input if the value is invalid:\n\n```html run autorun height=80\n<style>\n  .error {\n    background: red;\n  }\n</style>\n\nYour email please: <input type=\"email\" id=\"input\">\n<input type=\"text\" style=\"width:220px\" placeholder=\"make email invalid and try to focus here\">\n\n<script>\n  input.onblur = function() {\n    if (!this.value.includes('@')) { // not email\n      // show the error\n      this.classList.add(\"error\");\n*!*\n      // ...and put the focus back\n      input.focus();\n*/!*\n    } else {\n      this.classList.remove(\"error\");\n    }\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\nIt works in all browsers except Firefox ([bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53579)).\n\nIf we enter something into the input and then try to use `key:Tab` or click away from the `<input>`, then `onblur` returns the focus back.\n\nPlease note that we can't \"prevent losing focus\" by calling `event.preventDefault()` in `onblur`, because `onblur` works *after* the element lost the focus.\n\n```warn header=\"JavaScript-initiated focus loss\"\nA focus loss can occur for many reasons.\n\nOne of them is when the visitor clicks somewhere else. But also JavaScript itself may cause it, for instance:\n\n- An `alert` moves focus to itself, so it causes the focus loss at the element (`blur` event), and when the `alert` is dismissed, the focus comes back (`focus` event).\n- If an element is removed from DOM, then it also causes the focus loss. If it is reinserted later, then the focus doesn't return.\n\nThese features sometimes cause `focus/blur` handlers to misbehave -- to trigger when they are not needed.\n\nThe best recipe is to be careful when using these events. If we want to track user-initiated focus-loss, then we should avoid causing it ourselves.\n```\n## Allow focusing on any element: tabindex\n\nBy default many elements do not support focusing.\n\nThe list varies a bit between browsers, but one thing is always correct: `focus/blur` support is guaranteed for elements that a visitor can interact with: `<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<a>` and so on.\n\nFrom the other hand, elements that exist to format something, such as `<div>`, `<span>`, `<table>` -- are unfocusable by default. The method `elem.focus()` doesn't work on them, and `focus/blur` events are never triggered.\n\nThis can be changed using HTML-attribute `tabindex`.\n\nAny element becomes focusable if it has `tabindex`. The value of the attribute is the order number of the element when `key:Tab` (or something like that) is used to switch between them.\n\nThat is: if we have two elements, the first has `tabindex=\"1\"`, and the second has `tabindex=\"2\"`, then pressing `key:Tab` while in the first element -- moves the focus into the second one.\n\nThe switch order is: elements with `tabindex` from `1` and above go first (in the `tabindex` order), and then elements without `tabindex` (e.g. a regular `<input>`).\n\nElements with matching `tabindex` are switched in the document source order (the default order).\n\nThere are two special values:\n\n- `tabindex=\"0\"` puts an element among those without `tabindex`. That is, when we switch elements, elements with `tabindex=0` go after elements with `tabindex ≥ 1`.\n\n    Usually it's used to make an element focusable, but keep the default switching order. To make an element a part of the form on par with `<input>`.\n\n- `tabindex=\"-1\"` allows only programmatic focusing on an element. The `key:Tab` key ignores such elements, but method `elem.focus()` works.\n\nFor instance, here's a list. Click the first item and press `key:Tab`:\n\n```html autorun no-beautify\nClick the first item and press Tab. Keep track of the order. Please note that many subsequent Tabs can move the focus out of the iframe with the example.\n<ul>\n  <li tabindex=\"1\">One</li>\n  <li tabindex=\"0\">Zero</li>\n  <li tabindex=\"2\">Two</li>\n  <li tabindex=\"-1\">Minus one</li>\n</ul>\n\n<style>\n  li { cursor: pointer; }\n  :focus { outline: 1px dashed green; }\n</style>\n```\n\nThe order is like this: `1 - 2 - 0`. Normally, `<li>` does not support focusing, but `tabindex` full enables it, along with events and styling with `:focus`.\n\n```smart header=\"The property `elem.tabIndex` works too\"\nWe can add `tabindex` from JavaScript by using the `elem.tabIndex` property. That has the same effect.\n```\n\n## Delegation: focusin/focusout\n\nEvents `focus` and `blur` do not bubble.\n\nFor instance, we can't put `onfocus` on the `<form>` to highlight it, like this:\n\n```html autorun height=80\n<!-- on focusing in the form -- add the class -->\n<form *!*onfocus=\"this.className='focused'\"*/!*>\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" value=\"Name\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"surname\" value=\"Surname\">\n</form>\n\n<style> .focused { outline: 1px solid red; } </style>\n```\n\nThe example above doesn't work, because when user focuses on an `<input>`, the `focus` event triggers on that input only. It doesn't bubble up. So `form.onfocus` never triggers.\n\nThere are two solutions.\n\nFirst, there's a funny historical feature: `focus/blur` do not bubble up, but propagate down on the capturing phase.\n\nThis will work:\n\n```html autorun height=80\n<form id=\"form\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" value=\"Name\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"surname\" value=\"Surname\">\n</form>\n\n<style> .focused { outline: 1px solid red; } </style>\n\n<script>\n*!*\n  // put the handler on capturing phase (last argument true)\n  form.addEventListener(\"focus\", () => form.classList.add('focused'), true);\n  form.addEventListener(\"blur\", () => form.classList.remove('focused'), true);\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\nSecond, there are `focusin` and `focusout` events -- exactly the same as `focus/blur`, but they bubble.\n\nNote that they must be assigned using `elem.addEventListener`, not `on<event>`.\n\nSo here's another working variant:\n\n```html autorun height=80\n<form id=\"form\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" value=\"Name\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"surname\" value=\"Surname\">\n</form>\n\n<style> .focused { outline: 1px solid red; } </style>\n\n<script>\n*!*\n  form.addEventListener(\"focusin\", () => form.classList.add('focused'));\n  form.addEventListener(\"focusout\", () => form.classList.remove('focused'));\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nEvents `focus` and `blur` trigger on focusing/losing focus on the element.\n\nTheir specials are:\n- They do not bubble. Can use capturing state instead or `focusin/focusout`.\n- Most elements do not support focus by default. Use `tabindex` to make anything focusable.\n\nThe current focused element is available as `document.activeElement`.",

But when we move the focus somewhere else, for instance, click on a button -- there will be a `change` event:\n\n```html autorun height=40 run\n<input type=\"text\" onchange=\"alert(this.value)\">\n<input type=\"button\" value=\"Button\">\n```\n\nFor other elements: `select`, `input type=checkbox/radio` it triggers right after the selection changes:\n\n```html autorun height=40 run\n<select onchange=\"alert(this.value)\">\n  <option value=\"\">Select something</option>\n  <option value=\"1\">Option 1</option>\n  <option value=\"2\">Option 2</option>\n  <option value=\"3\">Option 3</option>\n</select>\n```\n\n\n## Event: input\n\nThe `input` event triggers every time after a value is modified by the user.\n\nUnlike keyboard events, it triggers on any value change, even those that does not involve keyboard actions: pasting with a mouse or using speech recognition to dictate the text.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html autorun height=40 run\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"input\"> oninput: <span id=\"result\"></span>\n<script>\n  input.oninput = function() {\n    result.innerHTML = input.value;\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\nIf we want to handle every modification of an `<input>` then this event is the best choice.\n\nOn the other hand, `input` event doesn't trigger on keyboard input and other actions that do not involve value change, e.g. pressing arrow keys `key:⇦` `key:⇨` while in the input.\n\n```smart header=\"Can't prevent anything in `oninput`\"\nThe `input` event occurs after the value is modified.\n\nSo we can't use `event.preventDefault()` there -- it's just too late, there would be no effect.\n```\n\n## Events: cut, copy, paste\n\nThese events occur on cutting/copying/pasting a value.\n\nThey belong to [ClipboardEvent](https://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis/#clipboard-event-interfaces) class and provide access to the data that is copied/pasted.\n\nWe also can use `event.preventDefault()` to abort the action, then nothing gets copied/pasted.\n\nFor instance, the code below prevents all such events and shows what we are trying to cut/copy/paste:\n\n```html autorun height=40 run\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"input\">\n<script>\n  input.oncut = input.oncopy = input.onpaste = function(event) {\n    alert(event.type + ' - ' + event.clipboardData.getData('text/plain'));\n    return false;\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\nPlease note, that it's possible to copy/paste not just text, but everything. For instance, we can copy a file in the OS file manager, and paste it.\n\nThere's a list of methods [in the specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis/#dfn-datatransfer) that can work with different data types including files, read/write to the clipboard.\n\nBut please note that clipboard is a \"global\" OS-level thing. Most browsers allow read/write access to the clipboard only in the scope of certain user actions for the safety, e.g. in `onclick` event handlers.\n\nAlso it's forbidden to generate \"custom\" clipboard events with `dispatchEvent` in all browsers except Firefox.\n\n## Summary\n\nData change events:\n\n| Event | Description | Specials |\n|---------|----------|-------------|\n| `change`| A value was changed. | For text inputs triggers on focus loss. |\n| `input` | For text inputs on every change. | Triggers immediately unlike `change`. |\n| `cut/copy/paste` | Cut/copy/paste actions. | The action can be prevented.

We can use it to dynamically create and send our own forms to server.\n\nLet's see more details of them.\n\n## Event: submit\n\nThere are two main ways to submit a form:\n\n1. The first -- to click `<input type=\"submit\">` or `<input type=\"image\">`.\n2. The second -- press `key:Enter` on an input field.\n\nBoth actions lead to `submit` event on the form. The handler can check the data, and if there are errors, show them and call `event.preventDefault()`, then the form won't be sent to the server.\n\nIn the form below:\n1. Go into the text field and press `key:Enter`.\n2. Click `<input type=\"submit\">`.\n\nBoth actions show `alert` and the form is not sent anywhere due to `return false`:\n\n```html autorun height=60 no-beautify\n<form onsubmit=\"alert('submit!');return false\">\n  First: Enter in the input field <input type=\"text\" value=\"text\"><br>\n  Second: Click \"submit\": <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n</form>\n```\n\n````smart header=\"Relation between `submit` and `click`\"\nWhen a form is sent using `key:Enter` on an input field, a `click` event triggers on the `<input type=\"submit\">`.\n\nThat's rather funny, because there was no click at all.\n\nHere's the demo:\n```html autorun height=60\n<form onsubmit=\"return false\">\n <input type=\"text\" size=\"30\" value=\"Focus here and press enter\">\n <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" *!*onclick=\"alert('click')\"*/!*>\n</form>\n```\n\n````\n\n## Method: submit\n\nTo submit a form to the server manually, we can call `form.submit()`.\n\nThen the `submit` event is not generated. It is assumed that if the programmer calls `form.submit()`, then the script already did all related processing.\n\nSometimes that's used to manually create and send a form, like this:\n\n```js run\nlet form = document.createElement('form');\nform.action = 'https://google.com/search';\nform.method = 'GET';\n\nform.innerHTML = '<input name=\"q\" value=\"test\">';\n\n// the form must be in the document to submit it\ndocument.body.append(form);\n\nform.submit();\n```",

        "content": "\n\nThe lifecycle of an HTML page has three important events:\n\n- `DOMContentLoaded` -- the browser fully loaded HTML, and the DOM tree is built, but external resources like pictures `<img>` and stylesheets may be not yet loaded.  \n- `load` -- not only HTML is loaded, but also all the external resources: images, styles etc.\n- `beforeunload/unload` -- the user is leaving the page.\n\nEach event may be useful:\n\n- `DOMContentLoaded` event -- DOM is ready, so the handler can lookup DOM nodes, initialize the interface.\n- `load` event -- external resources are loaded, so styles are applied, image sizes are known etc.\n- `beforeunload` event -- the user is leaving: we can check if the user saved the changes and ask them whether they really want to leave.\n- `unload` -- the user almost left, but we still can initiate some operations, such as sending out statistics.\n\nLet's explore the details of these events.\n\n## DOMContentLoaded\n\nThe `DOMContentLoaded` event happens on the `document` object.\n\nWe must use `addEventListener` to catch it:\n\n```js\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", ready);\n// not \"document.onDOMContentLoaded = ...\"\n```\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run height=200 refresh\n<script>\n  function ready() {\n    alert('DOM is ready');\n\n    // image is not yet loaded (unless was cached), so the size is 0x0\n    alert(`Image size: ${img.offsetWidth}x${img.offsetHeight}`);\n  }\n\n*!*\n  document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", ready);\n*/!*\n</script>\n\n<img id=\"img\" src=\"https://en.js.cx/clipart/train.gif?speed=1&cache=0\">\n```\n\nIn the example the `DOMContentLoaded` handler runs when the document is loaded, so it can see all the elements, including `<img>` below.\n\nBut it doesn't wait for the image to load. So `alert` shows zero sizes.\n\nAt first sight, the `DOMContentLoaded` event is very simple. The DOM tree is ready -- here's the event. There are few peculiarities though.\n\n### DOMContentLoaded and scripts\n\nWhen the browser processes an HTML-document and comes across a `<script>` tag, it needs to execute before continuing building the DOM. That's a precaution, as scripts may want to modify DOM, and even `document.write` into it, so `DOMContentLoaded` has to wait.\n\nSo DOMContentLoaded definitely happens after such scripts:\n\n```html run\n<script>\n  document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", () => {\n    alert(\"DOM ready!\");\n  });\n</script>\n\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.3.0/lodash.js\"></script>\n\n<script>\n  alert(\"Library loaded, inline script executed\");\n</script>\n```\n\nIn the example above, we first see \"Library loaded...\", and then \"DOM ready!\" (all scripts are executed).\n\n```warn header=\"Scripts that don't block DOMContentLoaded\"\nThere are two exceptions from this rule:\n1. Scripts with the `async` attribute, that we'll cover [a bit later](info:script-async-defer), don't block `DOMContentLoaded`.\n2. Scripts that are generated dynamically with `document.createElement('script')` and then added to the webpage also don't block this event.\n```\n\n### DOMContentLoaded and styles\n\nExternal style sheets don't affect DOM, so `DOMContentLoaded` does not wait for them.\n\nBut there's a pitfall. If we have a script after the style, then that script must wait until the stylesheet loads:\n\n```html run\n<link type=\"text/css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">\n<script>\n  // the script doesn't not execute until the stylesheet is loaded\n  alert(getComputedStyle(document.body).marginTop);\n</script>\n```\n\nThe reason for this is that the script may want to get coordinates and other style-dependent properties of elements, like in the example above. Naturally, it has to wait for styles to load.\n\nAs `DOMContentLoaded` waits for scripts, it now waits for styles before them as well.\n\n### Built-in browser autofill\n\nFirefox, Chrome and Opera autofill forms on `DOMContentLoaded`.\n\nFor instance, if the page has a form with login and password, and the browser remembered the values, then on `DOMContentLoaded` it may try to autofill them (if approved by the user).\n\nSo if `DOMContentLoaded` is postponed by long-loading scripts, then autofill also awaits. You probably saw that on some sites (if you use browser autofill) -- the login/password fields don't get autofilled immediately, but there's a delay till the page fully loads. That's actually the delay until the `DOMContentLoaded` event.\n\n\n## window.onload [#window-onload]\n\nThe `load` event on the `window` object triggers when the whole page is loaded including styles, images and other resources. This event is available via the `onload` property.\n\nThe example below correctly shows image sizes, because `window.onload` waits for all images:\n\n```html run height=200 refresh\n<script>\n  window.onload = function() { // same as window.addEventListener('load', (event) => {\n    alert('Page loaded');\n\n    // image is loaded at this time\n    alert(`Image size: ${img.offsetWidth}x${img.offsetHeight}`);\n  };\n</script>\n\n<img id=\"img\" src=\"https://en.js.cx/clipart/train.gif?speed=1&cache=0\">\n```\n\n## window.onunload\n\nWhen a visitor leaves the page, the `unload` event triggers on `window`. We can do something there that doesn't involve a delay, like closing related popup windows.\n\nThe notable exception is sending analytics.\n\nLet's say we gather data about how the page is used: mouse clicks, scrolls, viewed page areas, and so on.\n\nNaturally, `unload` event is when the user leaves us, and we'd like to save the data on our server.\n\nThere exists a special `navigator.sendBeacon(url, data)` method for such needs, described in the specification <https://w3c.github.io/beacon/>.\n\nIt sends the data in background. The transition to another page is not delayed: the browser leaves the page, but still performs `sendBeacon`.\n\nHere's how to use it:\n```js\nlet analyticsData = { /* object with gathered data */ };\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"unload\", function() {\n  navigator.sendBeacon(\"/analytics\", JSON.stringify(analyticsData));\n};\n```\n\n- The request is sent as POST.\n- We can send not only a string, but also forms and other formats, as described in the chapter <info:fetch>, but usually it's a stringified object.\n- The data is limited by 64kb.\n\nWhen the `sendBeacon` request is finished, the browser probably has already left the document, so there's no way to get server response (which is usually empty for analytics).\n\nThere's also a `keepalive` flag for doing such \"after-page-left\" requests in  [fetch](info:fetch) method for generic network requests. You can find more information in the chapter <info:fetch-api>.\n\n\nIf we want to cancel the transition to another page, we can't do it here. But we can use another event -- `onbeforeunload`.\n\n## window.onbeforeunload [#window.onbeforeunload]\n\nIf a visitor initiated navigation away from the page or tries to close the window, the `beforeunload` handler asks for additional confirmation.\n\nIf we cancel the event, the browser may ask the visitor if they are sure.\n\nYou can try it by running this code and then reloading the page:\n\n```js run\nwindow.onbeforeunload = function() {\n  return false;\n};\n```\n\nFor historical reasons, returning a non-empty string also counts as canceling the event. Some time ago browsers used to show it as a message, but as the [modern specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#unloading-documents) says, they shouldn't.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```js run\nwindow.onbeforeunload = function() {\n  return \"There are unsaved changes. Leave now?\";\n};\n```\n\nThe behavior was changed, because some webmasters abused this event handler by showing misleading and annoying messages. So right now old browsers still may show it as a message, but aside of that -- there's no way to customize the message shown to the user.\n\n## readyState\n\nWhat happens if we set the `DOMContentLoaded` handler after the document is loaded?\n\nNaturally, it never runs.\n\nThere are cases when we are not sure whether the document is ready or not. We'd like our function to execute when the DOM is loaded, be it now or later.\n\nThe `document.readyState` property tells us about the current loading state.\n\nThere are 3 possible values:\n\n- `\"loading\"` -- the document is loading.\n- `\"interactive\"` -- the document was fully read.\n- `\"complete\"` -- the document was fully read and all resources (like images) are loaded too.\n\nSo we can check `document.readyState` and setup a handler or execute the code immediately if it's ready.\n\nLike this:\n\n```js\nfunction work() { /*...*/ }\n\nif (document.readyState == 'loading') {\n  // loading yet, wait for the event\n  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', work);\n} else {\n  // DOM is ready!\n  work();\n}\n```\n\nThere's also the `readystatechange` event that triggers when the state changes, so we can print all these states like this:\n\n```js run\n// current state\nconsole.log(document.readyState);\n\n// print state changes\ndocument.addEventListener('readystatechange', () => console.log(document.readyState));\n```\n\nThe `readystatechange` event is an alternative mechanics of tracking the document loading state, it appeared long ago. Nowadays, it is rarely used.\n\nLet's see the full events flow for the completeness.\n\nHere's a document with `<iframe>`, `<img>` and handlers that log events:\n\n```html\n<script>\n  log('initial readyState:' + document.readyState);\n\n  document.addEventListener('readystatechange', () => log('readyState:' + document.readyState));\n  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => log('DOMContentLoaded'));\n\n  window.onload = () => log('window onload');\n</script>\n\n<iframe src=\"iframe.html\" onload=\"log('iframe onload')\"></iframe>\n\n<img src=\"http://en.js.cx/clipart/train.gif\" id=\"img\">\n<script>\n  img.onload = () => log('img onload');\n</script>\n```\n\nThe working example is [in the sandbox](sandbox:readystate).\n\nThe typical output:\n1. [1] initial readyState:loading\n2. [2] readyState:interactive\n3. [2] DOMContentLoaded\n4. [3] iframe onload\n5. [4] img onload\n6. [4] readyState:complete\n7. [4] window onload\n\nThe numbers in square brackets denote the approximate time of when it happens. Events labeled with the same digit happen approximately at the same time (+- a few ms).\n\n- `document.readyState` becomes `interactive` right before `DOMContentLoaded`. These two things actually mean the same.\n- `document.readyState` becomes `complete` when all resources (`iframe` and `img`) are loaded. Here we can see that it happens in about the same time as `img.onload` (`img` is the last resource) and `window.onload`. Switching to `complete` state means the same as `window.onload`. The difference is that `window.onload` always works after all other `load` handlers.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nPage load events:\n\n- The `DOMContentLoaded` event triggers on `document` when the DOM is ready. We can apply JavaScript to elements at this stage.\n  - Script such as `<script>...</script>` or `<script src=\"...\"></script>` block DOMContentLoaded, the browser waits for them to execute.\n  - Images and other resources may also still continue loading.\n- The `load` event on `window` triggers when the page and all resources are loaded. We rarely use it, because there's usually no need to wait for so long.\n- The `beforeunload` event on `window` triggers when the user wants to leave the page. If we cancel the event, browser asks whether the user really wants to leave (e.g we have unsaved changes).\n- The `unload` event on `window` triggers when the user is finally leaving, in the handler we can only do simple things that do not involve delays or asking a user. Because of that limitation, it's rarely used. We can send out a network request with `navigator.sendBeacon`.\n- `document.readyState` is the current state of the document, changes can be tracked in the `readystatechange` event:\n  - `loading` -- the document is loading.\n  - `interactive` -- the document is parsed, happens at about the same time as `DOMContentLoaded`, but before it.\n  - `complete` -- the document and resources are loaded, happens at about the same time as `window.onload`, but before it.",

        "content": "\n\nIn modern websites, scripts are often \"heavier\" than HTML: their download size is larger, and processing time is also longer.\n\nWhen the browser loads HTML and comes across a `<script>...</script>` tag, it can't continue building the DOM. It must execute the script right now. The same happens for external scripts `<script src=\"...\"></script>`: the browser must wait until the script downloads, execute it, and only after process the rest of the page.\n\nThat leads to two important issues:\n\n1. Scripts can't see DOM elements below them, so they can't add handlers etc.\n2. If there's a bulky script at the top of the page, it \"blocks the page\". Users can't see the page content till it downloads and runs:\n\n```html run height=100\n<p>...content before script...</p>\n\n<script src=\"https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1\"></script>\n\n<!-- This isn't visible until the script loads -->\n<p>...content after script...</p>\n```\n\nThere are some workarounds to that. For instance, we can put a script at the bottom of the page. Then it can see elements above it, and it doesn't block the page content from showing:\n\n```html\n<body>\n  ...all content is above the script...\n\n  <script src=\"https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1\"></script>\n</body>\n```\n\nBut this solution is far from perfect. For example, the browser notices the script (and can start downloading it) only after it downloaded the full HTML document. For long HTML documents, that may be a noticeable delay.\n\nSuch things are invisible for people using very fast connections, but many people in the world still have slow internet speeds and use a far-from-perfect mobile internet connection.\n\nLuckily, there are two `<script>` attributes that solve the problem for us: `defer` and `async`.\n\n## defer\n\nThe `defer` attribute tells the browser that it should go on working with the page, and load the script \"in background\", then run the script when it loads.\n\nHere's the same example as above, but with `defer`:\n\n```html run height=100\n<p>...content before script...</p>\n\n<script defer src=\"https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1\"></script>\n\n<!-- visible immediately -->\n<p>...content after script...</p>\n```\n\n- Scripts with `defer` never block the page.\n- Scripts with `defer` always execute when the DOM is ready, but before `DOMContentLoaded` event.\n\nThe following example demonstrates that:\n\n```html run height=100\n<p>...content before scripts...</p>\n\n<script>\n  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => alert(\"DOM ready after defer!\")); // (2)\n</script>\n\n<script defer src=\"https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1\"></script>\n\n<p>...content after scripts...</p>\n```\n\n1. The page content shows up immediately.\n2. `DOMContentLoaded` waits for the deferred script. It only triggers when the script `(2)` is downloaded and executed.\n\nDeferred scripts keep their relative order, just like regular scripts.\n\nSo, if we have a long script first, and then a smaller one, then the latter one waits.\n\n```html\n<script defer src=\"https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js\"></script>\n<script defer src=\"https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/small.js\"></script>\n```\n\n```smart header=\"The small script downloads first, runs second\"\nBrowsers scan the page for scripts and download them in parallel, to improve performance. So in the example above both scripts download in parallel. The `small.js` probably makes it first.\n\nBut the specification requires scripts to execute in the document order, so it waits for `long.js` to execute.\n```\n\n```smart header=\"The `defer` attribute is only for external scripts\"\nThe `defer` attribute is ignored if the `<script>` tag has no `src`.\n```\n\n\n## async\n\nThe `async` attribute means that a script is completely independent:\n\n- The page doesn't wait for async scripts, the contents are processed and displayed.\n- `DOMContentLoaded` and async scripts don't wait for each other:\n    - `DOMContentLoaded` may happen both before an async script (if an async script finishes loading after the page is complete)\n    - ...or after an async script (if an async script is short or was in HTTP-cache)\n- Other scripts don't wait for `async` scripts, and `async` scripts don't wait for them.\n\n\nSo, if we have several `async` scripts, they may execute in any order. Whatever loads first -- runs first:\n\n```html run height=100\n<p>...content before scripts...</p>\n\n<script>\n  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => alert(\"DOM ready!\"));\n</script>\n\n<script async src=\"https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js\"></script>\n<script async src=\"https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/small.js\"></script>\n\n<p>...content after scripts...</p>\n```\n\n1. The page content shows up immediately: `async` doesn't block it.\n2. `DOMContentLoaded` may happen both before and after `async`, no guarantees here.\n3. Async scripts don't wait for each other. A smaller script `small.js` goes second, but probably loads before `long.js`, so runs first. That's called a \"load-first\" order.\n\nAsync scripts are great when we integrate an independent third-party script into the page: counters, ads and so on, as they don't depend on our scripts, and our scripts shouldn't wait for them:\n\n```html\n<!-- Google Analytics is usually added like this -->\n<script async src=\"https://google-analytics.com/analytics.js\"></script>\n```\n\n\n## Dynamic scripts\n\nWe can also add a script dynamically using JavaScript:\n\n```js run\nlet script = document.createElement('script');\nscript.src = \"/article/script-async-defer/long.js\";\ndocument.body.append(script); // (*)\n```\n\nThe script starts loading as soon as it's appended to the document `(*)`.\n\n**Dynamic scripts behave as \"async\" by default.**\n\nThat is:\n- They don't wait for anything, nothing waits for them.\n- The script that loads first -- runs first (\"load-first\" order).\n\n\n```js run\nlet script = document.createElement('script');\nscript.src = \"/article/script-async-defer/long.js\";\n\n*!*\nscript.async = false;\n*/!*\n\ndocument.body.append(script);\n```\n\nFor example, here we add two scripts. Without `script.async=false` they would execute in load-first order (the `small.js` probably first). But with that flag the order is \"as in the document\":\n\n\n```js run\nfunction loadScript(src) {\n  let script = document.createElement('script');\n  script.src = src;\n  script.async = false;\n  document.body.append(script);\n}\n\n// long.js runs first because of async=false\nloadScript(\"/article/script-async-defer/long.js\");\nloadScript(\"/article/script-async-defer/small.js\");\n```\n\n\n## Summary\n\nBoth `async` and `defer` have one common thing: downloading of such scripts doesn't block page rendering. So the user can read page content and get acquainted with the page immediately.\n\nBut there are also essential differences between them:\n\n|         | Order | `DOMContentLoaded` |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| `async` | *Load-first order*. Their document order doesn't matter -- which loads first |  Irrelevant. May load and execute while the document has not yet been fully downloaded. That happens if scripts are small or cached, and the document is long enough. |\n| `defer` | *Document order* (as they go in the document). |  Execute after the document is loaded and parsed (they wait if needed), right before `DOMContentLoaded`. |\n\n```warn header=\"Page without scripts should be usable\"\nPlease note that if you're using `defer`, then the page is visible *before* the script loads.\n\nSo the user may read the page, but some graphical components are probably not ready yet.\n\nThere should be \"loading\" indications in the proper places, and disabled buttons should show as such, so the user can clearly see what's ready and what's not.\n```\n\nIn practice, `defer` is used for scripts that need the whole DOM and/or their relative execution order is important. And  `async` is used for independent scripts, like counters or ads. And their relative execution order does not matter.",

We need to wait until the script loads, and only then we can call it.\n\n```smart\nFor our own scripts we could use [JavaScript modules](info:modules) here, but they are not widely adopted by third-party libraries.\n```\n\n### script.onload\n\nThe main helper is the `load` event. It triggers after the script was loaded and executed.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run untrusted\nlet script = document.createElement('script');\n\n// can load any script, from any domain\nscript.src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.3.0/lodash.js\"\ndocument.head.append(script);\n\n*!*\nscript.onload = function() {\n  // the script creates a helper function \"_\"\n  alert(_); // the function is available\n};\n*/!*\n```\n\nSo in `onload` we can use script variables, run functions etc.\n\n...And what if the loading failed? For instance, there's no such script (error 404) or the server is down (unavailable).\n\n### script.onerror\n\nErrors that occur during the loading of the script can be tracked in an `error` event.\n\nFor instance, let's request a script that doesn't exist:\n\n```js run\nlet script = document.createElement('script');\nscript.src = \"https://example.com/404.js\"; // no such script\ndocument.head.append(script);\n\n*!*\nscript.onerror = function() {\n  alert(\"Error loading \" + this.src); // Error loading https://example.com/404.js\n};\n*/!*\n```\n\nPlease note that we can't get HTTP error details here. We don't know if it was an error 404 or 500 or something else. Just that the loading failed.\n\n```warn\nEvents `onload`/`onerror` track only the loading itself.\n\nErrors that may occur during script processing and execution are out of scope for these events. That is: if a script loaded successfully, then `onload` triggers, even if it has programming errors in it. To track script errors, one can use `window.onerror` global handler.\n```\n\n## Other resources\n\nThe `load` and `error` events also work for other resources, basically for any resource that has an external `src`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js run\nlet img = document.createElement('img');\nimg.src = \"https://js.cx/clipart/train.gif\"; // (*)\n\nimg.onload = function() {\n  alert(`Image loaded, size ${img.width}x${img.height}`);\n};\n\nimg.onerror = function() {\n  alert(\"Error occurred while loading image\");\n};\n```\n\nThere are some notes though:\n\n- Most resources start loading when they are added to the document. But `<img>` is an exception. It starts loading when it gets a src `(*)`.\n- For `<iframe>`, the `iframe.onload` event triggers when the iframe loading finished, both for successful load and in case of an error.\n\nThat's for historical reasons.\n\n## Crossorigin policy\n\nThere's a rule: scripts from one site can't access contents of the other site. So, e.g. a script at `https://facebook.com` can't read the user's mailbox at `https://gmail.com`.\n\nOr, to be more precise, one origin (domain/port/protocol triplet) can't access the content from another one. So even if we have a subdomain, or just another port, these are different origins with no access to each other.\n\nThis rule also affects resources from other domains.\n\nIf we're using a script from another domain, and there's an error in it, we can't get error details.\n\nFor example, let's take a script `error.js` that consists of a single (bad) function call:\n```js\n// 📁 error.js\nnoSuchFunction();\n```\n\nNow load it from the same site where it's located:\n\n```html run height=0\n<script>\nwindow.onerror = function(message, url, line, col, errorObj) {\n  alert(`${message}\\n${url}, ${line}:${col}`);\n};\n</script>\n<script src=\"/article/onload-onerror/crossorigin/error.js\"></script>\n```\n\nWe can see a good error report, like this:\n\n```\nUncaught ReferenceError: noSuchFunction is not defined\nhttps://javascript.info/article/onload-onerror/crossorigin/error.js, 1:1\n```\n\nNow let's load the same script from another domain:\n\n```html run height=0\n<script>\nwindow.onerror = function(message, url, line, col, errorObj) {\n  alert(`${message}\\n${url}, ${line}:${col}`);\n};\n</script>\n<script src=\"https://cors.javascript.info/article/onload-onerror/crossorigin/error.js\"></script>\n```\n\nThe report is different, like this:\n\n```\nScript error.\n, 0:0\n```\n\nDetails may vary depending on the browser, but the idea is the same: any information about the internals of a script, including error stack traces, is hidden. Exactly because it's from another domain.\n\nWhy do we need error details?\n\nThere are many services (and we can build our own) that listen for global errors using `window.onerror`, save errors and provide an interface to access and analyze them. That's great, as we can see real errors, triggered by our users. But if a script comes from another origin, then there's not much information about errors in it, as we've just seen.\n\nSimilar cross-origin policy (CORS) is enforced for other types of resources as well.\n\n**To allow cross-origin access, the `<script>` tag needs to have the `crossorigin` attribute, plus the remote server must provide special headers.**\n\nThere are three levels of cross-origin access:\n\n1. **No `crossorigin` attribute** -- access prohibited.\n2. **`crossorigin=\"anonymous\"`** -- access allowed if the server responds with the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` with `*` or our origin. Browser does not send authorization information and cookies to remote server.\n3. **`crossorigin=\"use-credentials\"`** -- access allowed if the server sends back the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` with our origin and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`. Browser sends authorization information and cookies to remote server.\n\n```smart\nYou can read more about cross-origin access in the chapter <info:fetch-crossorigin>. It describes the `fetch` method for network requests, but the policy is exactly the same.\n\nSuch thing as \"cookies\" is out of our current scope, but you can read about them in the chapter <info:cookie>.\n```\n\nIn our case, we didn't have any crossorigin attribute. So the cross-origin access was prohibited. Let's add it.\n\nWe can choose between `\"anonymous\"` (no cookies sent, one server-side header needed) and `\"use-credentials\"` (sends cookies too, two server-side headers needed).\n\nIf we don't care about cookies, then `\"anonymous\"` is the way to go:\n\n```html run height=0\n<script>\nwindow.onerror = function(message, url, line, col, errorObj) {\n  alert(`${message}\\n${url}, ${line}:${col}`);\n};\n</script>\n<script *!*crossorigin=\"anonymous\"*/!* src=\"https://cors.javascript.info/article/onload-onerror/crossorigin/error.js\"></script>\n```\n\nNow, assuming that the server provides an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, everything's fine. We have the full error report.\n\n## Summary\n\nImages `<img>`, external styles, scripts and other resources provide `load` and `error` events to track their loading:\n\n- `load` triggers on a successful load,\n- `error` triggers on a failed load.\n\nThe only exception is `<iframe>`: for historical reasons it always triggers `load`, for any load completion, even if the page is not found.\n\nThe `readystatechange` event also works for resources, but is rarely used, because `load/error` events are simpler.",

That attribute allows us to focus on it and edit.\n\n```html run\n<div contentEditable id=\"elem\">Click and <b>edit</b>, please</div>\n\n<script>\nlet observer = new MutationObserver(mutationRecords => {\n  console.log(mutationRecords); // console.log(the changes)\n});\n\n// observe everything except attributes\nobserver.observe(elem, {\n  childList: true, // observe direct children\n  subtree: true, // and lower descendants too\n  characterDataOldValue: true // pass old data to callback\n});\n</script>\n```\n\nIf we run this code in the browser, then focus on the given `<div>` and change the text inside `<b>edit</b>`, `console.log` will show one mutation:\n\n```js\nmutationRecords = [{\n  type: \"characterData\",\n  oldValue: \"edit\",\n  target: <text node>,\n  // other properties empty\n}];\n```\n\nIf we make more complex editing operations, e.g. remove the `<b>edit</b>`, the mutation event may contain multiple mutation records:\n\n```js\nmutationRecords = [{\n  type: \"childList\",\n  target: <div#elem>,\n  removedNodes: [<b>],\n  nextSibling: <text node>,\n  previousSibling: <text node>\n  // other properties empty\n}, {\n  type: \"characterData\"\n  target: <text node>\n  // ...mutation details depend on how the browser handles such removal\n  // it may coalesce two adjacent text nodes \"edit \" and \", please\" into one node\n  // or it may leave them separate text nodes\n}];\n```\n\nSo, `MutationObserver` allows to react on any changes within DOM subtree.\n\n## Usage for integration\n\nWhen such thing may be useful?\n\nImagine the situation when you need to add a third-party script that contains useful functionality, but also does something unwanted, e.g. shows ads `<div class=\"ads\">Unwanted ads</div>`.\n\nNaturally, the third-party script provides no mechanisms to remove it.\n\nUsing `MutationObserver`, we can detect when the unwanted element appears in our DOM and remove it.\n\nThere are other situations when a third-party script adds something into our document, and we'd like to detect, when it happens, to adapt our page, dynamically resize something etc.\n\n`MutationObserver` allows to implement this.\n\n## Usage for architecture\n\nThere are also situations when `MutationObserver` is good from architectural standpoint.\n\nLet's say we're making a website about programming. Naturally, articles and other materials may contain source code snippets.\n\nSuch snippet in an HTML markup looks like this:\n\n```html\n...\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>\n  // here's the code\n  let hello = \"world\";\n</code></pre>\n...\n```\n\nAlso we'll use a JavaScript highlighting library on our site, e.g. [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/). A call to `Prism.highlightElem(pre)` examines the contents of such `pre` elements and adds into them special tags and styles for colored syntax highlighting, similar to what you see in examples here, at this page.\n\nWhen exactly to run that highlighting method? We can do it on `DOMContentLoaded` event, or at the bottom of the page. At that moment we have our DOM ready, can search for elements `pre[class*=\"language\"]` and call `Prism.highlightElem` on them:\n\n```js\n// highlight all code snippets on the page\ndocument.querySelectorAll('pre[class*=\"language\"]').forEach(Prism.highlightElem);\n```\n\nEverything's simple so far, right? There are `<pre>` code snippets in HTML, we highlight them.\n\nNow let's go on. Let's say we're going to dynamically fetch materials from a server. We'll study methods for that [later in the tutorial](info:fetch). For now it only matters that we fetch an HTML article from a webserver and display it on demand:\n\n```js\nlet article = /* fetch new content from server */\narticleElem.innerHTML = article;\n```\n\nThe new `article` HTML may contain code snippets. We need to call `Prism.highlightElem` on them, otherwise they won't get highlighted.\n\n**Where and when to call `Prism.highlightElem` for a dynamically loaded article?**\n\nWe could append that call to the code that loads an article, like this:\n\n```js\nlet article = /* fetch new content from server */\narticleElem.innerHTML = article;\n\n*!*\nlet snippets = articleElem.querySelectorAll('pre[class*=\"language-\"]');\nsnippets.forEach(Prism.highlightElem);\n*/!*\n```\n\n...But imagine, we have many places in the code where we load contents: articles, quizzes, forum posts. Do we need to put the highlighting call everywhere? That's not very convenient, and also easy to forget.\n\nAnd what if the content is loaded by a third-party module? E.g. we have a forum written by someone else, that loads contents dynamically, and we'd like to add syntax highlighting to it. No one likes to patch third-party scripts.\n\nLuckily, there's another option.\n\nWe can use `MutationObserver` to automatically detect when code snippets are inserted in the page and highlight them.\n\nSo we'll handle the highlighting functionality in one place, relieving us from the need to integrate it.\n\n### Dynamic highlight demo\n\nHere's the working example.\n\nIf you run this code, it starts observing the element below and highlighting any code snippets that appear there:\n\n```js run\nlet observer = new MutationObserver(mutations => {\n\n  for(let mutation of mutations) {\n    // examine new nodes, is there anything to highlight?\n\n    for(let node of mutation.addedNodes) {\n      // we track only elements, skip other nodes (e.g. text nodes)\n      if (!(node instanceof HTMLElement)) continue;\n\n      // check the inserted element for being a code snippet\n      if (node.matches('pre[class*=\"language-\"]')) {\n        Prism.highlightElement(node);\n      }\n\n      // or maybe there's a code snippet somewhere in its subtree?\n      for(let elem of node.querySelectorAll('pre[class*=\"language-\"]')) {\n        Prism.highlightElement(elem);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n});\n\nlet demoElem = document.getElementById('highlight-demo');\n\nobserver.observe(demoElem, {childList: true, subtree: true});\n```\n\nHere, below, there's an HTML-element and JavaScript that dynamically fills it using `innerHTML`.\n\nPlease run the previous code (above, observes that element), and then the code below. You'll see how `MutationObserver` detects and highlights the snippet.\n\n<p id=\"highlight-demo\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd\">A demo-element with <code>id=\"highlight-demo\"</code>, run the code above to observe it.</p>\n\nThe following code populates its `innerHTML`, that causes the `MutationObserver` to react and highlight its contents:\n\n```js run\nlet demoElem = document.getElementById('highlight-demo');\n\n// dynamically insert content with code snippets\ndemoElem.innerHTML = `A code snippet is below:\n  <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code> let hello = \"world!\"; </code></pre>\n  <div>Another one:</div>\n  <div>\n    <pre class=\"language-css\"><code>.class { margin: 5px; } </code></pre>\n  </div>\n`;\n```\n\nNow we have `MutationObserver` that can track all highlighting in observed elements or the whole `document`. We can add/remove code snippets in HTML without thinking about it.\n\n## Additional methods\n\nThere's a method to stop observing the node:\n\n- `observer.disconnect()` -- stops the observation.\n\nWhen we stop the observing, it might be possible that some changes were not processed by the observer yet.\n\n- `observer.takeRecords()` -- gets a list of unprocessed mutation records, those that happened, but the callback did not handle them.\n\nThese methods can be used together, like this:\n\n```js\n// we'd like to stop tracking changes\nobserver.disconnect();\n\n// handle unprocessed some mutations\nlet mutationRecords = observer.takeRecords();\n...\n```\n\n```smart header=\"Garbage collection interaction\"\nObservers use weak references to nodes internally. That is: if a node is removed from DOM, and becomes unreachable, then it becomes garbage collected.\n\nThe mere fact that a DOM node is observed doesn't prevent the garbage collection.\n```\n\n## Summary  \n\n`MutationObserver` can react on changes in DOM: attributes, added/removed elements, text content.\n\nWe can use it to track changes introduced by other parts of our code, as well as to integrate with third-party scripts.\n\n`MutationObserver` can track any changes. The config \"what to observe\" options are used for optimizations, not to spend resources on unneeded callback invocations.",

        "content": "\n\nIn this chapter we'll cover selection in the document, as well as selection in form fields, such as `<input>`.\n\nJavaScript can get the existing selection, select/deselect both as a whole or partially, remove the selected part from the document, wrap it into a tag, and so on.\n\nYou can get ready to use recipes at the end, in \"Summary\" section. But you'll get much more if you read the whole chapter. The underlying `Range` and `Selection` objects are easy to grasp, and then you'll need no recipes to make them do what you want.\n\n## Range\n\nThe basic concept of selection is [Range](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#ranges): basically, a pair of \"boundary points\": range start and range end.\n\nEach point represented as a parent DOM node with the relative offset from its start. If the parent node is an element node, then the offset is a child number, for a text node it's the position in the text. Examples to follow.\n\nLet's select something.\n\nFirst, we can create a range (the constructor has no parameters):\n\n```js\nlet range = new Range();\n```\n\nThen we can set the selection boundaries using `range.setStart(node, offset)` and `range.setEnd(node, offset)`.\n\nFor example, consider this fragment of HTML:\n\n```html\n<p id=\"p\">Example: <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b></p>\n```\n\nHere's its DOM structure, note that here text nodes are important for us:\n\n<div class=\"select-p-domtree\"></div>\n\n<script>\nlet selectPDomtree = {\n  \"name\": \"P\",\n  \"nodeType\": 1,\n  \"children\": [{\n    \"name\": \"#text\",\n    \"nodeType\": 3,\n    \"content\": \"Example: \"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"I\",\n    \"nodeType\": 1,\n    \"children\": [{\n      \"name\": \"#text\",\n      \"nodeType\": 3,\n      \"content\": \"italic\"\n    }]\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"#text\",\n    \"nodeType\": 3,\n    \"content\": \" and \"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"B\",\n    \"nodeType\": 1,\n    \"children\": [{\n      \"name\": \"#text\",\n      \"nodeType\": 3,\n      \"content\": \"bold\"\n    }]\n  }]\n}\n\ndrawHtmlTree(selectPDomtree, 'div.select-p-domtree', 690, 320);\n</script>\n\nLet's select `\"Example: <i>italic</i>\"`. That's two first children of `<p>` (counting text nodes):\n\n![](range-example-p-0-1.svg)\n\n```html run\n<p id=\"p\">Example: <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b></p>\n\n<script>\n*!*\n  let range = new Range();\n\n  range.setStart(p, 0);\n  range.setEnd(p, 2);\n*/!*\n\n  // toString of a range returns its content as text (without tags)\n  alert(range); // Example: italic\n\n  // apply this range for document selection (explained later)\n  document.getSelection().addRange(range);\n</script>\n```\n\n- `range.setStart(p, 0)` -- sets the start at the 0th child of `<p>` (that's the text node `\"Example: \"`).\n- `range.setEnd(p, 2)` -- spans the range up to (but not including) 2nd child of `<p>` (that's the text node `\" and \"`, but as the end is not included, so the last selected node is `<i>`).\n\nHere's a more flexible test stand where you try more variants:\n\n```html run autorun\n<p id=\"p\">Example: <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b></p>\n\nFrom <input id=\"start\" type=\"number\" value=1> – To <input id=\"end\" type=\"number\" value=4>\n<button id=\"button\">Click to select</button>\n<script>\n  button.onclick = () => {\n  *!*\n    let range = new Range();\n\n    range.setStart(p, start.value);\n    range.setEnd(p, end.value);\n  */!*\n\n    // apply the selection, explained later\n    document.getSelection().removeAllRanges();\n    document.getSelection().addRange(range);\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\nE.g. selecting from `1` to `4` gives range `<i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b>`.\n\n![](range-example-p-1-3.svg)\n\nWe don't have to use the same node in `setStart` and `setEnd`. A range may span across many unrelated nodes. It's only important that the end is after the start.\n\n### Selecting parts of text nodes\n\nLet's select the text partially, like this:\n\n![](range-example-p-2-b-3.svg)\n\nThat's also possible, we just need to set the start and the end as a relative offset in text nodes.\n\nWe need to create a range, that:\n- starts from position 2 in `<p>` first child (taking all but two first letters of \"Ex<b>ample:</b> \")\n- ends at the position 3 in `<b>` first child (taking first three letters of \"<b>bol</b>d\", but no more):\n\n```html run\n<p id=\"p\">Example: <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b></p>\n\n<script>\n  let range = new Range();\n\n  range.setStart(p.firstChild, 2);\n  range.setEnd(p.querySelector('b').firstChild, 3);\n\n  alert(range); // ample: italic and bol\n\n  // use this range for selection (explained later)\n  window.getSelection().addRange(range);\n</script>\n```\n\nThe range object has following properties:\n\n![](range-example-p-2-b-3-range.svg)\n\n- `startContainer`, `startOffset` -- node and offset of the start,\n  - in the example above: first text node inside `<p>` and `2`.\n- `endContainer`, `endOffset` -- node and offset of the end,\n  - in the example above: first text node inside `<b>` and `3`.\n- `collapsed` -- boolean, `true` if the range starts and ends on the same point (so there's no content inside the range),\n  - in the example above: `false`\n- `commonAncestorContainer` -- the nearest common ancestor of all nodes within the range,\n  - in the example above: `<p>`\n\n## Range methods\n\nThere are many convenience methods to manipulate ranges.\n\nSet range start:\n\n- `setStart(node, offset)` set start at: position `offset` in `node`\n- `setStartBefore(node)` set start at: right before `node`\n- `setStartAfter(node)` set start at: right after `node`\n\nSet range end (similar methods):\n\n- `setEnd(node, offset)` set end at: position `offset` in `node`\n- `setEndBefore(node)` set end at: right before `node`\n- `setEndAfter(node)` set end at: right after `node`\n\n**As it was demonstrated, `node` can be both a text or element node: for text nodes `offset` skips that many of characters, while for element nodes that many child nodes.**\n\nOthers:\n- `selectNode(node)` set range to select the whole `node`\n- `selectNodeContents(node)` set range to select the whole `node` contents\n- `collapse(toStart)` if `toStart=true` set end=start, otherwise set start=end, thus collapsing the range\n- `cloneRange()` creates a new range with the same start/end\n\nTo manipulate the content within the range:\n\n- `deleteContents()` -- remove range content from the document\n- `extractContents()` -- remove range content from the document and return as [DocumentFragment](info:modifying-document#document-fragment)\n- `cloneContents()` -- clone range content and return as [DocumentFragment](info:modifying-document#document-fragment)\n- `insertNode(node)` -- insert `node` into the document at the beginning of the range\n- `surroundContents(node)` -- wrap `node` around range content. For this to work, the range must contain both opening and closing tags for all elements inside it: no partial ranges like `<i>abc`.\n\nWith these methods we can do basically anything with selected nodes.\n\nHere's the test stand to see them in action:\n\n```html run autorun height=260\nClick buttons to run methods on the selection, \"resetExample\" to reset it.\n\n<p id=\"p\">Example: <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b></p>\n\n<p id=\"result\"></p>\n<script>\n  let range = new Range();\n\n  // Each demonstrated method is represented here:\n  let methods = {\n    deleteContents() {\n      range.deleteContents()\n    },\n    extractContents() {\n      let content = range.extractContents();\n      result.innerHTML = \"\";\n      result.append(\"extracted: \", content);\n    },\n    cloneContents() {\n      let content = range.cloneContents();\n      result.innerHTML = \"\";\n      result.append(\"cloned: \", content);\n    },\n    insertNode() {\n      let newNode = document.createElement('u');\n      newNode.innerHTML = \"NEW NODE\";\n      range.insertNode(newNode);\n    },\n    surroundContents() {\n      let newNode = document.createElement('u');\n      try {\n        range.surroundContents(newNode);\n      } catch(e) { alert(e) }\n    },\n    resetExample() {\n      p.innerHTML = `Example: <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b>`;\n      result.innerHTML = \"\";\n\n      range.setStart(p.firstChild, 2);\n      range.setEnd(p.querySelector('b').firstChild, 3);\n\n      window.getSelection().removeAllRanges();  \n      window.getSelection().addRange(range);  \n    }\n  };\n\n  for(let method in methods) {\n    document.write(`<div><button onclick=\"methods.${method}()\">${method}</button></div>`);\n  }\n\n  methods.resetExample();\n</script>\n```\n\nThere also exist methods to compare ranges, but these are rarely used. When you need them, please refer to the [spec](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-range) or [MDN manual](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Range).\n\n\n## Selection\n\n`Range` is a generic object for managing selection ranges. We may create such objects, pass them around -- they do not visually select anything on their own.\n\nThe document selection is represented by `Selection` object, that can be obtained as `window.getSelection()` or `document.getSelection()`.\n\nA selection may include zero or more ranges. At least, the [Selection API specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/selection-api/) says so. In practice though, only Firefox allows to select multiple ranges in the document by using `key:Ctrl+click` (`key:Cmd+click` for Mac).\n\nHere's a screenshot of a selection with 3 ranges, made in Firefox:\n\n![](selection-firefox.svg)\n\nOther browsers support at maximum 1 range. As we'll see, some of `Selection` methods imply that there may be many ranges, but again, in all browsers except Firefox, there's at maximum 1.\n\n## Selection properties\n\nSimilar to a range, a selection has a start, called \"anchor\", and the end, called \"focus\".\n\nThe main selection properties are:\n\n- `anchorNode` -- the node where the selection starts,\n- `anchorOffset` -- the offset in `anchorNode` where the selection starts,\n- `focusNode` -- the node where the selection ends,\n- `focusOffset` -- the offset in `focusNode` where the selection ends,\n- `isCollapsed` -- `true` if selection selects nothing (empty range), or doesn't exist.\n- `rangeCount` -- count of ranges in the selection, maximum `1` in all browsers except Firefox.\n\n````smart header=\"Selection end may be in the document before start\"\nThere are many ways to select the content, depending on the user agent: mouse, hotkeys, taps on a mobile etc.\n\nSome of them, such as a mouse, allow the same selection can be created in two directions: \"left-to-right\" and \"right-to-left\".\n\nIf the start (anchor) of the selection goes in the document before the end (focus), this selection is said to have \"forward\" direction.\n\nE.g. if the user starts selecting with mouse and goes from \"Example\" to \"italic\":\n\n![](selection-direction-forward.svg)\n\nOtherwise, if they go from the end of \"italic\" to \"Example\", the selection is directed \"backward\", its focus will be before the anchor:\n\n![](selection-direction-backward.svg)\n\nThat's different from `Range` objects that are always directed forward: the range start can't be after its end.\n````\n\n## Selection events\n\nThere are events on to keep track of selection:\n\n- `elem.onselectstart` -- when a selection starts on `elem`, e.g. the user starts moving mouse with pressed button.\n    - Preventing the default action makes the selection not start.\n- `document.onselectionchange` -- whenever a selection changes.\n    - Please note: this handler can be set only on `document`.\n\n### Selection tracking demo\n\nHere's a small demo that shows selection boundaries dynamically as it changes:\n\n```html run height=80\n<p id=\"p\">Select me: <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b></p>\n\nFrom <input id=\"from\" disabled> – To <input id=\"to\" disabled>\n<script>\n  document.onselectionchange = function() {\n    let {anchorNode, anchorOffset, focusNode, focusOffset} = document.getSelection();\n\n    from.value = `${anchorNode && anchorNode.data}:${anchorOffset}`;\n    to.value = `${focusNode && focusNode.data}:${focusOffset}`;\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\n### Selection getting demo\n\nTo get the whole selection:\n- As text: just call `document.getSelection().toString()`.\n- As DOM nodes: get the underlying ranges and call their `cloneContents()` method (only first range if we don't support Firefox multiselection).\n\nAnd here's the demo of getting the selection both as text and as DOM nodes:\n\n```html run height=100\n<p id=\"p\">Select me: <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b></p>\n\nCloned: <span id=\"cloned\"></span>\n<br>\nAs text: <span id=\"astext\"></span>\n\n<script>\n  document.onselectionchange = function() {\n    let selection = document.getSelection();\n\n    cloned.innerHTML = astext.innerHTML = \"\";\n\n    // Clone DOM nodes from ranges (we support multiselect here)\n    for (let i = 0; i < selection.rangeCount; i++) {\n      cloned.append(selection.getRangeAt(i).cloneContents());\n    }\n\n    // Get as text\n    astext.innerHTML += selection;\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\n## Selection methods\n\nSelection methods to add/remove ranges:\n\n- `getRangeAt(i)` -- get i-th range, starting from `0`. In all browsers except firefox, only `0` is used.\n- `addRange(range)` -- add `range` to selection. All browsers except Firefox ignore the call, if the selection already has an associated range.\n- `removeRange(range)` -- remove `range` from the selection.\n- `removeAllRanges()` -- remove all ranges.\n- `empty()` -- alias to `removeAllRanges`.\n\nAlso, there are convenience methods to manipulate the selection range directly, without `Range`:\n\n- `collapse(node, offset)` -- replace selected range with a new one that starts and ends at the given `node`, at position `offset`.\n- `setPosition(node, offset)` -- alias to `collapse`.\n- `collapseToStart()` - collapse (replace with an empty range) to selection start,\n- `collapseToEnd()` - collapse to selection end,\n- `extend(node, offset)` - move focus of the selection to the given `node`, position `offset`,\n- `setBaseAndExtent(anchorNode, anchorOffset, focusNode, focusOffset)` - replace selection range with the given start `anchorNode/anchorOffset` and end `focusNode/focusOffset`. All content in-between them is selected.\n- `selectAllChildren(node)` -- select all children of the `node`.\n- `deleteFromDocument()` -- remove selected content from the document.\n- `containsNode(node, allowPartialContainment = false)` -- checks whether the selection contains `node` (partially if the second argument is `true`)\n\nSo, for many tasks we can call `Selection` methods, no need to access the underlying `Range` object.\n\nFor example, selecting the whole contents of the paragraph `<p>`:\n\n```html run\n<p id=\"p\">Select me: <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b></p>\n\n<script>\n  // select from 0th child of <p> to the last child\n  document.getSelection().setBaseAndExtent(p, 0, p, p.childNodes.length);\n</script>\n```\n\nThe same thing using ranges:\n\n```html run\n<p id=\"p\">Select me: <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b></p>\n\n<script>\n  let range = new Range();\n  range.selectNodeContents(p); // or selectNode(p) to select the <p> tag too\n\n  document.getSelection().removeAllRanges(); // clear existing selection if any\n  document.getSelection().addRange(range);\n</script>\n```\n\n```smart header=\"To select, remove the existing selection first\"\nIf the selection already exists, empty it first with `removeAllRanges()`. And then add ranges. Otherwise, all browsers except Firefox ignore new ranges.\n\nThe exception is some selection methods, that replace the existing selection, like `setBaseAndExtent`.\n```\n\n## Selection in form controls\n\nForm elements, such as `input` and `textarea` provide [special API for selection](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#textFieldSelection), without `Selection` or `Range` objects. As an input value is a pure text, not HTML, there's no need for such objects, everything's much simpler.\n\nProperties:\n- `input.selectionStart` -- position of selection start (writeable),\n- `input.selectionEnd` -- position of selection end (writeable),\n- `input.selectionDirection` -- selection direction, one of: \"forward\", \"backward\" or \"none\" (if e.g. selected with a double mouse click),\n\nEvents:\n- `input.onselect` -- triggers when something is selected.\n\nMethods:\n\n- `input.select()` -- selects everything in the text control (can be `textarea` instead of `input`),\n- `input.setSelectionRange(start, end, [direction])` -- change the selection to span from position `start` till `end`, in the given direction (optional).\n- `input.setRangeText(replacement, [start], [end], [selectionMode])` -- replace a range of text with the new text.\n\n    Optional arguments `start` and `end`, if provided, set the range start and end, otherwise user selection is used.\n\n    The last argument, `selectionMode`, determines how the selection will be set after the text has been replaced. The possible values are:\n\n    - `\"select\"` -- the newly inserted text will be selected.\n    - `\"start\"` -- the selection range collapses just before the inserted text (the cursor will be immediately before it).\n    - `\"end\"` -- the selection range collapses just after the inserted text (the cursor will be right after it).\n    - `\"preserve\"` -- attempts to preserve the selection. This is the default.\n\nNow let's see these methods in action.\n\n### Example: tracking selection\n\nFor example, this code uses `onselect` event to track selection:\n\n```html run autorun\n<textarea id=\"area\" style=\"width:80%;height:60px\">\nSelecting in this text updates values below.\n</textarea>\n<br>\nFrom <input id=\"from\" disabled> – To <input id=\"to\" disabled>\n\n<script>\n  area.onselect = function() {\n    from.value = area.selectionStart;\n    to.value = area.selectionEnd;\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\nPlease note:\n- `onselect` triggers when something is selected, but not when the selection is removed.\n- `document.onselectionchange` event should not trigger for selections inside a form control, according to the [spec](https://w3c.github.io/selection-api/#dfn-selectionchange), as it's not related to `document` selection and ranges. Some browsers generate it, but we shouldn't rely on it.\n\n\n### Example: moving cursor\n\nWe can change `selectionStart` and `selectionEnd`, that sets the selection.\n\nAn important edge case is when `selectionStart` and `selectionEnd` equal each other. Then it's exactly the cursor position. Or, to rephrase, when nothing is selected, the selection is collapsed at the cursor position.\n\nSo, by setting `selectionStart` and `selectionEnd` to the same value, we move the cursor.\n\nFor example:\n\n```html run autorun\n<textarea id=\"area\" style=\"width:80%;height:60px\">\nFocus on me, the cursor will be at position 10.\n</textarea>\n\n<script>\n  area.onfocus = () => {\n    // zero delay setTimeout to run after browser \"focus\" action finishes\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      // we can set any selection\n      // if start=end, the cursor it exactly at that place\n      area.selectionStart = area.selectionEnd = 10;\n    });\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\n### Example: modifying selection\n\nTo modify the content of the selection, we can use `input.setRangeText()` method. Of course, we can read `selectionStart/End` and, with the knowledge of the selection, change the corresponding substring of `value`, but `setRangeText` is more powerful and often more convenient.\n\nThat's a somewhat complex method. In its simplest one-argument form it replaces the user selected range and removes the selection.\n\nFor example, here the user selection will be wrapped by `*...*`:\n\n```html run autorun\n<input id=\"input\" style=\"width:200px\" value=\"Select here and click the button\">\n<button id=\"button\">Wrap selection in stars *...*</button>\n\n<script>\nbutton.onclick = () => {\n  if (input.selectionStart == input.selectionEnd) {\n    return; // nothing is selected\n  }\n\n  let selected = input.value.slice(input.selectionStart, input.selectionEnd);\n  input.setRangeText(`*${selected}*`);\n};\n</script>\n```\n\nWith more arguments, we can set range `start` and `end`.\n\nIn this example we find `\"THIS\"` in the input text, replace it and keep the replacement selected:\n\n```html run autorun\n<input id=\"input\" style=\"width:200px\" value=\"Replace THIS in text\">\n<button id=\"button\">Replace THIS</button>\n\n<script>\nbutton.onclick = () => {\n  let pos = input.value.indexOf(\"THIS\");\n  if (pos >= 0) {\n    input.setRangeText(\"*THIS*\", pos, pos + 4, \"select\");\n    input.focus(); // focus to make selection visible\n  }\n};\n</script>\n```\n\n### Example: insert at cursor\n\nIf nothing is selected, or we use equal `start` and `end` in `setRangeText`, then the new text is just inserted, nothing is removed.\n\nWe can also insert something \"at the cursor\" using `setRangeText`.\n\nHere's a button that inserts `\"HELLO\"` at the cursor position and puts the cursor immediately after it. If the selection is not empty, then it gets replaced (we can detect it by comparing `selectionStart!=selectionEnd` and do something else instead):\n\n```html run autorun\n<input id=\"input\" style=\"width:200px\" value=\"Text Text Text Text Text\">\n<button id=\"button\">Insert \"HELLO\" at cursor</button>\n\n<script>\n  button.onclick = () => {\n    input.setRangeText(\"HELLO\", input.selectionStart, input.selectionEnd, \"end\");\n    input.focus();\n  };    \n</script>\n```\n\n\n## Making unselectable\n\nTo make something unselectable, there are three ways:\n\n1. Use CSS property `user-select: none`.\n\n    ```html run\n    <style>\n    #elem {\n      user-select: none;\n    }\n    </style>\n    <div>Selectable <div id=\"elem\">Unselectable</div> Selectable</div>\n    ```\n\n    This doesn't allow the selection to start at `elem`. But the user may start the selection elsewhere and include `elem` into it.\n\n    Then `elem` will become a part of `document.getSelection()`, so the selection actually happens, but its content is usually ignored in copy-paste.\n\n\n2. Prevent default action in `onselectstart` or `mousedown` events.\n\n    ```html run\n    <div>Selectable <div id=\"elem\">Unselectable</div> Selectable</div>\n\n    <script>\n      elem.onselectstart = () => false;\n    </script>\n    ```\n\n    This prevents starting the selection on `elem`, but the visitor may start it at another element, then extend to `elem`.\n\n    That's convenient when there's another event handler on the same action that triggers the select (e.g. `mousedown`). So we disable the selection to avoid conflict, still allowing `elem` contents to be copied.\n\n3. We can also clear the selection post-factum after it happens with `document.getSelection().empty()`. That's rarely used, as this causes unwanted blinking as the selection appears-disappears.\n\n## References\n\n- [DOM spec: Range](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#ranges)\n- [Selection API](https://www.w3.org/TR/selection-api/#dom-globaleventhandlers-onselectstart)\n- [HTML spec: APIs for the text control selections](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#textFieldSelection)\n\n\n## Summary\n\nWe covered two different APIs for selections:\n\n1. For document: `Selection` and `Range` objects.\n2. For `input`, `textarea`: additional methods and properties.\n\nThe second API is very simple, as it works with text.\n\nThe most used recipes are probably:\n\n1. Getting the selection:\n    ```js run\n    let selection = document.getSelection();\n\n    let cloned = /* element to clone the selected nodes to */;\n\n    // then apply Range methods to selection.getRangeAt(0)\n    // or, like here, to all ranges to support multi-select\n    for (let i = 0; i < selection.rangeCount; i++) {\n      cloned.append(selection.getRangeAt(i).cloneContents());\n    }\n    ```\n2. Setting the selection:\n    ```js run\n    let selection = document.getSelection();\n\n    // directly:\n    selection.setBaseAndExtent(...from...to...);\n\n    // or we can create a range and:\n    selection.removeAllRanges();\n    selection.addRange(range);\n    ```\n\nAnd finally, about the cursor. The cursor position in editable elements, like `<textarea>` is always at the start or the end of the selection. We can use it  to get cursor position or to move the cursor by setting `elem.selectionStart` and `elem.selectionEnd`.",

        "content": "\n\nBrowser JavaScript execution flow, as well as in Node.js, is based on an *event loop*.\n\nUnderstanding how event loop works is important for optimizations, and sometimes for the right architecture.\n\nIn this chapter we first cover theoretical details about how things work, and then see practical applications of that knowledge.\n\n## Event Loop\n\nThe concept of *event loop* is very simple. There's an endless loop, when JavaScript engine waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps waiting for more tasks.\n\nThe general algorithm of the engine:\n\n1. While there are tasks:\n    - execute them, starting with the oldest task.\n2. Sleep until a task appears, then go to 1.\n\nThat's a formalization for what we see when browsing a page. JavaScript engine does nothing most of the time, only runs if a script/handler/event activates.\n\nExamples of tasks:\n\n- When an external script `<script src=\"...\">` loads, the task is to execute it.\n- When a user moves their mouse, the task is to dispatch `mousemove` event and execute handlers.\n- When the time is due for a scheduled `setTimeout`, the task is to run its callback.\n- ...and so on.\n\nTasks are set -- the engine handles them -- then waits for more tasks (while sleeping and consuming close to zero CPU).\n\nIt may happen that a task comes while the engine is busy, then it's enqueued.\n\nThe tasks form a queue, so-called \"macrotask queue\" (v8 term):\n\n![](eventLoop.svg)\n\nFor instance, while the engine is busy executing a `script`, a user may move their mouse causing `mousemove`, and `setTimeout` may be due and so on, these tasks form a queue, as illustrated on the picture above.\n\nTasks from the queue are processed on \"first come – first served\" basis. When the engine browser is done with the `script`, it handles `mousemove` event, then `setTimeout` handler, and so on.\n\nSo far, quite simple, right?\n\nTwo more details:\n1. Rendering never happens while the engine executes a task. Doesn't matter if the task takes a long time. Changes to DOM are painted only after the task is complete.\n2. If a task takes too long, the browser can't do other tasks, process user events, so after a time it raises an alert like \"Page Unresponsive\" suggesting to kill the task with the whole page. That happens when there are a lot of complex calculations or a programming error leading to infinite loop.\n\nThat was a theory. Now let's see how we can apply that knowledge.\n\n## Use-case 1: splitting CPU-hungry tasks\n\nLet's say we have a CPU-hungry task.\n\nFor example, syntax-highlighting (used to colorize code examples on this page) is quite CPU-heavy. To highlight the code, it performs the analysis, creates many colored elements, adds them to the document -- for a large amount of text that takes a lot of time.\n\nWhile the engine is busy with syntax highlighting, it can't do other DOM-related stuff, process user events, etc. It may even cause the browser to \"hiccup\" or even \"hang\" for a bit, which is unacceptable.\n\nWe can avoid problems by splitting the big task into pieces. Highlight first 100 lines, then schedule `setTimeout` (with zero-delay) for the next 100 lines, and so on.\n\nTo demonstrate this approach, for the sake of simplicity, instead of text-highlighting, let's take a function that counts from `1` to `1000000000`.\n\nIf you run the code below, the engine will \"hang\" for some time. For server-side JS that's clearly noticeable, and if you are running it in-browser, then try to click other buttons on the page -- you'll see that no other events get handled until the counting finishes.\n\n```js run\nlet i = 0;\n\nlet start = Date.now();\n\nfunction count() {\n\n  // do a heavy job\n  for (let j = 0; j < 1e9; j++) {\n    i++;\n  }\n\n  alert(\"Done in \" + (Date.now() - start) + 'ms');\n}\n\ncount();\n```\n\nThe browser may even show a \"the script takes too long\" warning.\n\nLet's split the job using nested `setTimeout` calls:\n\n```js run\nlet i = 0;\n\nlet start = Date.now();\n\nfunction count() {\n\n  // do a piece of the heavy job (*)\n  do {\n    i++;\n  } while (i % 1e6 != 0);\n\n  if (i == 1e9) {\n    alert(\"Done in \" + (Date.now() - start) + 'ms');\n  } else {\n    setTimeout(count); // schedule the new call (**)\n  }\n\n}\n\ncount();\n```\n\nNow the browser interface is fully functional during the \"counting\" process.\n\nA single run of `count` does a part of the job `(*)`, and then re-schedules itself `(**)` if needed:\n\n1. First run counts: `i=1...1000000`.\n2. Second run counts: `i=1000001..2000000`.\n3. ...and so on.\n\nNow, if a new side task (e.g. `onclick` event) appears while the engine is busy executing part 1, it gets queued and then executes when part 1 finished, before the next part. Periodic returns to the event loop between `count` executions provide just enough \"air\" for the JavaScript engine to do something else, to react to other user actions.\n\nThe notable thing is that both variants -- with and without splitting the job by `setTimeout` -- are comparable in speed. There's not much difference in the overall counting time.\n\nTo make them closer, let's make an improvement.\n\nWe'll move the scheduling to the beginning of the `count()`:\n\n```js run\nlet i = 0;\n\nlet start = Date.now();\n\nfunction count() {\n\n  // move the scheduling to the beginning\n  if (i < 1e9 - 1e6) {\n    setTimeout(count); // schedule the new call\n  }\n\n  do {\n    i++;\n  } while (i % 1e6 != 0);\n\n  if (i == 1e9) {\n    alert(\"Done in \" + (Date.now() - start) + 'ms');\n  }\n\n}\n\ncount();\n```\n\nNow when we start to `count()` and see that we'll need to `count()` more, we schedule that immediately, before doing the job.\n\nIf you run it, it's easy to notice that it takes significantly less time.\n\nWhy?  \n\nThat's simple: as you remember, there's the in-browser minimal delay of 4ms for many nested `setTimeout` calls. Even if we set `0`, it's `4ms` (or a bit more). So the earlier we schedule it - the faster it runs.\n\nFinally, we've split a CPU-hungry task into parts - now it doesn't block the user interface. And its overall execution time isn't much longer.\n\n## Use case 2: progress indication\n\nAnother benefit of splitting heavy tasks for browser scripts is that we can show progress indication.\n\nUsually the browser renders after the currently running code is complete. Doesn't matter if the task takes a long time. Changes to DOM are painted only after the task is finished.\n\nOn one hand, that's great, because our function may create many elements, add them one-by-one to the document and change their styles -- the visitor won't see any \"intermediate\", unfinished state. An important thing, right?\n\nHere's the demo, the changes to `i` won't show up until the function finishes, so we'll see only the last value:\n\n\n```html run\n<div id=\"progress\"></div>\n\n<script>\n\n  function count() {\n    for (let i = 0; i < 1e6; i++) {\n      i++;\n      progress.innerHTML = i;\n    }\n  }\n\n  count();\n</script>\n```\n\n...But we also may want to show something during the task, e.g. a progress bar.\n\nIf we split the heavy task into pieces using `setTimeout`, then changes are painted out in-between them.\n\nThis looks prettier:\n\n```html run\n<div id=\"progress\"></div>\n\n<script>\n  let i = 0;\n\n  function count() {\n\n    // do a piece of the heavy job (*)\n    do {\n      i++;\n      progress.innerHTML = i;\n    } while (i % 1e3 != 0);\n\n    if (i < 1e7) {\n      setTimeout(count);\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  count();\n</script>\n```\n\nNow the `<div>` shows increasing values of `i`, a kind of a progress bar.\n\n\n## Use case 3: doing something after the event\n\nIn an event handler we may decide to postpone some actions until the event bubbled up and was handled on all levels. We can do that by wrapping the code in zero delay `setTimeout`.\n\nIn the chapter <info:dispatch-events> we saw an example: custom event `menu-open` is dispatched in `setTimeout`, so that it happens after the \"click\" event is fully handled.\n\n```js\nmenu.onclick = function() {\n  // ...\n\n  // create a custom event with the clicked menu item data\n  let customEvent = new CustomEvent(\"menu-open\", {\n    bubbles: true\n  });\n\n  // dispatch the custom event asynchronously\n  setTimeout(() => menu.dispatchEvent(customEvent));\n};\n```\n\n## Macrotasks and Microtasks\n\nAlong with *macrotasks*, described in this chapter, there exist *microtasks*, mentioned in the chapter <info:microtask-queue>.\n\nMicrotasks come solely from our code. They are usually created by promises: an execution of `.then/catch/finally` handler becomes a microtask. Microtasks are used \"under the cover\" of `await` as well, as it's another form of promise handling.\n\nThere's also a special function `queueMicrotask(func)` that queues `func` for execution in the microtask queue.\n\n**Immediately after every *macrotask*, the engine executes all tasks from *microtask* queue, prior to running any other macrotasks or rendering or anything else.**\n\nFor instance, take a look:\n\n```js run\nsetTimeout(() => alert(\"timeout\"));\n\nPromise.resolve()\n  .then(() => alert(\"promise\"));\n\nalert(\"code\");\n```\n\nWhat's going to be the order here?\n\n1. `code` shows first, because it's a regular synchronous call.\n2. `promise` shows second, because `.then` passes through the microtask queue, and runs after the current code.\n3. `timeout` shows last, because it's a macrotask.\n\nThe richer event loop picture looks like this (order is from top to bottom, that is: the script first, then microtasks, rendering and so on):\n\n![](eventLoop-full.svg)\n\nAll microtasks are completed before any other event handling or rendering or any other macrotask takes place.\n\nThat's important, as it guarantees that the application environment is basically the same (no mouse coordinate changes, no new network data, etc) between microtasks.\n\nIf we'd like to execute a function asynchronously (after the current code), but before changes are rendered or new events handled, we can schedule it with `queueMicrotask`.\n\nHere's an example with \"counting progress bar\", similar to the one shown previously, but `queueMicrotask` is used instead of `setTimeout`. You can see that it renders at the very end. Just like the synchronous code:\n\n```html run\n<div id=\"progress\"></div>\n\n<script>\n  let i = 0;\n\n  function count() {\n\n    // do a piece of the heavy job (*)\n    do {\n      i++;\n      progress.innerHTML = i;\n    } while (i % 1e3 != 0);\n\n    if (i < 1e6) {\n  *!*\n      queueMicrotask(count);\n  */!*\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  count();\n</script>\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nThe more detailed algorithm of the event loop (though still simplified compare to the [specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-loop-processing-model)):\n\n1. Dequeue and run the oldest task from the *macrotask* queue (e.g. \"script\").\n2. Execute all *microtasks*:\n    - While the microtask queue is not empty:\n        - Dequeue and run the oldest microtask.\n3. Render changes if any.\n4. If the macrotask queue is empty, wait till a macrotask appears.\n5. Go to step 1.\n\nTo schedule a new *macrotask*:\n- Use zero delayed `setTimeout(f)`.\n\nThat may be used to split a big calculation-heavy task into pieces, for the browser to be able to react on user events and show progress between them.\n\nAlso, used in event handlers to schedule an action after the event is fully handled (bubbling done).\n\nTo schedule a new *microtask*\n- Use `queueMicrotask(f)`.\n- Also promise handlers go through the microtask queue.\n\nThere's no UI or network event handling between microtasks: they run immediately one after another.\n\nSo one may want to `queueMicrotask` to execute a function asynchronously, but within the environment state.\n\n```smart header=\"Web Workers\"\nFor long heavy calculations that shouldn't block the event loop, we can use [Web Workers](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html).\n\nThat's a way to run code in another, parallel thread.\n\nWeb Workers can exchange messages with the main process, but they have their own variables, and their own event loop.\n\nWeb Workers do not have access to DOM, so they are useful, mainly, for calculations, to use multiple CPU cores simultaneously.\n```",

        "content": "\n\nA popup window is one of the oldest methods to show additional document to user.\n\nBasically, you just run:\n```js\nwindow.open('https://javascript.info/')\n```\n\n...And it will open a new window with given URL. Most modern browsers are configured to open new tabs instead of separate windows.\n\nPopups exist from really ancient times. The initial idea was to show another content without closing the main window. As of now, there are other ways to do that: we can load content dynamically with [fetch](info:fetch) and show it in a dynamically generated `<div>`. So, popups is not something we use everyday.\n\nAlso, popups are tricky on mobile devices, that don't show multiple windows simultaneously.\n\nStill, there are tasks where popups are still used, e.g. for OAuth authorization (login with Google/Facebook/...), because:\n\n1. A popup is a separate window with its own independent JavaScript environment. So opening a popup with a third-party non-trusted site is safe.\n2. It's very easy to open a popup.\n3. A popup can navigate (change URL) and send messages to the opener window.\n\n## Popup blocking\n\nIn the past, evil sites abused popups a lot. A bad page could open tons of popup windows with ads. So now most browsers try to block popups and protect the user.\n\n**Most browsers block popups if they are called outside of user-triggered event handlers like `onclick`.**\n\nFor example:\n```js\n// popup blocked\nwindow.open('https://javascript.info');\n\n// popup allowed\nbutton.onclick = () => {\n  window.open('https://javascript.info');\n};\n```\n\nThis way users are somewhat protected from unwanted popups, but the functionality is not disabled totally.\n\nWhat if the popup opens from `onclick`, but after `setTimeout`? That's a bit tricky.\n\nTry this code:\n\n```js run\n// open after 3 seconds\nsetTimeout(() => window.open('http://google.com'), 3000);\n```\n\nThe popup opens in Chrome, but gets blocked in Firefox.\n\n...If we decrease the delay, the popup works in Firefox too:\n\n```js run\n// open after 1 seconds\nsetTimeout(() => window.open('http://google.com'), 1000);\n```\n\nThe difference is that Firefox treats a timeout of 2000ms or less are acceptable, but after it -- removes the \"trust\", assuming that now it's \"outside of the user action\". So the first one is blocked, and the second one is not.\n\n## window.open\n\nThe syntax to open a popup is: `window.open(url, name, params)`:\n\nurl\n: An URL to load into the new window.\n\nname\n: A name of the new window. Each window has a `window.name`, and here we can specify which window to use for the popup. If there's already a window with such name -- the given URL opens in it, otherwise a new window is opened.\n\nparams\n: The configuration string for the new window. It contains settings, delimited by a comma. There must be no spaces in params, for instance: `width:200,height=100`.\n\nSettings for `params`:\n\n- Position:\n  - `left/top` (numeric) -- coordinates of the window top-left corner on the screen. There is a limitation: a new window cannot be positioned offscreen.\n  - `width/height` (numeric) -- width and height of a new window. There is a limit on minimal width/height, so it's impossible to create an invisible window.\n- Window features:\n  - `menubar` (yes/no) -- shows or hides the browser menu on the new window.\n  - `toolbar` (yes/no) -- shows or hides the browser navigation bar (back, forward, reload etc) on the new window.\n  - `location` (yes/no) -- shows or hides the URL field in the new window. FF and IE don't allow to hide it by default.\n  - `status` (yes/no) -- shows or hides the status bar. Again, most browsers force it to show.\n  - `resizable` (yes/no) -- allows to disable the resize for the new window. Not recommended.\n  - `scrollbars` (yes/no) -- allows to disable the scrollbars for the new window. Not recommended.\n\n\nThere is also a number of less supported browser-specific features, which are usually not used. Check <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.open\">window.open in MDN</a> for examples.\n\n## Example: a minimalistic window   \n\nLet's open a window with minimal set of features just to see which of them browser allows to disable:\n\n```js run\nlet params = `scrollbars=no,resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,\nwidth=0,height=0,left=-1000,top=-1000`;\n\nopen('/', 'test', params);\n```\n\nHere most \"window features\" are disabled and window is positioned offscreen. Run it and see what really happens. Most browsers \"fix\" odd things like zero `width/height` and offscreen `left/top`. For instance, Chrome open such a window with full width/height, so that it occupies the full screen.\n\nLet's add normal positioning options and reasonable `width`, `height`, `left`, `top` coordinates:\n\n```js run\nlet params = `scrollbars=no,resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,\nwidth=600,height=300,left=100,top=100`;\n\nopen('/', 'test', params);\n```\n\nMost browsers show the example above as required.\n\nRules for omitted settings:\n\n- If there is no 3rd argument in the `open` call, or it is empty, then the default window parameters are used.\n- If there is a string of params, but some `yes/no` features are omitted, then the omitted features assumed to have `no` value. So if you specify params, make sure you explicitly set all required features to yes.\n- If there is no `left/top` in params, then the browser tries to open a new window near the last opened window.\n- If there is no `width/height`, then the new window will be the same size as the last opened.\n\n## Accessing popup from window\n\nThe `open` call returns a reference to the new window. It can be used to manipulate it's properties, change location and even more.\n\nIn this example, we generate popup content from JavaScript:\n\n```js\nlet newWin = window.open(\"about:blank\", \"hello\", \"width=200,height=200\");\n\nnewWin.document.write(\"Hello, world!\");\n```\n\nAnd here we modify the contents after loading:\n\n```js run\nlet newWindow = open('/', 'example', 'width=300,height=300')\nnewWindow.focus();\n\nalert(newWindow.location.href); // (*) about:blank, loading hasn't started yet\n\nnewWindow.onload = function() {\n  let html = `<div style=\"font-size:30px\">Welcome!</div>`;\n*!*\n  newWindow.document.body.insertAdjacentHTML('afterbegin', html);\n*/!*\n};\n```\n\nPlease note: immediately after `window.open`, the new window isn't loaded yet. That's demonstrated by `alert` in line `(*)`. So we wait for `onload` to modify it. We could also use `DOMContentLoaded` handler for `newWin.document`.\n\n```warn header=\"Same origin policy\"\nWindows may freely access content of each other only if they come from the same origin (the same protocol://domain:port).\n\nOtherwise, e.g. if the main window is from `site.com`, and the popup from `gmail.com`, that's impossible for user safety reasons. For the details, see chapter <info:cross-window-communication>.\n```\n\n## Accessing window from popup\n\nA popup may access the \"opener\" window as well using `window.opener` reference. It is `null` for all windows except popups.\n\nIf you run the code below, it replaces the opener (current) window content with \"Test\":\n\n```js run\nlet newWin = window.open(\"about:blank\", \"hello\", \"width=200,height=200\");\n\nnewWin.document.write(\n  \"<script>window.opener.document.body.innerHTML = 'Test'<\\/script>\"\n);\n```\n\nSo the connection between the windows is bidirectional: the main window and the popup have a reference to each other.\n\n## Closing a popup\n\nTo close a window: `win.close()`.\n\nTo check if a window is closed: `win.closed`.\n\nTechnically, the `close()` method is available for any `window`, but `window.close()` is ignored by most browsers if `window` is not created with `window.open()`. So it'll only work on a popup.\n\nThe `closed` property is `true` if the window is closed. That's useful to check if the popup (or the main window) is still open or not. A user can close it anytime, and our code should take that possibility into account.\n\nThis code loads and then closes the window:\n\n```js run\nlet newWindow = open('/', 'example', 'width=300,height=300');\n\nnewWindow.onload = function() {\n  newWindow.close();\n  alert(newWindow.closed); // true\n};\n```\n\n\n## Scrolling and resizing\n\nThere are methods to move/resize a window:\n\n`win.moveBy(x,y)`\n: Move the window relative to current position `x` pixels to the right and `y` pixels down. Negative values are allowed (to move left/up).\n\n`win.moveTo(x,y)`\n: Move the window to coordinates `(x,y)` on the screen.\n\n`win.resizeBy(width,height)`\n: Resize the window by given `width/height` relative to the current size. Negative values are allowed.\n\n`win.resizeTo(width,height)`\n: Resize the window to the given size.\n\nThere's also `window.onresize` event.\n\n```warn header=\"Only popups\"\nTo prevent abuse, the browser usually blocks these methods. They only work reliably on popups that we opened, that have no additional tabs.\n```\n\n```warn header=\"No minification/maximization\"\nJavaScript has no way to minify or maximize a window. These OS-level functions are hidden from Frontend-developers.\n\nMove/resize methods do not work for maximized/minimized windows.\n```\n\n## Scrolling a window\n\nWe already talked about scrolling a window in the chapter <info:size-and-scroll-window>.\n\n`win.scrollBy(x,y)`\n: Scroll the window `x` pixels right and `y` down relative the current scroll. Negative values are allowed.\n\n`win.scrollTo(x,y)`\n: Scroll the window to the given coordinates `(x,y)`.\n\n`elem.scrollIntoView(top = true)`\n: Scroll the window to make `elem` show up at the top (the default) or at the bottom for `elem.scrollIntoView(false)`.\n\nThere's also `window.onscroll` event.\n\n## Focus/blur on a window\n\nTheoretically, there are `window.focus()` and `window.blur()` methods to focus/unfocus on a window.  Also there are `focus/blur` events that allow to focus a window and catch the moment when the visitor switches elsewhere.\n\nIn the past evil pages abused those. For instance, look at this code:\n\n```js run\nwindow.onblur = () => window.focus();\n```\n\nWhen a user attempts to switch out of the window (`blur`), it brings it back to focus. The intention is to \"lock\" the user within the `window`.\n\nSo, there are limitations that forbid the code like that. There are many limitations to protect the user from ads and evils pages. They depend on the browser.\n\nFor instance, a mobile browser usually ignores that call completely. Also focusing doesn't work when a popup opens in a separate tab rather than a new window.\n\nStill, there are some things that can be done.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- When we open a popup, it's might be a good idea to run a `newWindow.focus()` on it. Just in case, for some OS/browser combinations it ensures that the user is in the new window now.\n- If we want to track when a visitor actually uses our web-app, we can track `window.onfocus/onblur`. That allows us to suspend/resume in-page activities, animations etc. But please note that the `blur` event means that the visitor switched out from the window, but they still may observe it. The window is in the background, but still may be visible.\n\n## Summary   \n\nPopup windows are used rarely, as there are alternatives: loading and displaying information in-page, or in iframe.\n\nIf we're going to open a popup, a good practice is to inform the user about it. An \"opening window\" icon near a link or button would allow the visitor to survive the focus shift and keep both windows in mind.\n\n- A popup can be opened by the `open(url, name, params)` call. It returns the reference to the newly opened window.\n- Browsers block `open` calls from the code outside of user actions. Usually a notification appears, so that a user may allow them.\n- Browsers open a new tab by default, but if sizes are provided, then it'll be a popup window.\n- The popup may access the opener window using the `window.opener` property.\n- The main window and the popup can freely read and modify each other if they have the same origin. Otherwise, they can change location of each other and [exchange messages](info:cross-window-communication).\n\nTo close the popup: use `close()` call. Also the user may close them (just like any other windows). The `window.closed` is `true` after that.\n\n- Methods `focus()` and `blur()` allow to focus/unfocus a window. But they don't work all the time.\n- Events `focus` and `blur` allow to track switching in and out of the window. But please note that a  window may still be visible even in the background state, after `blur`.",

        "content": "\n\nThe \"Same Origin\" (same site) policy limits access of windows and frames to each other.\n\nThe idea is that if a user has two pages open: one from `john-smith.com`, and another one is `gmail.com`, then they wouldn't want a script from `john-smith.com` to read our mail from `gmail.com`. So, the purpose of the \"Same Origin\" policy is to protect users from information theft.\n\n## Same Origin [#same-origin]\n\nTwo URLs are said to have the \"same origin\" if they have the same protocol, domain and port.\n\nThese URLs all share the same origin:\n\n- `http://site.com`\n- `http://site.com/`\n- `http://site.com/my/page.html`\n\nThese ones do not:\n\n- <code>http://<b>www.</b>site.com</code> (another domain: `www.` matters)\n- <code>http://<b>site.org</b></code> (another domain: `.org` matters)\n- <code><b>https://</b>site.com</code> (another protocol: `https`)\n- <code>http://site.com:<b>8080</b></code> (another port: `8080`)\n\nThe \"Same Origin\" policy states that:\n\n- if we have a reference to another window, e.g. a popup created by `window.open` or a window inside `<iframe>`, and that window comes from the same origin, then we have full access to that window.\n- otherwise, if it comes from another origin, then we can't access the content of that window: variables, document, anything. The only exception is `location`: we can change it (thus redirecting the user). But we cannot *read* location (so we can't see where the user is now, no information leak).\n\n### In action: iframe\n\nAn `<iframe>` tag hosts a separate embedded window, with its own separate `document` and `window` objects.\n\nWe can access them using properties:\n\n- `iframe.contentWindow` to get the window inside the `<iframe>`.\n- `iframe.contentDocument` to get the document inside the `<iframe>`, shorthand for `iframe.contentWindow.document`.\n\nWhen we access something inside the embedded window, the browser checks if the iframe has the same origin. If that's not so then the access is denied (writing to `location` is an exception, it's still permitted).\n\nFor instance, let's try reading and writing to `<iframe>` from another origin:\n\n```html run\n<iframe src=\"https://example.com\" id=\"iframe\"></iframe>\n\n<script>\n  iframe.onload = function() {\n    // we can get the reference to the inner window\n*!*\n    let iframeWindow = iframe.contentWindow; // OK\n*/!*\n    try {\n      // ...but not to the document inside it\n*!*\n      let doc = iframe.contentDocument; // ERROR\n*/!*\n    } catch(e) {\n      alert(e); // Security Error (another origin)\n    }\n\n    // also we can't READ the URL of the page in iframe\n    try {\n      // Can't read URL from the Location object\n*!*\n      let href = iframe.contentWindow.location.href; // ERROR\n*/!*\n    } catch(e) {\n      alert(e); // Security Error\n    }\n\n    // ...we can WRITE into location (and thus load something else into the iframe)!\n*!*\n    iframe.contentWindow.location = '/'; // OK\n*/!*\n\n    iframe.onload = null; // clear the handler, not to run it after the location change\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\nThe code above shows errors for any operations except:\n\n- Getting the reference to the inner window `iframe.contentWindow` - that's allowed.\n- Writing to `location`.\n\nContrary to that, if the `<iframe>` has the same origin, we can do anything with it:\n\n```html run\n<!-- iframe from the same site -->\n<iframe src=\"/\" id=\"iframe\"></iframe>\n\n<script>\n  iframe.onload = function() {\n    // just do anything\n    iframe.contentDocument.body.prepend(\"Hello, world!\");\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\n```smart header=\"`iframe.onload` vs `iframe.contentWindow.onload`\"\nThe `iframe.onload` event (on the `<iframe>` tag) is essentially the same as `iframe.contentWindow.onload` (on the embedded window object). It triggers when the embedded window fully loads with all resources.\n\n...But we can't access `iframe.contentWindow.onload` for an iframe from another origin, so using `iframe.onload`.\n```\n\n## Windows on subdomains: document.domain\n\nBy definition, two URLs with different domains have different origins.\n\nBut if windows share the same second-level domain, for instance `john.site.com`, `peter.site.com` and `site.com` (so that their common second-level domain is `site.com`), we can make the browser ignore that difference, so that they can be treated as coming from the \"same origin\" for the purposes of cross-window communication.\n\nTo make it work, each such window should run the code:\n\n```js\ndocument.domain = 'site.com';\n```\n\nThat's all. Now they can interact without limitations. Again, that's only possible for pages with the same second-level domain.\n\n## Iframe: wrong document pitfall\n\nWhen an iframe comes from the same origin, and we may access its  `document`, there's a pitfall. It's not related to cross-origin things, but important to know.\n\nUpon its creation an iframe immediately has a document. But that document is different from the one that loads into it!\n\nSo if we do something with the document immediately, that will probably be lost.\n\nHere, look:\n\n\n```html run\n<iframe src=\"/\" id=\"iframe\"></iframe>\n\n<script>\n  let oldDoc = iframe.contentDocument;\n  iframe.onload = function() {\n    let newDoc = iframe.contentDocument;\n*!*\n    // the loaded document is not the same as initial!\n    alert(oldDoc == newDoc); // false\n*/!*\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\nWe shouldn't work with the document of a not-yet-loaded iframe, because that's the *wrong document*. If we set any event handlers on it, they will be ignored.\n\nHow to detect the moment when the document is there?\n\nThe right document is definitely at place when `iframe.onload`  triggers. But it only triggers when the whole iframe with all resources is loaded.\n\nWe can try to catch the moment earlier using checks in `setInterval`:\n\n```html run\n<iframe src=\"/\" id=\"iframe\"></iframe>\n\n<script>\n  let oldDoc = iframe.contentDocument;\n\n  // every 100 ms check if the document is the new one\n  let timer = setInterval(() => {\n    let newDoc = iframe.contentDocument;\n    if (newDoc == oldDoc) return;\n\n    alert(\"New document is here!\");\n\n    clearInterval(timer); // cancel setInterval, don't need it any more\n  }, 100);\n</script>\n```\n\n## Collection: window.frames\n\nAn alternative way to get a window object for `<iframe>` -- is to get it from the named collection  `window.frames`:\n\n- By number: `window.frames[0]` -- the window object for the first frame in the document.\n- By name: `window.frames.iframeName` -- the window object for the frame with  `name=\"iframeName\"`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run\n<iframe src=\"/\" style=\"height:80px\" name=\"win\" id=\"iframe\"></iframe>\n\n<script>\n  alert(iframe.contentWindow == frames[0]); // true\n  alert(iframe.contentWindow == frames.win); // true\n</script>\n```\n\nAn iframe may have other iframes inside. The corresponding `window` objects form a hierarchy.\n\nNavigation links are:\n\n- `window.frames` -- the collection of \"children\" windows (for nested frames).\n- `window.parent` -- the reference to the \"parent\" (outer) window.\n- `window.top` -- the reference to the topmost parent window.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nwindow.frames[0].parent === window; // true\n```\n\nWe can use the `top` property to check if the current document is open inside a frame or not:\n\n```js run\nif (window == top) { // current window == window.top?\n  alert('The script is in the topmost window, not in a frame');\n} else {\n  alert('The script runs in a frame!');\n}\n```\n\n## The \"sandbox\" iframe attribute\n\nThe `sandbox` attribute allows for the exclusion of certain actions inside an `<iframe>` in order to prevent it executing untrusted code. It \"sandboxes\" the iframe by treating it as coming from another origin and/or applying other limitations.\n\nThere's a \"default set\" of restrictions applied for `<iframe sandbox src=\"...\">`. But it can be relaxed if we provide a space-separated list of restrictions that should not be applied as a value of the attribute, like this: `<iframe sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups\">`.\n\nIn other words, an empty `\"sandbox\"` attribute puts the strictest limitations possible, but we can put a space-delimited list of those that we want to lift.\n\nHere's a list of limitations:\n\n`allow-same-origin`\n: By default `\"sandbox\"` forces the \"different origin\" policy for the iframe. In other words, it makes the browser to treat the `iframe` as coming from another origin, even if its `src` points to the same site. With all implied restrictions for scripts. This option removes that feature.\n\n`allow-top-navigation`\n: Allows the `iframe` to change `parent.location`.\n\n`allow-forms`\n: Allows to submit forms from `iframe`.\n\n`allow-scripts`\n: Allows to run scripts from the `iframe`.\n\n`allow-popups`\n: Allows to `window.open` popups from the `iframe`\n\nSee [the manual](mdn:/HTML/Element/iframe) for more.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a sandboxed iframe with the default set of restrictions: `<iframe sandbox src=\"...\">`. It has some JavaScript and a form.\n\nPlease note that nothing works. So the default set is really harsh:\n\n[codetabs src=\"sandbox\" height=140]\n\n\n```smart\nThe purpose of the `\"sandbox\"` attribute is only to *add more* restrictions. It cannot remove them. In particular, it can't relax same-origin restrictions if the iframe comes from another origin.\n```\n\n## Cross-window messaging\n\nThe `postMessage` interface allows windows to talk to each other no matter which origin they are from.\n\nSo, it's a way around the \"Same Origin\" policy. It allows a window from `john-smith.com` to talk to `gmail.com` and exchange information, but only if they both agree and call corresponding JavaScript functions. That makes it safe for users.\n\nThe interface has two parts.\n\n### postMessage\n\nThe window that wants to send a message calls [postMessage](mdn:api/Window.postMessage) method of the receiving window. In other words, if we want to send the message to `win`, we should call  `win.postMessage(data, targetOrigin)`.\n\nArguments:\n\n`data`\n: The data to send. Can be any object, the data is cloned using the \"structured cloning algorithm\". IE supports only strings, so we should `JSON.stringify` complex objects to support that browser.\n\n`targetOrigin`\n: Specifies the origin for the target window, so that only a window from the given origin will get the message.\n\nThe `targetOrigin` is a safety measure. Remember, if the target window comes from another origin, we can't read it's `location` in the sender window. So we can't be sure which site is open in the intended window right now: the user could navigate away, and the sender window has no idea about it.\n\nSpecifying `targetOrigin` ensures that the window only receives the data if it's still at the right site. Important when the data is sensitive.\n\nFor instance, here `win` will only receive the message if it has a document from the origin `http://example.com`:\n\n```html no-beautify\n<iframe src=\"http://example.com\" name=\"example\">\n\n<script>\n  let win = window.frames.example;\n\n  win.postMessage(\"message\", \"http://example.com\");\n</script>\n```\n\nIf we don't want that check, we can set `targetOrigin` to `*`.\n\n```html no-beautify\n<iframe src=\"http://example.com\" name=\"example\">\n\n<script>\n  let win = window.frames.example;\n\n*!*\n  win.postMessage(\"message\", \"*\");\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\n\n### onmessage\n\nTo receive a message, the target window should have a handler on the `message` event. It triggers when `postMessage` is called (and `targetOrigin` check is successful).\n\nThe event object has special properties:\n\n`data`\n: The data from `postMessage`.\n\n`origin`\n: The origin of the sender, for instance `http://javascript.info`.\n\n`source`\n: The reference to the sender window. We can immediately `source.postMessage(...)` back if we want.\n\nTo assign that handler, we should use `addEventListener`, a short syntax `window.onmessage` does not work.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```js\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\", function(event) {\n  if (event.origin != 'http://javascript.info') {\n    // something from an unknown domain, let's ignore it\n    return;\n  }\n\n  alert( \"received: \" + event.data );\n\n  // can message back using event.source.postMessage(...)\n});\n```\n\nThe full example:\n\n[codetabs src=\"postmessage\" height=120]\n\n## Summary\n\nTo call methods and access the content of another window, we should first have a reference to it.\n\nFor popups we have these references:\n- From the opener window: `window.open` -- opens a new window and returns a reference to it,\n- From the popup: `window.opener` -- is a reference to the opener window from a popup.\n\nFor iframes, we can access parent/children windows using:\n- `window.frames` -- a collection of nested window objects,\n- `window.parent`, `window.top` are the references to parent and top windows,\n- `iframe.contentWindow` is the window inside an `<iframe>` tag.\n\nIf windows share the same origin (host, port, protocol), then windows can do whatever they want with each other.\n\nOtherwise, only possible actions are:\n- Change the `location` of another window (write-only access).\n- Post a message to it.\n\nExceptions are:\n- Windows that share the same second-level domain: `a.site.com` and `b.site.com`. Then setting `document.domain='site.com'` in both of them puts them into the \"same origin\" state.\n- If an iframe has a `sandbox` attribute, it is forcefully put into the \"different origin\" state, unless the `allow-same-origin` is specified in the attribute value. That can be used to run untrusted code in iframes from the same site.\n\nThe `postMessage` interface allows two windows with any origins to talk:\n\n1. The sender calls `targetWin.postMessage(data, targetOrigin)`.\n2. If `targetOrigin` is not `'*'`, then the browser checks if window `targetWin` has the origin `targetOrigin`.\n3. If it is so, then `targetWin` triggers the `message` event with special properties:\n    - `origin` -- the origin of the sender window (like `http://my.site.com`)\n    - `source` -- the reference to the sender window.\n    - `data` -- the data, any object in everywhere except IE that supports only strings.\n\n    We should use `addEventListener` to set the handler for this event inside the target window.",

        "content": "\n\nThe \"clickjacking\" attack allows an evil page to click on a \"victim site\" *on behalf of the visitor*.\n\nMany sites were hacked this way, including Twitter, Facebook, Paypal and other sites. They have all been fixed, of course.\n\n## The idea\n\nThe idea is very simple.\n\nHere's how clickjacking was done with Facebook:\n\n1. A visitor is lured to the evil page. It doesn't matter how.\n2. The page has a harmless-looking link on it (like \"get rich now\" or \"click here, very funny\").\n3. Over that link the evil page positions a transparent `<iframe>` with `src` from facebook.com, in such a way that the \"Like\" button is right above that link. Usually that's done with `z-index`.\n4. In attempting to click the link, the visitor in fact clicks the button.\n\n## The demo\n\nHere's how the evil page looks. To make things clear, the `<iframe>` is half-transparent (in real evil pages it's fully transparent):\n\n```html run height=120 no-beautify\n<style>\niframe { /* iframe from the victim site */\n  width: 400px;\n  height: 100px;\n  position: absolute;\n  top:0; left:-20px;\n*!*\n  opacity: 0.5; /* in real opacity:0 */\n*/!*\n  z-index: 1;\n}\n</style>\n\n<div>Click to get rich now:</div>\n\n<!-- The url from the victim site -->\n*!*\n<iframe src=\"/clickjacking/facebook.html\"></iframe>\n\n<button>Click here!</button>\n*/!*\n\n<div>...And you're cool (I'm a cool hacker actually)!</div>\n```\n\nThe full demo of the attack:\n\n[codetabs src=\"clickjacking-visible\" height=160]\n\nHere we have a half-transparent `<iframe src=\"facebook.html\">`, and in the example we can see it hovering over the button. A click on the button actually clicks on the iframe, but that's not visible to the user, because the iframe is transparent.\n\nAs a result, if the visitor is authorized on Facebook (\"remember me\" is usually turned on), then it adds a \"Like\". On Twitter that would be a \"Follow\" button.\n\nHere's the same example, but closer to reality, with `opacity:0` for `<iframe>`:\n\n[codetabs src=\"clickjacking\" height=160]\n\nAll we need to attack -- is to position the `<iframe>` on the evil page in such a way that the button is right over the link. So that when a user clicks the link, they actually click the button. That's usually doable with CSS.\n\n```smart header=\"Clickjacking is for clicks, not for keyboard\"\nThe attack only affects mouse actions (or similar, like taps on mobile).\n\nKeyboard input is much difficult to redirect. Technically, if we have a text field to hack, then we can position an iframe in such a way that text fields overlap each other. So when a visitor tries to focus on the input they see on the page, they actually focus on the input inside the iframe.\n\nBut then there's a problem. Everything that the visitor types will be hidden, because the iframe is not visible.\n\nPeople will usually stop typing when they can't see their new characters printing on the screen.\n```\n\n## Old-school defences (weak)\n\nThe oldest defence is a bit of JavaScript which forbids opening the page in a frame (so-called \"framebusting\").\n\nThat looks like this:\n\n```js\nif (top != window) {\n  top.location = window.location;\n}\n```\n\nThat is: if the window finds out that it's not on top, then it automatically makes itself the top.\n\nThis not a reliable defence, because there are many ways to hack around it. Let's cover a few.\n\n### Blocking top-navigation\n\nWe can block the transition caused by changing `top.location` in  [beforeunload](info:onload-ondomcontentloaded#window.onbeforeunload) event handler.\n\nThe top page (enclosing one, belonging to the hacker) sets a preventing handler to it, like this:\n\n```js\nwindow.onbeforeunload = function() {\n  return false;\n};\n```\n\nWhen the `iframe` tries to change `top.location`, the visitor gets a message asking them whether they want to leave.\n\nIn most cases the visitor would answer negatively because they don't know about the iframe - all they can see is the top page, there's no reason to leave. So `top.location` won't change!\n\nIn action:\n\n[codetabs src=\"top-location\"]\n\n### Sandbox attribute\n\nOne of the things restricted by the `sandbox` attribute is navigation. A sandboxed iframe may not change `top.location`.\n\nSo we can add the iframe with `sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-forms\"`. That would relax the restrictions, permitting scripts and forms. But we omit `allow-top-navigation` so that changing `top.location` is forbidden.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```html\n<iframe *!*sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-forms\"*/!* src=\"facebook.html\"></iframe>\n```\n\nThere are other ways to work around that simple protection too.\n\n## X-Frame-Options\n\nThe server-side header `X-Frame-Options` can permit or forbid displaying the page inside a frame.\n\nIt must be sent exactly as HTTP-header: the browser will ignore it if found in HTML `<meta>` tag. So, `<meta http-equiv=\"X-Frame-Options\"...>` won't do anything.\n\nThe header may have 3 values:\n\n\n`DENY`\n: Never ever show the page inside a frame.\n\n`SAMEORIGIN`\n: Allow inside a frame if the parent document comes from the same origin.\n\n`ALLOW-FROM domain`\n: Allow inside a frame if the parent document is from the given domain.\n\nFor instance, Twitter uses `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`.\n\n````online\nHere's the result:\n\n```html\n<iframe src=\"https://twitter.com\"></iframe>\n```\n\n<!-- ebook: prerender/ chrome headless dies and timeouts on this iframe -->\n<iframe src=\"https://twitter.com\"></iframe>\n\nDepending on your browser, the `iframe` above is either empty or alerting you that the browser won't permit that page to be navigating in this way.\n````\n\n## Showing with disabled functionality\n\nThe `X-Frame-Options` header has a side-effect. Other sites won't be able to show our page in a frame, even if they have good reasons to do so.\n\nSo there are other solutions... For instance, we can \"cover\" the page with a `<div>` with styles `height: 100%; width: 100%;`, so that it will intercept all clicks. That `<div>` is to be removed if `window == top` or if we figure out that we don't need the protection.\n\nSomething like this:\n\n```html\n<style>\n  #protector {\n    height: 100%;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: absolute;\n    left: 0;\n    top: 0;\n    z-index: 99999999;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<div id=\"protector\">\n  <a href=\"/\" target=\"_blank\">Go to the site</a>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n  // there will be an error if top window is from the different origin\n  // but that's ok here\n  if (top.document.domain == document.domain) {\n    protector.remove();\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\nThe demo:\n\n[codetabs src=\"protector\"]\n\n## Samesite cookie attribute\n\nThe `samesite` cookie attribute can also prevent clickjacking attacks.\n\nA cookie with such attribute is only sent to a website if it's opened directly, not via a frame, or otherwise. More information in the chapter <info:cookie#samesite>.\n\nIf the site, such as Facebook, had `samesite` attribute on its authentication cookie, like this:\n\n```\nSet-Cookie: authorization=secret; samesite\n```\n\n...Then such cookie wouldn't be sent when Facebook is open in iframe from another site. So the attack would fail.\n\nThe `samesite` cookie attribute will not have an effect when cookies are not used. This may allow other websites to easily show our public, unauthenticated pages in iframes.\n\nHowever, this may also allow clickjacking attacks to work in a few limited cases. An anonymous polling website that prevents duplicate voting by checking IP addresses, for example, would still be vulnerable to clickjacking because it does not authenticate users using cookies.\n\n## Summary\n\nClickjacking is a way to \"trick\" users into clicking on a victim site without even knowing what's happening. That's dangerous if there are important click-activated actions.\n\nA hacker can post a link to their evil page in a message, or lure visitors to their page by some other means. There are many variations.\n\nFrom one perspective -- the attack is \"not deep\": all a hacker is doing is intercepting a single click. But from another perspective, if the hacker knows that after the click another control will appear, then they may use cunning messages to coerce the user into clicking on them as well.\n\nThe attack is quite dangerous, because when we engineer the UI we usually don't anticipate that a hacker may click on behalf of the visitor. So vulnerabilities can be found in totally unexpected places.\n\n- It is recommended to use `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` on pages (or whole websites) which are not intended to be viewed inside frames.\n- Use a covering `<div>` if we want to allow our pages to be shown in iframes, but still stay safe.",

        "content": "\n\nIn web-development we meet binary data mostly while dealing with files (create, upload, download). Another typical use case is image processing.\n\nThat's all possible in JavaScript, and binary operations are high-performant.\n\nAlthough, there's a bit of confusion, because there are many classes. To name a few:\n- `ArrayBuffer`, `Uint8Array`, `DataView`, `Blob`, `File`, etc.\n\nBinary data in JavaScript is implemented in a non-standard way, compared to other languages. But when we sort things out, everything becomes fairly simple.\n\n**The basic binary object is `ArrayBuffer` -- a reference to a fixed-length contiguous memory area.**\n\nWe create it like this:\n```js run\nlet buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16); // create a buffer of length 16\nalert(buffer.byteLength); // 16\n```\n\nThis allocates a contiguous memory area of 16 bytes and pre-fills it with zeroes.\n\n```warn header=\"`ArrayBuffer` is not an array of something\"\nLet's eliminate a possible source of confusion. `ArrayBuffer` has nothing in common with `Array`:\n- It has a fixed length, we can't increase or decrease it.\n- It takes exactly that much space in the memory.\n- To access individual bytes, another \"view\" object is needed, not `buffer[index]`.\n```\n\n`ArrayBuffer` is a memory area. What's stored in it? It has no clue. Just a raw sequence of bytes.\n\n**To manipulate an `ArrayBuffer`, we need to use a \"view\" object.**\n\nA view object does not store anything on it's own. It's the \"eyeglasses\" that give an interpretation of the bytes stored in the `ArrayBuffer`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- **`Uint8Array`** -- treats each byte in `ArrayBuffer` as a separate number, with possible values are from 0 to 255 (a byte is 8-bit, so it can hold only that much). Such value is called a \"8-bit unsigned integer\".\n- **`Uint16Array`** -- treats every 2 bytes as an integer, with possible values from 0 to 65535. That's called a \"16-bit unsigned integer\".\n- **`Uint32Array`** -- treats every 4 bytes as an integer, with possible values from 0 to 4294967295. That's called a \"32-bit unsigned integer\".\n- **`Float64Array`** -- treats every 8 bytes as a floating point number with possible values from <code>5.0x10<sup>-324</sup></code> to <code>1.8x10<sup>308</sup></code>.\n\nSo, the binary data in an `ArrayBuffer` of 16 bytes can be interpreted as 16 \"tiny numbers\", or 8 bigger numbers (2 bytes each), or 4 even bigger (4 bytes each), or 2 floating-point values with high precision (8 bytes each).\n\n![](arraybuffer-views.svg)\n\n`ArrayBuffer` is the core object, the root of everything, the raw binary data.\n\nBut if we're going to write into it, or iterate over it, basically for almost any operation – we must use a view, e.g:\n\n```js run\nlet buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16); // create a buffer of length 16\n\n*!*\nlet view = new Uint32Array(buffer); // treat buffer as a sequence of 32-bit integers\n\nalert(Uint32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT); // 4 bytes per integer\n*/!*\n\nalert(view.length); // 4, it stores that many integers\nalert(view.byteLength); // 16, the size in bytes\n\n// let's write a value\nview[0] = 123456;\n\n// iterate over values\nfor(let num of view) {\n  alert(num); // 123456, then 0, 0, 0 (4 values total)\n}\n\n```\n\n## TypedArray\n\nThe common term for all these views (`Uint8Array`, `Uint32Array`, etc) is [TypedArray](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-typedarray-objects). They share the same set of methods and properities.\n\nPlease note, there's no constructor called `TypedArray`, it's just a common \"umbrella\" term to represent one of views over `ArrayBuffer`: `Int8Array`, `Uint8Array` and so on, the full list will soon follow.\n\nWhen you see something like `new TypedArray`, it means any of `new Int8Array`, `new Uint8Array`, etc.\n\nTyped array behave like regular arrays: have indexes and iterable.\n\nA typed array constructor (be it `Int8Array` or `Float64Array`, doesn't matter) behaves differently depending on argument types.\n\nThere are 5 variants of arguments:\n\n```js\nnew TypedArray(buffer, [byteOffset], [length]);\nnew TypedArray(object);\nnew TypedArray(typedArray);\nnew TypedArray(length);\nnew TypedArray();\n```\n\n1. If an `ArrayBuffer` argument is supplied, the view is created over it. We used that syntax already.\n\n    Optionally we can provide `byteOffset` to start from (0 by default) and the `length` (till the end of the buffer by default), then the view will cover only a part of the `buffer`.\n\n2. If an `Array`, or any array-like object is given, it creates a typed array of the same length and copies the content.\n\n    We can use it to pre-fill the array with the data:\n    ```js run\n    *!*\n    let arr = new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2, 3]);\n    */!*\n    alert( arr.length ); // 4, created binary array of the same length\n    alert( arr[1] ); // 1, filled with 4 bytes (unsigned 8-bit integers) with given values\n    ```\n3. If another `TypedArray` is supplied, it does the same: creates a typed array of the same length and copies values. Values are converted to the new type in the process, if needed.\n    ```js run\n    let arr16 = new Uint16Array([1, 1000]);\n    *!*\n    let arr8 = new Uint8Array(arr16);\n    */!*\n    alert( arr8[0] ); // 1\n    alert( arr8[1] ); // 232, tried to copy 1000, but can't fit 1000 into 8 bits (explanations below)\n    ```\n\n4. For a numeric argument `length` -- creates the typed array to contain that many elements. Its byte length will be `length` multiplied by the number of bytes in a single item `TypedArray.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT`:\n    ```js run\n    let arr = new Uint16Array(4); // create typed array for 4 integers\n    alert( Uint16Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT ); // 2 bytes per integer\n    alert( arr.byteLength ); // 8 (size in bytes)\n    ```\n\n5. Without arguments, creates an zero-length typed array.\n\nWe can create a `TypedArray` directly, without mentioning `ArrayBuffer`. But a view cannot exist without an underlying `ArrayBuffer`, so gets created automatically in all these cases except the first one (when provided).\n\nTo access the `ArrayBuffer`, there are properties:\n- `arr.buffer` -- references the `ArrayBuffer`.\n- `arr.byteLength` -- the length of the `ArrayBuffer`.\n\nSo, we can always move from one view to another:\n```js\nlet arr8 = new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2, 3]);\n\n// another view on the same data\nlet arr16 = new Uint16Array(arr8.buffer);\n```\n\n\nHere's the list of typed arrays:\n\n- `Uint8Array`, `Uint16Array`, `Uint32Array` -- for integer numbers of 8, 16 and 32 bits.\n  - `Uint8ClampedArray` -- for 8-bit integers, \"clamps\" them on assignment (see below).\n- `Int8Array`, `Int16Array`, `Int32Array` -- for signed integer numbers (can be negative).\n- `Float32Array`, `Float64Array` -- for signed floating-point numbers of 32 and 64 bits.\n\n```warn header=\"No `int8` or similar single-valued types\"\nPlease note, despite of the names like `Int8Array`, there's no single-value type like `int`, or `int8` in JavaScript.\n\nThat's logical, as `Int8Array` is not an array of these individual values, but rather a view on `ArrayBuffer`.\n```\n\n### Out-of-bounds behavior\n\nWhat if we attempt to write an out-of-bounds value into a typed array? There will be no error. But extra bits are cut-off.\n\nFor instance, let's try to put 256 into `Uint8Array`. In binary form, 256 is `100000000` (9 bits), but `Uint8Array` only provides 8 bits per value, that makes the available range from 0 to 255.\n\nFor bigger numbers, only the rightmost (less significant) 8 bits are stored, and the rest is cut off:\n\n![](8bit-integer-256.svg)\n\nSo we'll get zero.\n\nFor 257, the binary form is `100000001` (9 bits), the rightmost 8 get stored, so we'll have `1` in the array:\n\n![](8bit-integer-257.svg)\n\nIn other words, the number modulo 2<sup>8</sup> is saved.\n\nHere's the demo:\n\n```js run\nlet uint8array = new Uint8Array(16);\n\nlet num = 256;\nalert(num.toString(2)); // 100000000 (binary representation)\n\nuint8array[0] = 256;\nuint8array[1] = 257;\n\nalert(uint8array[0]); // 0\nalert(uint8array[1]); // 1\n```\n\n`Uint8ClampedArray` is special in this aspect, its behavior is different. It saves 255 for any number that is greater than 255, and 0 for any negative number. That behavior is useful for image processing.\n\n## TypedArray methods\n\n`TypedArray` has regular `Array` methods, with notable exceptions.\n\nWe can iterate, `map`, `slice`, `find`, `reduce` etc.\n\nThere are few things we can't do though:\n\n- No `splice` -- we can't \"delete\" a value, because typed arrays are views on a buffer, and these are fixed, contiguous areas of memory. All we can do is to assign a zero.\n- No `concat` method.\n\nThere are two additional methods:\n\n- `arr.set(fromArr, [offset])` copies all elements from `fromArr` to the `arr`, starting at position `offset` (0 by default).\n- `arr.subarray([begin, end])` creates a new view of the same type from `begin` to `end` (exclusive). That's similar to `slice` method (that's also supported), but doesn't copy anything -- just creates a new view, to operate on the given piece of data.\n\nThese methods allow us to copy typed arrays, mix them, create new arrays from existing ones, and so on.\n\n\n\n## DataView\n\n[DataView](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView) is a special super-flexible \"untyped\" view over `ArrayBuffer`. It allows to access the data on any offset in any format.\n\n- For typed arrays, the constructor dictates what the format is. The whole array is supposed to be uniform. The i-th number is `arr[i]`.\n- With `DataView` we access the data with methods like `.getUint8(i)` or `.getUint16(i)`. We choose the format at method call time instead of the construction time.\n\nThe syntax:\n\n```js\nnew DataView(buffer, [byteOffset], [byteLength])\n```\n\n- **`buffer`** -- the underlying `ArrayBuffer`. Unlike typed arrays, `DataView` doesn't create a buffer on its own. We need to have it ready.\n- **`byteOffset`** -- the starting byte position of the view (by default 0).\n- **`byteLength`** -- the byte length of the view (by default till the end of `buffer`).\n\nFor instance, here we extract numbers in different formats from the same buffer:\n\n```js run\n// binary array of 4 bytes, all have the maximal value 255\nlet buffer = new Uint8Array([255, 255, 255, 255]).buffer;\n\nlet dataView = new DataView(buffer);\n\n// get 8-bit number at offset 0\nalert( dataView.getUint8(0) ); // 255\n\n// now get 16-bit number at offset 0, it consists of 2 bytes, together iterpreted as 65535\nalert( dataView.getUint16(0) ); // 65535 (biggest 16-bit unsigned int)\n\n// get 32-bit number at offset 0\nalert( dataView.getUint32(0) ); // 4294967295 (biggest 32-bit unsigned int)\n\ndataView.setUint32(0, 0); // set 4-byte number to zero, thus setting all bytes to 0\n```\n\n`DataView` is great when we store mixed-format data in the same buffer. E.g we store a sequence of pairs (16-bit integer, 32-bit float). Then `DataView` allows to access them easily.\n\n## Summary\n\n`ArrayBuffer` is the core object, a reference to the fixed-length contiguous memory area.\n\nTo do almost any operation on `ArrayBuffer`, we need a view.\n\n- It can be a `TypedArray`:\n    - `Uint8Array`, `Uint16Array`, `Uint32Array` -- for unsigned integers of 8, 16, and 32 bits.\n    - `Uint8ClampedArray` -- for 8-bit integers, \"clamps\" them on assignment.\n    - `Int8Array`, `Int16Array`, `Int32Array` -- for signed integer numbers (can be negative).\n    - `Float32Array`, `Float64Array` -- for signed floating-point numbers of 32 and 64 bits.\n- Or a `DataView` -- the view that uses methods to specify a format, e.g. `getUint8(offset)`.\n\nIn most cases we create and operate directly on typed arrays, leaving `ArrayBuffer` under cover, as a \"common discriminator\". We can access it as `.buffer` and make another view if needed.\n\nThere are also two additional terms, that are used in descriptions of methods that operate on binary data:\n- `ArrayBufferView` is an umbrella term for all these kinds of views.\n- `BufferSource` is an umbrella term for `ArrayBuffer` or `ArrayBufferView`.\n\nWe'll see these terms in the next chapters. `BufferSource` is one of the most common terms, as it means \"any kind of binary data\" -- an `ArrayBuffer` or a view over it.\n\nHere's a cheatsheet:\n\n![](arraybuffer-view-buffersource.svg)",

By default `\"transparent\"` (do nothing), but also can be `\"native\"` (transform).\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\n// create Blob from a string\nlet blob = new Blob([\"<html>…</html>\"], {type: 'text/html'});\n// please note: the first argument must be an array [...]\n```\n\n```js\n// create Blob from a typed array and strings\nlet hello = new Uint8Array([72, 101, 108, 108, 111]); // \"Hello\" in binary form\n\nlet blob = new Blob([hello, ' ', 'world'], {type: 'text/plain'});\n```\n\n\nWe can extract `Blob` slices with:\n\n```js\nblob.slice([byteStart], [byteEnd], [contentType]);\n```\n\n- **`byteStart`** -- the starting byte, by default 0.\n- **`byteEnd`** -- the last byte (exclusive, by default till the end).\n- **`contentType`** -- the `type` of the new blob, by default the same as the source.\n\nThe arguments are similar to `array.slice`, negative numbers are allowed too.\n\n```smart header=\"`Blob` objects are immutable\"\nWe can't change data directly in a `Blob`, but we can slice parts of a `Blob`, create new `Blob` objects from them, mix them into a new `Blob` and so on.\n\nThis behavior is similar to JavaScript strings: we can't change a character in a string, but we can make a new corrected string.\n```\n\n## Blob as URL\n\nA Blob can be easily used as an URL for `<a>`, `<img>` or other tags, to show its contents.\n\nThanks to `type`, we can also download/upload `Blob` objects, and the `type` naturally becomes `Content-Type` in network requests.\n\nLet's start with a simple example. By clicking on a link you download a dynamically-generated `Blob` with `hello world` contents as a file:\n\n```html run\n<!-- download attribute forces the browser to download instead of navigating -->\n<a download=\"hello.txt\" href='#' id=\"link\">Download</a>\n\n<script>\nlet blob = new Blob([\"Hello, world!\"], {type: 'text/plain'});\n\nlink.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n</script>\n```\n\nWe can also create a link dynamically in JavaScript and simulate a click by `link.click()`, then download starts automatically.\n\nHere's the similar code that causes user to download the dynamicallly created `Blob`, without any HTML:\n\n```js run\nlet link = document.createElement('a');\nlink.download = 'hello.txt';\n\nlet blob = new Blob(['Hello, world!'], {type: 'text/plain'});\n\nlink.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n\nlink.click();\n\nURL.revokeObjectURL(link.href);\n```\n\n`URL.createObjectURL` takes a `Blob` and creates a unique URL for it, in the form `blob:<origin>/<uuid>`.\n\nThat's what the value of `link.href` looks like:\n\n```\nblob:https://javascript.info/1e67e00e-860d-40a5-89ae-6ab0cbee6273\n```\n\nThe browser for each URL generated by `URL.createObjectURL` stores an the URL -> `Blob` mapping internally. So such URLs are short, but allow to access the `Blob`.\n\nA generated URL (and hence the link with it) is only valid within the current document, while it's open. And it allows to reference the `Blob` in `<img>`, `<a>`, basically any other object that expects an url.\n\nThere's a side-effect though. While there's a mapping for a `Blob`, the `Blob` itself resides in the memory. The browser can't free it.\n\nThe mapping is automatically cleared on document unload, so `Blob` objects are freed then. But if an app is long-living, then that doesn't happen soon.\n\n**So if we create a URL, that `Blob` will hang in memory, even if not needed any more.**\n\n`URL.revokeObjectURL(url)` removes the reference from the internal mapping, thus allowing the `Blob` to be deleted (if there are no other references), and the memory to be freed.\n\nIn the last example, we intend the `Blob` to be used only once, for instant downloading, so we call `URL.revokeObjectURL(link.href)` immediately.\n\nIn the previous example with the clickable HTML-link, we don't call `URL.revokeObjectURL(link.href)`, because that would make the `Blob` url invalid. After the revocation, as the mapping is removed, the URL doesn't work any more.\n\n## Blob to base64\n\nAn alternative to `URL.createObjectURL` is to convert a `Blob` into a base64-encoded string.\n\nThat encoding represents binary data as a string of ultra-safe \"readable\" characters with ASCII-codes from 0 to 64. And what's more important -- we can use this encoding in \"data-urls\".\n\nA [data url](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) has the form `data:[<mediatype>][;base64],<data>`. We can use such urls everywhere, on par with \"regular\" urls.\n\nFor instance, here's a smiley:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhDAAMAKIFAF5LAP/zxAAAANyuAP/gaP///wAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAUALAAAAAAMAAwAAAMlWLPcGjDKFYi9lxKBOaGcF35DhWHamZUW0K4mAbiwWtuf0uxFAgA7\">\n```\n\nThe browser will decode the string and show the image: <img src=\"data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhDAAMAKIFAF5LAP/zxAAAANyuAP/gaP///wAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAUALAAAAAAMAAwAAAMlWLPcGjDKFYi9lxKBOaGcF35DhWHamZUW0K4mAbiwWtuf0uxFAgA7\">\n\n\nTo transform a `Blob` into base64, we'll use the built-in `FileReader` object. It can read data from Blobs in multiple formats. In the [next chapter](info:file) we'll cover it more in-depth.\n\nHere's the demo of downloading a blob, now via base-64:\n\n```js run\nlet link = document.createElement('a');\nlink.download = 'hello.txt';\n\nlet blob = new Blob(['Hello, world!'], {type: 'text/plain'});\n\n*!*\nlet reader = new FileReader();\nreader.readAsDataURL(blob); // converts the blob to base64 and calls onload\n*/!*\n\nreader.onload = function() {\n  link.href = reader.result; // data url\n  link.click();\n};\n```\n\nBoth ways of making an URL of a `Blob` are usable. But usually `URL.createObjectURL(blob)` is simpler and faster.\n\n```compare title-plus=\"URL.createObjectURL(blob)\" title-minus=\"Blob to data url\"\n+ We need to revoke them if care about memory.\n+ Direct access to blob, no \"encoding/decoding\"\n- No need to revoke anything.\n- Performance and memory losses on big `Blob` objects for encoding.\n```\n\n## Image to blob\n\nWe can create a `Blob` of an image, an image part, or even make a page screenshot. That's handy to upload it somewhere.\n\nImage operations are done via `<canvas>` element:\n\n1. Draw an image (or its part) on canvas using [canvas.drawImage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/drawImage).\n2. Call canvas method [.toBlob(callback, format, quality)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toBlob) that creates a `Blob` and runs `callback` with it when done.\n\nIn the example below, an image is just copied, but we could cut from it, or transform it on canvas prior to making a blob:\n\n```js run\n// take any image\nlet img = document.querySelector('img');\n\n// make <canvas> of the same size\nlet canvas = document.createElement('canvas');\ncanvas.width = img.clientWidth;\ncanvas.height = img.clientHeight;\n\nlet context = canvas.getContext('2d');\n\n// copy image to it (this method allows to cut image)\ncontext.drawImage(img, 0, 0);\n// we can context.rotate(), and do many other things on canvas\n\n// toBlob is async opereation, callback is called when done\ncanvas.toBlob(function(blob) {\n  // blob ready, download it\n  let link = document.createElement('a');\n  link.download = 'example.png';\n\n  link.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n  link.click();\n\n  // delete the internal blob reference, to let the browser clear memory from it\n  URL.revokeObjectURL(link.href);\n}, 'image/png');\n```\n\nIf we prefer `async/await` instead of callbacks:\n```js\nlet blob = await new Promise(resolve => canvasElem.toBlob(resolve, 'image/png'));\n```\n\nFor screenshotting a page, we can use a library such as <https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas>. What it does is just walks the page and draws it on `<canvas>`. Then we can get a `Blob` of it the same way as above.\n\n## From Blob to ArrayBuffer\n\nThe `Blob` constructor allows to create a blob from almost anything, including any `BufferSource`.\n\nBut if we need to perform low-level processing, we can get the lowest-level `ArrayBuffer` from it using `FileReader`:\n\n```js\n// get arrayBuffer from blob\nlet fileReader = new FileReader();\n\n*!*\nfileReader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob);\n*/!*\n\nfileReader.onload = function(event) {\n  let arrayBuffer = fileReader.result;\n};\n```\n\n\n## Summary\n\nWhile `ArrayBuffer`, `Uint8Array` and other `BufferSource` are \"binary data\", a [Blob](https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-Blob) represents \"binary data with type\".\n\nThat makes Blobs convenient for upload/download operations, that are so common in the browser.\n\nMethods that perform web-requests, such as [XMLHttpRequest](info:xmlhttprequest), [fetch](info:fetch) and so on, can work with `Blob` natively, as well as with other binary types.\n\nWe can easily convert betweeen `Blob` and low-level binary data types:\n\n- We can make a Blob from a typed array using `new Blob(...)` constructor.\n- We can get back `ArrayBuffer` from a Blob using `FileReader`, and then create a view over it for low-level binary processing.",

        "content": "\n\nA [File](https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-file) object inherits from `Blob` and is extended with filesystem-related capabilities.\n\nThere are two ways to obtain it.\n\nFirst, there's a constructor, similar to `Blob`:\n\n```js\nnew File(fileParts, fileName, [options])\n```\n\n- **`fileParts`** -- is an array of Blob/BufferSource/String values.\n- **`fileName`** -- file name string.\n- **`options`** -- optional object:\n    - **`lastModified`** -- the timestamp (integer date) of last modification.\n\nSecond, more often we get a file from `<input type=\"file\">` or drag'n'drop or other browser interfaces. In that case, the file gets this information from OS.\n\nAs `File` inherits from `Blob`, `File` objects have the same properties, plus:\n- `name` -- the file name,\n- `lastModified` -- the timestamp of last modification.\n\nThat's how we can get a `File` object from `<input type=\"file\">`:\n\n```html run\n<input type=\"file\" onchange=\"showFile(this)\">\n\n<script>\nfunction showFile(input) {\n  let file = input.files[0];\n\n  alert(`File name: ${file.name}`); // e.g my.png\n  alert(`Last modified: ${file.lastModified}`); // e.g 1552830408824\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n```smart\nThe input may select multiple files, so `input.files` is an array-like object with them. Here we have only one file, so we just take `input.files[0]`.\n```\n\n## FileReader\n\n[FileReader](https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-filereader) is an object with the sole purpose of reading data from `Blob` (and hence `File` too) objects.\n\nIt delivers the data using events, as reading from disk may take time.\n\nThe constructor:\n\n```js\nlet reader = new FileReader(); // no arguments\n```\n\nThe main methods:\n\n- **`readAsArrayBuffer(blob)`** -- read the data in binary format `ArrayBuffer`.\n- **`readAsText(blob, [encoding])`** -- read the data as a text string with the given encoding (`utf-8` by default).\n- **`readAsDataURL(blob)`** -- read the binary data and encode it as base64 data url.\n- **`abort()`** -- cancel the operation.\n\nThe choice of `read*` method depends on which format we prefer, how we're going to use the data.\n\n- `readAsArrayBuffer` -- for binary files, to do low-level binary operations. For high-level operations, like slicing, `File` inherits from `Blob`, so we can call them directly, without reading.\n- `readAsText` -- for text files, when we'd like to get a string.\n- `readAsDataURL` -- when we'd like to use this data in `src` for `img` or another tag. There's an alternative to reading a file for that, as discussed in chapter <info:blob>: `URL.createObjectURL(file)`.\n\nAs the reading proceeds, there are events:\n- `loadstart` -- loading started.\n- `progress` -- occurs during reading.\n- `load` -- no errors, reading complete.\n- `abort` -- `abort()` called.\n- `error` -- error has occurred.\n- `loadend` -- reading finished with either success or failure.\n\nWhen the reading is finished, we can access the result as:\n- `reader.result` is the result (if successful)\n- `reader.error` is the error (if failed).\n\nThe most widely used events are for sure `load` and `error`.\n\nHere's an example of reading a file:\n\n```html run\n<input type=\"file\" onchange=\"readFile(this)\">\n\n<script>\nfunction readFile(input) {\n  let file = input.files[0];\n\n  let reader = new FileReader();\n\n  reader.readAsText(file);\n\n  reader.onload = function() {\n    console.log(reader.result);\n  };\n\n  reader.onerror = function() {\n    console.log(reader.error);\n  };\n\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n```smart header=\"`FileReader` for blobs\"\nAs mentioned in the chapter <info:blob>, `FileReader` can read not just files, but any blobs.\n\nWe can use it to convert a blob to another format:\n- `readAsArrayBuffer(blob)` -- to `ArrayBuffer`,\n- `readAsText(blob, [encoding])` -- to string (an alternative to `TextDecoder`),\n- `readAsDataURL(blob)` -- to base64 data url.\n```\n\n\n```smart header=\"`FileReaderSync` is available inside Web Workers\"\nFor Web Workers, there also exists a synchronous variant of `FileReader`, called [FileReaderSync](https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#FileReaderSync).\n\nIts reading methods `read*` do not generate events, but rather return a result, as regular functions do.\n\nThat's only inside a Web Worker though, because delays in synchronous calls, that are possible while reading from files, in Web Workers are less important. They do not affect the page.\n```\n\n## Summary\n\n`File` objects inherit from `Blob`.\n\nIn addition to `Blob` methods and properties, `File` objects also have `name` and `lastModified` properties, plus the internal ability to read from filesystem. We usually get `File` objects from user input, like `<input>` or Drag'n'Drop events (`ondragend`).\n\n`FileReader` objects can read from a file or a blob, in one of three formats:\n- String (`readAsText`).\n- `ArrayBuffer` (`readAsArrayBuffer`).\n- Data url, base-64 encoded (`readAsDataURL`).\n\nIn many cases though, we don't have to read the file contents. Just as we did with blobs, we can create a short url with `URL.createObjectURL(file)` and assign it to `<a>` or `<img>`. This way the file can be downloaded or shown up as an image, as a part of canvas etc.\n\nAnd if we're going to send a `File` over a network, that's also easy: network API like `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch` natively accepts `File` objects.",

        "content": "\n\nJavaScript can send network requests to the server and load new information whenever it's needed.\n\nFor example, we can use a network request to:\n\n- Submit an order,\n- Load user information,\n- Receive latest updates from the server,\n- ...etc.\n\n...And all of that without reloading the page!\n\nThere's an umbrella term \"AJAX\" (abbreviated <b>A</b>synchronous <b>J</b>avaScript <b>A</b>nd <b>X</b>ML) for network requests from JavaScript. We don't have to use XML though: the term comes from old times, that's why that word is there. You may have heard that term already.\n\nThere are multiple ways to send a network request and get information from the server.\n\nThe `fetch()` method is modern and versatile, so we'll start with it. It's not supported by old browsers (can be polyfilled), but very well supported among the modern ones.\n\nThe basic syntax is:\n\n```js\nlet promise = fetch(url, [options])\n```\n\n- **`url`** -- the URL to access.\n- **`options`** -- optional parameters: method, headers etc.\n\nWithout `options`, that is a simple GET request, downloading the contents of the `url`.\n\nThe browser starts the request right away and returns a promise that the calling code should use to get the result.\n\nGetting a response is usually a two-stage process.\n\n**First, the `promise`, returned by `fetch`, resolves with an object of the built-in [Response](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#response-class) class as soon as the server responds with headers.**\n\nAt this stage we can check HTTP status, to see whether it is successful or not, check headers, but don't have the body yet.\n\nThe promise rejects if the `fetch` was unable to make HTTP-request, e.g. network problems, or there's no such site. Abnormal HTTP-statuses, such as 404 or 500 do not cause an error.\n\nWe can see HTTP-status in response properties:\n\n- **`status`** -- HTTP status code, e.g. 200.\n- **`ok`** -- boolean, `true` if the HTTP status code is 200-299.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nlet response = await fetch(url);\n\nif (response.ok) { // if HTTP-status is 200-299\n  // get the response body (the method explained below)\n  let json = await response.json();\n} else {\n  alert(\"HTTP-Error: \" + response.status);\n}\n```\n\n**Second, to get the response body, we need to use an additional method call.**\n\n`Response` provides multiple promise-based methods to access the body in various formats:\n\n- **`response.text()`** -- read the response and return as text,\n- **`response.json()`** -- parse the response as JSON,\n- **`response.formData()`** -- return the response as `FormData` object (explained in the [next chapter](info:formdata)),\n- **`response.blob()`** -- return the response as [Blob](info:blob) (binary data with type),\n- **`response.arrayBuffer()`** -- return the response as [ArrayBuffer](info:arraybuffer-binary-arrays) (low-level representaion of binary data),\n- additionally, `response.body` is a [ReadableStream](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#rs-class) object, it allows you to read the body chunk-by-chunk, we'll see an example later.\n\nFor instance, let's get a JSON-object with latest commits from GitHub:\n\n```js run async\nlet url = 'https://api.github.com/repos/javascript-tutorial/en.javascript.info/commits';\nlet response = await fetch(url);\n\n*!*\nlet commits = await response.json(); // read response body and parse as JSON\n*/!*\n\nalert(commits[0].author.login);\n```\n\nOr, the same without `await`, using pure promises syntax:\n\n```js run\nfetch('https://api.github.com/repos/javascript-tutorial/en.javascript.info/commits')\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(commits => alert(commits[0].author.login));\n```\n\nTo get the response text, `await response.text()` instead of `.json()`:\n\n```js run async\nlet response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/javascript-tutorial/en.javascript.info/commits');\n\nlet text = await response.text(); // read response body as text\n\nalert(text.slice(0, 80) + '...');\n```\n\nAs a show-case for reading in binary format, let's fetch and show a logo image of [\"fetch\" specification](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org) (see chapter [Blob](info:blob) for details about operations on `Blob`):\n\n```js async run\nlet response = await fetch('/article/fetch/logo-fetch.svg');\n\n*!*\nlet blob = await response.blob(); // download as Blob object\n*/!*\n\n// create <img> for it\nlet img = document.createElement('img');\nimg.style = 'position:fixed;top:10px;left:10px;width:100px';\ndocument.body.append(img);\n\n// show it\nimg.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n\nsetTimeout(() => { // hide after three seconds\n  img.remove();\n  URL.revokeObjectURL(img.src);\n}, 3000);\n```\n\n````warn\nWe can choose only one body-reading method.\n\nIf we've already got the response with `response.text()`, then `response.json()` won't work, as the body content has already been processed.\n\n```js\nlet text = await response.text(); // response body consumed\nlet parsed = await response.json(); // fails (already consumed)\n```\n````\n\n## Response headers\n\nThe response headers are available in a Map-like headers object in `response.headers`.\n\nIt's not exactly a Map, but it has similar methods to get individual headers by name or iterate over them:\n\n```js run async\nlet response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/javascript-tutorial/en.javascript.info/commits');\n\n// get one header\nalert(response.headers.get('Content-Type')); // application/json; charset=utf-8\n\n// iterate over all headers\nfor (let [key, value] of response.headers) {\n  alert(`${key} = ${value}`);\n}\n```\n\n## Request headers\n\nTo set a request header in `fetch`, we can use the `headers` option. It has an object with outgoing headers, like this:\n\n```js\nlet response = fetch(protectedUrl, {\n  headers: {\n    Authentication: 'secret'\n  }\n});\n```\n\n...But there's a list of [forbidden HTTP headers](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#forbidden-header-name) that we can't set:\n\n- `Accept-Charset`, `Accept-Encoding`\n- `Access-Control-Request-Headers`\n- `Access-Control-Request-Method`\n- `Connection`\n- `Content-Length`\n- `Cookie`, `Cookie2`\n- `Date`\n- `DNT`\n- `Expect`\n- `Host`\n- `Keep-Alive`\n- `Origin`\n- `Referer`\n- `TE`\n- `Trailer`\n- `Transfer-Encoding`\n- `Upgrade`\n- `Via`\n- `Proxy-*`\n- `Sec-*`\n\nThese headers ensure proper and safe HTTP, so they are controlled exclusively by the browser.\n\n## POST requests\n\nTo make a `POST` request, or a request with another method, we need to use `fetch` options:\n\n- **`method`** -- HTTP-method, e.g. `POST`,\n- **`body`** -- the request body, one of:\n  - a string (e.g. JSON-encoded),\n  - `FormData` object, to submit the data as `form/multipart`,\n  - `Blob`/`BufferSource` to send binary data,\n  - [URLSearchParams](info:url), to submit the data in `x-www-form-urlencoded` encoding, rarely used.\n\nThe JSON format is used most of the time.\n\nFor example, this code submits `user` object as JSON:\n\n```js run async\nlet user = {\n  name: 'John',\n  surname: 'Smith'\n};\n\n*!*\nlet response = await fetch('/article/fetch/post/user', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json;charset=utf-8'\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify(user)\n});\n*/!*\n\nlet result = await response.json();\nalert(result.message);\n```\n\nPlease note, if the request `body` is a string, then `Content-Type` header is set to `text/plain;charset=UTF-8` by default.\n\nBut, as we're going to send JSON, we use `headers` option to send `application/json` instead, the correct `Content-Type` for JSON-encoded data.\n\n## Sending an image\n\nWe can also submit binary data with `fetch` using `Blob` or `BufferSource` objects.\n\nIn this example, there's a `<canvas>` where we can draw by moving a mouse over it. A click on the \"submit\" button sends the image to the server:\n\n```html run autorun height=\"90\"\n<body style=\"margin:0\">\n  <canvas id=\"canvasElem\" width=\"100\" height=\"80\" style=\"border:1px solid\"></canvas>\n\n  <input type=\"button\" value=\"Submit\" onclick=\"submit()\">\n\n  <script>\n    canvasElem.onmousemove = function(e) {\n      let ctx = canvasElem.getContext('2d');\n      ctx.lineTo(e.clientX, e.clientY);\n      ctx.stroke();\n    };\n\n    async function submit() {\n      let blob = await new Promise(resolve => canvasElem.toBlob(resolve, 'image/png'));\n      let response = await fetch('/article/fetch/post/image', {\n        method: 'POST',\n        body: blob\n      });\n\n      // the server responds with confirmation and the image size\n      let result = await response.json();\n      alert(result.message);\n    }\n\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\nPlease note, here we don't set `Content-Type` header manually, because a `Blob` object has a built-in type (here `image/png`, as generated by `toBlob`). For `Blob` objects that type becomes the value of `Content-Type`.\n\nThe `submit()` function can be rewritten without `async/await` like this:\n\n```js\nfunction submit() {\n  canvasElem.toBlob(function(blob) {        \n    fetch('/article/fetch/post/image', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      body: blob\n    })\n      .then(response => response.json())\n      .then(result => alert(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2)))\n  }, 'image/png');\n}\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nA typical fetch request consists of two `await` calls:\n\n```js\nlet response = await fetch(url, options); // resolves with response headers\nlet result = await response.json(); // read body as json\n```\n\nOr, without `await`:\n\n```js\nfetch(url, options)\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(result => /* process result */)\n```\n\nResponse properties:\n- `response.status` -- HTTP code of the response,\n- `response.ok` -- `true` is the status is 200-299.\n- `response.headers` -- Map-like object with HTTP headers.\n\nMethods to get response body:\n- **`response.text()`** -- return the response as text,\n- **`response.json()`** -- parse the response as JSON object,\n- **`response.formData()`** -- return the response as `FormData` object (form/multipart encoding, see the next chapter),\n- **`response.blob()`** -- return the response as [Blob](info:blob) (binary data with type),\n- **`response.arrayBuffer()`** -- return the response as [ArrayBuffer](info:arraybuffer-binary-arrays) (low-level binary data),\n\nFetch options so far:\n- `method` -- HTTP-method,\n- `headers` -- an object with request headers (not any header is allowed),\n- `body` -- the data to send (request body) as `string`, `FormData`, `BufferSource`, `Blob` or `UrlSearchParams` object.\n\nIn the next chapters we'll see more options and use cases of `fetch`.",

        "content": "\n\nThis chapter is about sending HTML forms: with or without files, with additional fields and so on.\n\n[FormData](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-formdata) objects can help with that. As you might have guessed, it's the object to represent HTML form data.\n\nThe constructor is:\n```js\nlet formData = new FormData([form]);\n```\n\nIf HTML `form` element is provided, it automatically captures its fields.\n\nThe special thing about `FormData` is that network methods, such as `fetch`, can accept a `FormData` object as a body. It's encoded and sent out with `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`.\n\nFrom the server point of view, that looks like a usual form submission.\n\n## Sending a simple form\n\nLet's send a simple form first.\n\nAs you can see, that's almost one-liner:\n\n```html run autorun\n<form id=\"formElem\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" value=\"John\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"surname\" value=\"Smith\">\n  <input type=\"submit\">\n</form>\n\n<script>\n  formElem.onsubmit = async (e) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n\n    let response = await fetch('/article/formdata/post/user', {\n      method: 'POST',\n*!*\n      body: new FormData(formElem)\n*/!*\n    });\n\n    let result = await response.json();\n\n    alert(result.message);\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\nIn this example, the server code is not presented, as it's beyound our scope. The server accepts the POST request and replies \"User saved\".\n\n## FormData Methods\n\nWe can modify fields in `FormData` with methods:\n\n- `formData.append(name, value)` - add a form field with the given `name` and `value`,\n- `formData.append(name, blob, fileName)` - add a field as if it were `<input type=\"file\">`, the third argument `fileName` sets file name (not form field name), as it were a name of the file in user's filesystem,\n- `formData.delete(name)` - remove the field with the given `name`,\n- `formData.get(name)` - get the value of the field with the given `name`,\n- `formData.has(name)` - if there exists a field with the given `name`, returns `true`, otherwise `false`\n\nA form is technically allowed to have many fields with the same `name`, so multiple calls to `append` add more same-named fields.\n\nThere's also method `set`, with the same syntax as `append`. The difference is that `.set` removes all fields with the given `name`, and then appends a new field. So it makes sure there's only one field with such `name`, the rest is just like `append`:\n\n- `formData.set(name, value)`,\n- `formData.set(name, blob, fileName)`.\n\nAlso we can iterate over formData fields using `for..of` loop:\n\n```js run\nlet formData = new FormData();\nformData.append('key1', 'value1');\nformData.append('key2', 'value2');\n\n// List key/value pairs\nfor(let [name, value] of formData) {\n  alert(`${name} = ${value}`); // key1=value1, then key2=value2\n}\n```\n\n## Sending a form with a file\n\nThe form is always sent as `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`, this encoding allows to send files. So, `<input type=\"file\">` fields are sent also, similar to a usual form submission.\n\nHere's an example with such form:\n\n```html run autorun\n<form id=\"formElem\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"firstName\" value=\"John\">\n  Picture: <input type=\"file\" name=\"picture\" accept=\"image/*\">\n  <input type=\"submit\">\n</form>\n\n<script>\n  formElem.onsubmit = async (e) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n\n    let response = await fetch('/article/formdata/post/user-avatar', {\n      method: 'POST',\n*!*\n      body: new FormData(formElem)\n*/!*\n    });\n\n    let result = await response.json();\n\n    alert(result.message);\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\n## Sending a form with Blob data\n\nAs we've seen in the chapter <info:fetch>, it's easy to send dynamically generated binary data e.g. an image, as `Blob`. We can supply it directly as `fetch` parameter `body`.\n\nIn practice though, it's often convenient to send an image not separately, but as a part of the form, with additional fields, such as \"name\" and other metadata.\n\nAlso, servers are usually more suited to accept multipart-encoded forms, rather than raw binary data.\n\nThis example submits an image from `<canvas>`, along with some other fields, as a form, using `FormData`:\n\n```html run autorun height=\"90\"\n<body style=\"margin:0\">\n  <canvas id=\"canvasElem\" width=\"100\" height=\"80\" style=\"border:1px solid\"></canvas>\n\n  <input type=\"button\" value=\"Submit\" onclick=\"submit()\">\n\n  <script>\n    canvasElem.onmousemove = function(e) {\n      let ctx = canvasElem.getContext('2d');\n      ctx.lineTo(e.clientX, e.clientY);\n      ctx.stroke();\n    };\n\n    async function submit() {\n      let imageBlob = await new Promise(resolve => canvasElem.toBlob(resolve, 'image/png'));\n\n*!*\n      let formData = new FormData();\n      formData.append(\"firstName\", \"John\");\n      formData.append(\"image\", imageBlob, \"image.png\");\n*/!*    \n\n      let response = await fetch('/article/formdata/post/image-form', {\n        method: 'POST',\n        body: formData\n      });\n      let result = await response.json();\n      alert(result.message);\n    }\n\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\nPlease note how the image `Blob` is added:\n\n```js\nformData.append(\"image\", imageBlob, \"image.png\");\n```\n\nThat's same as if there were `<input type=\"file\" name=\"image\">` in the form, and the visitor submitted a file named `\"image.png\"` (3rd argument) with the data `imageBlob` (2nd argument) from their filesystem.\n\nThe server reads form data and the file, as if it were a regular form submission.\n\n## Summary\n\n[FormData](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-formdata) objects are used to capture HTML form and submit it using `fetch` or another network method.\n\nWe can either create `new FormData(form)` from an HTML form, or create a object without a form at all, and then append fields with methods:\n\n- `formData.append(name, value)`\n- `formData.append(name, blob, fileName)`\n- `formData.set(name, value)`\n- `formData.set(name, blob, fileName)`\n\nLet's note two peculiarities here:\n\n1. The `set` method removes fields with the same name, `append` doesn't. That's the only difference between them.\n2. To send a file, 3-argument syntax is needed, the last argument is a file name, that normally is taken from user filesystem for `<input type=\"file\">`.\n\nOther methods are:\n\n- `formData.delete(name)`\n- `formData.get(name)`\n- `formData.has(name)`\n\nThat's it!",

        "content": "\n\nThe `fetch` method allows to track *download* progress.\n\nPlease note: there's currently no way for `fetch` to track *upload* progress. For that purpose, please use [XMLHttpRequest](info:xmlhttprequest), we'll cover it later.\n\nTo track download progress, we can use `response.body` property. It's `ReadableStream` -- a special object that provides body chunk-by-chunk, as it comes. Readable streams are described in the [Streams API](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#rs-class) specification.\n\nUnlike `response.text()`, `response.json()` and other methods, `response.body` gives full control over the reading process, and we can count how much is consumed at any moment.\n\nHere's the sketch of code that reads the reponse from `response.body`:\n\n```js\n// instead of response.json() and other methods\nconst reader = response.body.getReader();\n\n// infinite loop while the body is downloading\nwhile(true) {\n  // done is true for the last chunk\n  // value is Uint8Array of the chunk bytes\n  const {done, value} = await reader.read();\n\n  if (done) {\n    break;\n  }\n\n  console.log(`Received ${value.length} bytes`)\n}\n```\n\nThe result of `await reader.read()` call is an object with two properties:\n- **`done`** -- `true` when the reading is complete, otherwise `false`.\n- **`value`** -- a typed array of bytes: `Uint8Array`.\n\n```smart\nStreams API also describes asynchronous iteration over `ReadableStream` with `for await..of` loop, but it's not yet widely supported (see [browser issues](https://github.com/whatwg/streams/issues/778#issuecomment-461341033)), so we use `while` loop.\n```\n\nWe receive response chunks in the loop, until the loading finishes, that is: until `done` becomes `true`.\n\nTo log the progress, we just need for every received fragment `value` to add its length to the counter.\n\nHere's the full working example that gets the response and logs the progress in console, more explanations to follow:\n\n```js run async\n// Step 1: start the fetch and obtain a reader\nlet response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/javascript-tutorial/en.javascript.info/commits?per_page=100');\n\nconst reader = response.body.getReader();\n\n// Step 2: get total length\nconst contentLength = +response.headers.get('Content-Length');\n\n// Step 3: read the data\nlet receivedLength = 0; // received that many bytes at the moment\nlet chunks = []; // array of received binary chunks (comprises the body)\nwhile(true) {\n  const {done, value} = await reader.read();\n\n  if (done) {\n    break;\n  }\n\n  chunks.push(value);\n  receivedLength += value.length;\n\n  console.log(`Received ${receivedLength} of ${contentLength}`)\n}\n\n// Step 4: concatenate chunks into single Uint8Array\nlet chunksAll = new Uint8Array(receivedLength); // (4.1)\nlet position = 0;\nfor(let chunk of chunks) {\n\tchunksAll.set(chunk, position); // (4.2)\n\tposition += chunk.length;\n}\n\n// Step 5: decode into a string\nlet result = new TextDecoder(\"utf-8\").decode(chunksAll);\n\n// We're done!\nlet commits = JSON.parse(result);\nalert(commits[0].author.login);\n```\n\nLet's explain that step-by-step:\n\n1. We perform `fetch` as usual, but instead of calling `response.json()`, we obtain a stream reader `response.body.getReader()`.\n\n    Please note, we can't use both these methods to read the same response: either use a reader or a response method to get the result.\n2. Prior to reading, we can figure out the full response length from the `Content-Length` header.\n\n    It may be absent for cross-origin requests (see chapter <info:fetch-crossorigin>) and, well, technically a server doesn't have to set it. But usually it's at place.\n3. Call `await reader.read()` until it's done.\n\n    We gather response chunks in the array `chunks`. That's important, because after the response is consumed, we won't be able to \"re-read\" it using `response.json()` or another way (you can try, there'll be an error).\n4. At the end, we have `chunks` -- an array of `Uint8Array` byte chunks. We need to join them into a single result. Unfortunately, there's no single method that concatenates those, so there's some code to do that:\n    1. We create `chunksAll = new Uint8Array(receivedLength)` -- a same-typed array with the combined length.\n    2. Then use `.set(chunk, position)` method to copy each `chunk` one after another in it.\n5. We have the result in `chunksAll`. It's a byte array though, not a string.\n\n    To create a string, we need to interpret these bytes. The built-in [TextDecoder](info:text-decoder) does exactly that. Then we can `JSON.parse` it, if necessary.\n\n    What if we need binary content instead of a string? That's even simpler. Replace steps 4 and 5 with a single line that creates a `Blob` from all chunks:\n    ```js\n    let blob = new Blob(chunks);\n    ```\n\nAt the end we have the result (as a string or a blob, whatever is convenient), and progress-tracking in the process.\n\nOnce again, please note, that's not for *upload* progress (no way now with `fetch`), only for *download* progress.",

So how can we abort a `fetch`?\n\nThere's a special built-in object for such purposes: `AbortController`, that can be used to abort not only `fetch`, but other asynchronous tasks as well.\n\nThe usage is pretty simple:\n\n- Step 1: create a controller:\n\n    ```js\n    let controller = new AbortController();\n    ```\n\n    A controller is an extremely simple object.\n\n    - It has a single method `abort()`, and a single property `signal`.\n    - When `abort()` is called:\n        - `abort` event triggers on `controller.signal`\n        - `controller.signal.aborted` property becomes `true`.\n\n    All parties interested to learn about `abort()` call set listeners on `controller.signal` to track it.\n\n    Like this (without `fetch` yet):\n\n    ```js run\n    let controller = new AbortController();\n    let signal = controller.signal;\n\n    // triggers when controller.abort() is called\n    signal.addEventListener('abort', () => alert(\"abort!\"));\n\n    controller.abort(); // abort!\n\n    alert(signal.aborted); // true\n    ```\n\n- Step 2: pass the `signal` property to `fetch` option:\n\n    ```js\n    let controller = new AbortController();\n    fetch(url, {\n      signal: controller.signal\n    });\n    ```\n\n    The `fetch` method knows how to work with `AbortController`, it listens to `abort` on `signal`.\n\n- Step 3: to abort, call `controller.abort()`:\n\n    ```js\n    controller.abort();\n    ```\n\n    We're done: `fetch` gets the event from `signal` and aborts the request.\n\nWhen a fetch is aborted, its promise rejects with an error `AbortError`, so we should handle it, e.g. in `try..catch`:\n\n```js run async\n// abort in 1 second\nlet controller = new AbortController();\nsetTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 1000);\n\ntry {\n  let response = await fetch('/article/fetch-abort/demo/hang', {\n    signal: controller.signal\n  });\n} catch(err) {\n  if (err.name == 'AbortError') { // handle abort()\n    alert(\"Aborted!\");\n  } else {\n    throw err;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**`AbortController` is scalable, it allows to cancel multiple fetches at once.**\n\nFor instance, here we fetch many `urls` in parallel, and the controller aborts them all:\n\n```js\nlet urls = [...]; // a list of urls to fetch in parallel\n\nlet controller = new AbortController();\n\nlet fetchJobs = urls.map(url => fetch(url, {\n  signal: controller.signal\n}));\n\nlet results = await Promise.all(fetchJobs);\n\n// if controller.abort() is called from elsewhere,\n// it aborts all fetches\n```\n\nIf we have our own asynchronous jobs, different from `fetch`, we can use a single `AbortController` to stop those, together with fetches.\n\nWe just need to listen to its `abort` event:\n\n```js\nlet urls = [...];\nlet controller = new AbortController();\n\nlet ourJob = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { // our task\n  ...\n  controller.signal.addEventListener('abort', reject);\n});\n\nlet fetchJobs = urls.map(url => fetch(url, { // fetches\n  signal: controller.signal\n}));\n\n// Wait for fetches and our task in parallel\nlet results = await Promise.all([...fetchJobs, ourJob]);\n\n// if controller.abort() is called from elsewhere,\n// it aborts all fetches and ourJob\n```\n\nSo `AbortController` is not only for `fetch`, it's a universal object to abort asynchronous tasks, and `fetch` has built-in integration with it.",

A brief history\n\nCORS exists to protect the internet from evil hackers.\n\nSeriously. Let's make a very brief historical digression.\n\n**For many years a script from one site could not access the content of another site.**\n\nThat simple, yet powerful rule was a foundation of the internet security. E.g. an evil script from website `hacker.com` could not access user's mailbox at website `gmail.com`. People felt safe.\n\nJavaScript also did not have any special methods to perform network requests at that time. It was a toy language to decorate a web page.\n\nBut web developers demanded more power. A variety of tricks were invented to work around the limitation and make requests to other websites.\n\n### Using forms\n\nOne way to communicate with another server was to submit a `<form>` there. People submitted it into `<iframe>`, just to stay on the current page, like this:\n\n```html\n<!-- form target -->\n*!*\n<iframe name=\"iframe\"></iframe>\n*/!*\n\n<!-- a form could be dynamically generated and submited by JavaScript -->\n*!*\n<form target=\"iframe\" method=\"POST\" action=\"http://another.com/…\">\n*/!*\n  ...\n</form>\n```\n\nSo, it was possible to make a GET/POST request to another site, even without networking methods, as forms can send data anywhere. But as it's forbidden to access the content of an `<iframe>` from another site, it wasn't possible to read the response.\n\nTo be precise, there were actually tricks for that, they required special scripts at both the iframe and the page. So the communication with the iframe was technically possible. Right now there's no point to go into details, let these dinosaurs rest in peace.\n\n### Using scripts\n\nAnother trick was to use a `script` tag. A script could have any `src`, with any domain, like `<script src=\"http://another.com/…\">`. It's possible to execute a script from any website.\n\nIf a website, e.g. `another.com` intended to expose data for this kind of access, then a so-called \"JSONP (JSON with padding)\" protocol was used.\n\nHere's how it worked.\n\nLet's say we, at our site, need to get the data from `http://another.com`, such as the weather:\n\n1. First, in advance, we declare a global function to accept the data, e.g. `gotWeather`.\n\n    ```js\n    // 1. Declare the function to process the weather data\n    function gotWeather({ temperature, humidity }) {\n      alert(`temperature: ${temperature}, humidity: ${humidity}`);\n    }\n    ```\n2. Then we make a `<script>` tag with `src=\"http://another.com/weather.json?callback=gotWeather\"`, using the name of our function as the `callback` URL-parameter.\n\n    ```js\n    let script = document.createElement('script');\n    script.src = `http://another.com/weather.json?callback=gotWeather`;\n    document.body.append(script);\n    ```\n3. The remote server `another.com` dynamically generates a script that calls `gotWeather(...)` with the data it wants us to receive.\n    ```js\n    // The expected answer from the server looks like this:\n    gotWeather({\n      temperature: 25,\n      humidity: 78\n    });\n    ```\n4. When the remote script loads and executes, `gotWeather` runs, and, as it's our function, we have the data.\n\nThat works, and doesn't violate security, because both sides agreed to pass the data this way. And, when both sides agree, it's definitely not a hack. There are still services that provide such access, as it works even for very old browsers.\n\nAfter a while, networking methods appeared in browser JavaScript.\n\nAt first, cross-origin requests were forbidden. But as a result of long discussions, cross-origin requests were allowed, but with any new capabilities requiring an explicit allowance by the server, expressed in special headers.\n\n## Simple requests\n\nThere are two types of cross-origin requests:\n\n1. Simple requests.\n2. All the others.\n\nSimple Requests are, well, simpler to make, so let's start with them.\n\nA [simple request](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#terminology) is a request that satisfies two conditions:\n\n1. [Simple method](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#simple-method): GET, POST or HEAD\n2. [Simple headers](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#simple-header) -- the only allowed custom headers are:\n    - `Accept`,\n    - `Accept-Language`,\n    - `Content-Language`,\n    - `Content-Type` with the value `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data` or `text/plain`.\n\nAny other request is considered \"non-simple\". For instance, a request with `PUT` method or with an `API-Key` HTTP-header does not fit the limitations.\n\n**The essential difference is that a \"simple request\" can be made with a `<form>` or a `<script>`, without any special methods.**\n\nSo, even a very old server should be ready to accept a simple request.\n\nContrary to that, requests with non-standard headers or e.g. method `DELETE` can't be created this way. For a long time JavaScript was unable to do such requests. So an old server may assume that such requests come from a privileged source, \"because a webpage is unable to send them\".\n\nWhen we try to make a non-simple request, the browser sends a special \"preflight\" request that asks the server -- does it agree to accept such cross-origin requests, or not?\n\nAnd, unless the server explicitly confirms that with headers, a non-simple request is not sent.\n\nNow we'll go into details.\n\n## CORS for simple requests\n\nIf a request is cross-origin, the browser always adds `Origin` header to it.\n\nFor instance, if we request `https://anywhere.com/request` from `https://javascript.info/page`, the headers will be like:\n\n```http\nGET /request\nHost: anywhere.com\n*!*\nOrigin: https://javascript.info\n*/!*\n...\n```\n\nAs you can see, `Origin` header contains exactly the origin (domain/protocol/port), without a path.\n\nThe server can inspect the `Origin` and, if it agrees to accept such a request, adds a special header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the response. That header should contain the allowed origin (in our case `https://javascript.info`), or a star `*`. Then the response is successful, otherwise an error.\n\nThe browser plays the role of a trusted mediator here:\n1. It ensures that the correct `Origin` is sent with a cross-origin request.\n2. It checks for permitting `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in the response, if it exists, then JavaScript is allowed to access the response, otherwise it fails with an error.\n\n![](xhr-another-domain.svg)\n\nHere's an example of a permissive server response:\n```http\n200 OK\nContent-Type:text/html; charset=UTF-8\n*!*\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info\n*/!*\n```\n\n## Response headers\n\nFor cross-origin request, by default JavaScript may only access so-called \"simple\" response headers:\n\n- `Cache-Control`\n- `Content-Language`\n- `Content-Type`\n- `Expires`\n- `Last-Modified`\n- `Pragma`\n\nAccessing any other response header causes an error.\n\n```smart\nThere's no `Content-Length` header in the list!\n\nThis header contains the full response length. So, if we're downloading something and would like to track the percentage of progress, then an additional permission is required to access that header (see below).\n```\n\nTo grant JavaScript access to any other response header, the server must send  `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header. It contains a comma-separated list of non-simple header names that should be made accessible.\n\nFor example:\n\n```http\n200 OK\nContent-Type:text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 12345\nAPI-Key: 2c9de507f2c54aa1\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info\n*!*\nAccess-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Length,API-Key\n*/!*\n```\n\nWith such `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header, the script is allowed to read `Content-Length` and `API-Key` headers of the response.\n\n## \"Non-simple\" requests\n\nWe can use any HTTP-method: not just `GET/POST`, but also `PATCH`, `DELETE` and others.\n\nSome time ago no one could even imagine that a webpage could make such requests. So there may still exist webservices that treat a non-standard method as a signal: \"That's not a browser\". They can take it into account when checking access rights.\n\nSo, to avoid misunderstandings, any \"non-simple\" request -- that couldn't be done in the old times, the browser does not make such requests right away. Before it sends a preliminary, so-called \"preflight\" request, asking for permission.\n\nA preflight request uses method `OPTIONS`, no body and two headers:\n\n- `Access-Control-Request-Method` header has the method of the non-simple request.\n- `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header provides a comma-separated list of its non-simple HTTP-headers.\n\nIf the server agrees to serve the requests, then it should respond with empty body, status 200 and headers:\n\n- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` must have the allowed method.\n- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` must have a list of allowed headers.\n- Additionally, the header `Access-Control-Max-Age` may specify a number of seconds to cache the permissions. So the browser won't have to send a preflight for subsequent requests that satisfy given permissions.\n\n![](xhr-preflight.svg)\n\nLet's see how it works step-by-step on example, for a cross-origin `PATCH` request (this method is often used to update data):\n\n```js\nlet response = await fetch('https://site.com/service.json', {\n  method: 'PATCH',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n    'API-Key': 'secret'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThere are three reasons why the request is not simple (one is enough):\n- Method `PATCH`\n- `Content-Type` is not one of: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, `text/plain`.\n- \"Non-simple\" `API-Key` header.\n\n### Step 1 (preflight request)\n\nPrior to sending such request, the browser, on its own, sends a preflight request that looks like this:\n\n```http\nOPTIONS /service.json\nHost: site.com\nOrigin: https://javascript.info\nAccess-Control-Request-Method: PATCH\nAccess-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type,API-Key\n```\n\n- Method: `OPTIONS`.\n- The path -- exactly the same as the main request: `/service.json`.\n- Cross-origin special headers:\n    - `Origin` -- the source origin.\n    - `Access-Control-Request-Method` -- requested method.\n    - `Access-Control-Request-Headers` -- a comma-separated list of \"non-simple\" headers.\n\n### Step 2 (preflight response)\n\nThe server should respond with status 200 and headers:\n- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: PATCH`\n- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,API-Key`.\n\nThat allows future communication, otherwise an error is triggered.\n\nIf the server expects other methods and headers in the future, it makes sense to allow them in advance by adding to the list:\n\n```http\n200 OK\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: PUT,PATCH,DELETE\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: API-Key,Content-Type,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control\nAccess-Control-Max-Age: 86400\n```\n\nNow the browser can see that `PATCH` is in `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` and `Content-Type,API-Key` are in the list `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, so it sends out the main request.\n\nBesides, the preflight response is cached for time, specified by `Access-Control-Max-Age` header (86400 seconds, one day), so subsequent requests will not cause a preflight. Assuming that they fit the cached allowances, they will be sent directly.\n\n### Step 3 (actual request)\n\nWhen the preflight is successful, the browser now makes the main request. The algorithm here is the same as for simple requests.\n\nThe main request has `Origin` header (because it's cross-origin):\n\n```http\nPATCH /service.json\nHost: site.com\nContent-Type: application/json\nAPI-Key: secret\nOrigin: https://javascript.info\n```\n\n### Step 4 (actual response)\n\nThe server should not forget to add `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the main response. A successful preflight does not relieve from that:\n\n```http\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info\n```\n\nThen JavaScript is able to read the main server response.\n\n```smart\nPreflight request occurs \"behind the scenes\", it's invisible to JavaScript.\n\nJavaScript only gets the response to the main request or an error if there's no server permission.\n```\n\n## Credentials\n\nA cross-origin request initiated by JavaScript code by default does not bring any credentials (cookies or HTTP authentication).\n\nThat's uncommon for HTTP-requests. Usually, a request to `http://site.com` is accompanied by all cookies from that domain. But cross-origin requests made by JavaScript methods are an exception.\n\nFor example, `fetch('http://another.com')` does not send any cookies, even those  (!) that belong to `another.com` domain.\n\nWhy?\n\nThat's because a request with credentials is much more powerful than without them. If allowed, it grants JavaScript the full power to act on behalf of the user and access sensitive information using their credentials.\n\nDoes the server really trust the script that much? Then it must explicitly allow requests with credentials with an additional header.\n\nTo send credentials in `fetch`, we need to add the option `credentials: \"include\"`, like this:\n\n```js\nfetch('http://another.com', {\n  credentials: \"include\"\n});\n```\n\nNow `fetch` sends cookies originating from `another.com` without request to that site.\n\nIf the server agrees to accept the request *with credentials*, it should add a header `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` to the response, in addition to `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```http\n200 OK\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\n```\n\nPlease note: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is prohibited from using a star `*` for requests with credentials. Like shown above, it must provide the exact origin there. That's an additional safety measure, to ensure that the server really knows who it trusts to make such requests.\n\n## Summary\n\nFrom the browser point of view, there are two kinds of cross-origin requests: \"simple\" and all the others.\n\n[Simple requests](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#terminology) must satisfy the following conditions:\n- Method: GET, POST or HEAD.\n- Headers -- we can set only:\n    - `Accept`\n    - `Accept-Language`\n    - `Content-Language`\n    - `Content-Type` to the value `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data` or `text/plain`.\n\nThe essential difference is that simple requests were doable since ancient times using `<form>` or `<script>` tags, while non-simple were impossible for browsers for a long time.\n\nSo, the practical difference is that simple requests are sent right away, with `Origin` header, while for the other ones the browser makes a preliminary \"preflight\" request, asking for permission.\n\n**For simple requests:**\n\n- → The browser sends `Origin` header with the origin.\n- ← For requests without credentials (not sent default), the server should set:\n    - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to `*` or same value as `Origin`\n- ← For requests with credentials, the server should set:\n    - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to same value as `Origin`\n    - `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` to `true`\n\nAdditionally, to grant JavaScript access to any response headers except `Cache-Control`,  `Content-Language`, `Content-Type`, `Expires`, `Last-Modified` or `Pragma`, the server should list the allowed ones in `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header.\n\n**For non-simple requests, a preliminary \"preflight\" request is issued before the requested one:**\n\n- → The browser sends `OPTIONS` request to the same URL, with headers:\n    - `Access-Control-Request-Method` has requested method.\n    - `Access-Control-Request-Headers` lists non-simple requested headers.\n- ← The server should respond with status 200 and headers:\n    - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` with a list of allowed methods,\n    - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` with a list of allowed headers,\n    - `Access-Control-Max-Age` with a number of seconds to cache permissions.\n- Then the actual request is sent, the previous \"simple\" scheme is applied.",

Request to the same origin.\n2. Request to another origin.\n3. Request from HTTPS to HTTP (from safe to unsafe protocol).\n\nUnlike `referrer` option that allows to set the exact `Referer` value, `referrerPolicy` tells the browser general rules for each request type.\n\nPossible values are described in the [Referrer Policy specification](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-referrer-policy/):\n\n- **`\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\"`** -- the default value: full `Referer` is sent always, unless we send a request from HTTPS to HTTP (to less secure protocol).\n- **`\"no-referrer\"`** -- never send `Referer`.\n- **`\"origin\"`** -- only send the origin in `Referer`, not the full page URL, e.g. only `http://site.com` instead of `http://site.com/path`.\n- **`\"origin-when-cross-origin\"`** -- send full `Referer` to the same origin, but only the origin part for cross-origin requests (as above).\n- **`\"same-origin\"`** -- send full `Referer` to the same origin, but no `Referer` for cross-origin requests.\n- **`\"strict-origin\"`** -- send only origin, don't send `Referer` for HTTPS→HTTP requests.\n- **`\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\"`** -- for same-origin send full `Referer`, for cross-origin send only origin, unless it's HTTPS→HTTP request, then send nothing.\n- **`\"unsafe-url\"`** -- always send full url in `Referer`, even for HTTPS→HTTP requests.\n\nHere's a table with all combinations:\n\n| Value | To same origin | To another origin | HTTPS→HTTP |\n|-------|----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| `\"no-referrer\"` | - | - | - |\n| `\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\"` or `\"\"` (default) | full | full | - |\n| `\"origin\"` | origin | origin | origin |\n| `\"origin-when-cross-origin\"` | full | origin | origin |\n| `\"same-origin\"` | full | - | - |\n| `\"strict-origin\"` | origin | origin | - |\n| `\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\"` | full | origin | - |\n| `\"unsafe-url\"` | full | full | full |\n\nLet's say we have an admin zone with URL structure that shouldn't be known from outside of the site.\n\nIf we send a `fetch`, then by default it always sends the `Referer` header with the full url of our page (except when we request from HTTPS to HTTP, then no `Referer`).\n\nE.g. `Referer: https://javascript.info/admin/secret/paths`.\n\nIf we'd like other websites know only the origin part, not URL-path, we can set the option:\n\n```js\nfetch('https://another.com/page', {\n  // ...\n  referrerPolicy: \"origin-when-cross-origin\" // Referer: https://javascript.info\n});\n```\n\nWe can put it to all `fetch` calls, maybe integrate into JavaScript library of our project that does all requests and uses `fetch` inside.\n\nIts only difference compared to the default behavior is that for requests to another origin `fetch` sends only the origin part of the URL (e.g. `https://javascript.info`, without path). For requests to our origin we still get the full `Referer` (maybe useful for debugging purposes).\n\n```smart header=\"Referrer policy is not only for `fetch`\"\nReferrer policy, described in the [specification](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-referrer-policy/), is not just for `fetch`, but more global.\n\nIn particular, it's possible to set the default policy for the whole page using `Referrer-Policy` HTTP header, or per-link, with `<a rel=\"noreferrer\">`.\n```\n\n## mode\n\nThe `mode` option is a safe-guard that prevents occasional cross-origin requests:\n\n- **`\"cors\"`** -- the default, cross-origin requests are allowed, as described in <info:fetch-crossorigin>,\n- **`\"same-origin\"`** -- cross-origin requests are forbidden,\n- **`\"no-cors\"`** -- only simple cross-origin requests are allowed.\n\nThis option may be useful when the URL for `fetch` comes from a 3rd-party, and we want a \"power off switch\" to limit cross-origin capabilities.\n\n## credentials\n\nThe `credentials` option specifies whether `fetch` should send cookies and HTTP-Authorization headers with the request.\n\n- **`\"same-origin\"`** -- the default, don't send for cross-origin requests,\n- **`\"include\"`** -- always send, requires `Accept-Control-Allow-Credentials` from cross-origin server in order for JavaScript to access the response, that was covered in the chapter <info:fetch-crossorigin>,\n- **`\"omit\"`** -- never send, even for same-origin requests.\n\n## cache\n\nBy default, `fetch` requests make use of standard HTTP-caching. That is, it honors `Expires`, `Cache-Control` headers, sends `If-Modified-Since`, and so on. Just like regular HTTP-requests do.\n\nThe `cache` options allows to ignore HTTP-cache or fine-tune its usage:\n\n- **`\"default\"`** -- `fetch` uses standard HTTP-cache rules and headers,\n- **`\"no-store\"`** -- totally ignore HTTP-cache, this mode becomes the default if we set a header `If-Modified-Since`, `If-None-Match`, `If-Unmodified-Since`, `If-Match`, or `If-Range`,\n- **`\"reload\"`** -- don't take the result from HTTP-cache (if any), but populate cache with the response (if response headers allow),\n- **`\"no-cache\"`** -- create a conditional request if there is a cached response, and a normal request otherwise. Populate HTTP-cache with the response,\n- **`\"force-cache\"`** -- use a response from HTTP-cache, even if it's stale. If there's no response in HTTP-cache, make a regular HTTP-request, behave normally,\n- **`\"only-if-cached\"`** -- use a response from HTTP-cache, even if it's stale. If there's no response in HTTP-cache, then error. Only works when `mode` is `\"same-origin\"`.\n\n## redirect\n\nNormally, `fetch` transparently follows HTTP-redirects, like 301, 302 etc.\n\nThe `redirect` option allows to change that:\n\n- **`\"follow\"`** -- the default, follow HTTP-redirects,\n- **`\"error\"`** -- error in case of HTTP-redirect,\n- **`\"manual\"`** -- don't follow HTTP-redirect, but `response.url` will be the new URL, and `response.redirected` will be `true`, so that we can perform the redirect manually to the new URL (if needed).\n\n## integrity\n\nThe `integrity` option allows to check if the response matches the known-ahead checksum.\n\nAs described in the [specification](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-subresource-integrity/), supported hash-functions are SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512, there might be others depending on a browser.\n\nFor example, we're downloading a file, and we know that it's SHA-256 checksum is \"abcdef\" (a real checksum is longer, of course).\n\nWe can put it in the `integrity` option, like this:\n\n```js\nfetch('http://site.com/file', {\n  integrity: 'sha256-abcdef'\n});\n```\n\nThen `fetch` will calculate SHA-256 on its own and compare it with our string. In case of a mismatch, an error is triggered.\n\n## keepalive\n\nThe `keepalive` option indicates that the request may \"outlive\" the webpage that initiated it.\n\nFor example, we gather statistics about how the current visitor uses our page (mouse clicks, page fragments he views), to analyze and improve user experience.\n\nWhen the visitor leaves our page -- we'd like to save the data at our server.\n\nWe can use `window.onunload` event for that:\n\n```js run\nwindow.onunload = function() {\n  fetch('/analytics', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    body: \"statistics\",\n*!*\n    keepalive: true\n*/!*\n  });\n};\n```\n\nNormally, when a document is unloaded, all associated network requests are aborted. But `keepalive` option tells the browser to perform the request in background, even after it leaves the page. So this option is essential for our request to succeed.\n\nIt has few limitations:\n\n- We can't send megabytes: the body limit for `keepalive` requests is 64kb.\n    - If gather more data, we can send it out regularly in packets, so that there won't be a lot left for the last `onunload` request.\n    - The limit is for all currently ongoing requests. So we can't cheat it by creating 100 requests, each 64kb.\n- We can't handle the server response if the request is made in `onunload`, because the document is already unloaded at that time, functions won't work.\n    - Usually, the server sends empty response to such requests, so it's not a problem.",

        "content": "\n\nThe built-in [URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#api) class provides a convenient interface for creating and parsing URLs.\n\nThere are no networking methods that require exactly a `URL` object, strings are good enough. So technically we don't have to use `URL`. But sometimes it can be really helpful.\n\n## Creating a URL\n\nThe syntax to create a new `URL` object:\n\n```js\nnew URL(url, [base])\n```\n\n- **`url`** -- the full URL or only path (if base is set, see below),\n- **`base`** -- an optional base URL: if set and `url` argument has only path, then the URL is generated relative to `base`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nlet url = new URL('https://javascript.info/profile/admin');\n```\n\nThese two URLs are same:\n\n```js run\nlet url1 = new URL('https://javascript.info/profile/admin');\nlet url2 = new URL('/profile/admin', 'https://javascript.info');\n\nalert(url1); // https://javascript.info/profile/admin\nalert(url2); // https://javascript.info/profile/admin\n```\n\nWe can easily create a new URL based on the path relative to an existing URL:\n\n```js run\nlet url = new URL('https://javascript.info/profile/admin');\nlet newUrl = new URL('tester', url);\n\nalert(newUrl); // https://javascript.info/profile/tester\n```\n\nThe `URL` object immediately allows us to access its components, so it's a nice way to parse the url, e.g.:\n\n```js run\nlet url = new URL('https://javascript.info/url');\n\nalert(url.protocol); // https:\nalert(url.host);     // javascript.info\nalert(url.pathname); // /url\n```\n\nHere's the cheatsheet for URL components:\n\n![](url-object.svg)\n\n- `href` is the full url, same as `url.toString()`\n- `protocol` ends with the colon character `:`\n- `search` - a string of parameters, starts with the question mark `?`\n- `hash` starts with the hash character `#`\n- there may be also `user` and `password` properties if HTTP authentication is present: `http://login:password@site.com` (not painted above, rarely used).\n\n\n```smart header=\"We can pass `URL` objects to networking (and most other) methods instead of a string\"\nWe can use a `URL` object in `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`, almost everywhere where a URL-string is expected.\n\nGenerally, `URL` object can be passed to any method instead of a string, as most method will perform the string conversion, that turns a `URL` object into a string with full URL.\n```\n\n## SearchParams \"?...\"\n\nLet's say we want to create a url with given search params, for instance, `https://google.com/search?query=JavaScript`.\n\nWe can provide them in the URL string:\n\n```js\nnew URL('https://google.com/search?query=JavaScript')\n```\n\n...But parameters need to be encoded if they contain spaces, non-latin letters, etc (more about that below).\n\nSo there's URL property for that: `url.searchParams`, an object of type [URLSearchParams](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#urlsearchparams).\n\nIt provides convenient methods for search parameters:\n\n- **`append(name, value)`** -- add the parameter by `name`,\n- **`delete(name)`** -- remove the parameter by `name`,\n- **`get(name)`** -- get the parameter by `name`,\n- **`getAll(name)`** -- get all parameters with the same `name` (that's possible, e.g. `?user=John&user=Pete`),\n- **`has(name)`** -- check for the existance of the parameter by `name`,\n- **`set(name, value)`** -- set/replace the parameter,\n- **`sort()`** -- sort parameters by name, rarely needed,\n- ...and it's also iterable, similar to `Map`.\n\nAn example with parameters that contain spaces and punctuation marks:\n\n```js run\nlet url = new URL('https://google.com/search');\n\nurl.searchParams.set('q', 'test me!'); // added parameter with a space and !\n\nalert(url); // https://google.com/search?q=test+me%21\n\nurl.searchParams.set('tbs', 'qdr:y'); // added parameter with a colon :\n\n// parameters are automatically encoded\nalert(url); // https://google.com/search?q=test+me%21&tbs=qdr%3Ay\n\n// iterate over search parameters (decoded)\nfor(let [name, value] of url.searchParams) {\n  alert(`${name}=${value}`); // q=test me!, then tbs=qdr:y\n}\n```\n\n\n## Encoding\n\nThere's a standard [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986) that defines which characters are allowed in URLs and which are not.\n\nThose that are not allowed, must be encoded, for instance non-latin letters and spaces - replaced with their UTF-8 codes, prefixed by `%`, such as `%20` (a space can be encoded by `+`, for historical reasons, but that's an exception).\n\nThe good news is that `URL` objects handle all that automatically. We just supply all parameters unencoded, and then convert the `URL` to string:\n\n```js run\n// using some cyrillic characters for this example\n\nlet url = new URL('https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Тест');\n\nurl.searchParams.set('key', 'ъ');\nalert(url); //https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82?key=%D1%8A\n```\n\nAs you can see, both `Тест` in the url path and `ъ` in the parameter are encoded.\n\nThe URL became longer, because each cyrillic letter is represented with two bytes in UTF-8, so there are two `%..` entities.\n\n### Encoding strings\n\nIn old times, before `URL` objects appeared, people used strings for URLs.\n\nAs of now, `URL` objects are often more convenient, but strings can still be used as well. In many cases using a string makes the code shorter.\n\nIf we use a string though, we need to encode/decode special characters manually.\n\nThere are built-in functions for that:\n\n- [encodeURI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURI) - encodes URL as a whole.\n- [decodeURI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURI) - decodes it back.\n- [encodeURIComponent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent) - encodes a URL component, such as a search parameter, or a hash, or a pathname.\n- [decodeURIComponent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURIComponent) - decodes it back.\n\nA natural question is: \"What's the difference between `encodeURIComponent` and `encodeURI`? When we should use either?\"\n\nThat's easy to understand if we look at the URL, that's split into components in the picture above:\n\n```\nhttps://site.com:8080/path/page?p1=v1&p2=v2#hash\n```\n\nAs we can see, characters such as `:`, `?`, `=`, `&`, `#` are allowed in URL.\n\n...On the other hand, if we look at a single URL component, such as a search parameter, these characters must be encoded, not to break the formatting.\n\n- `encodeURI` encodes only characters that are totally forbidden in URL.\n- `encodeURIComponent` encodes same characters, and, in addition to them, characters `#`, `$`, `&`, `+`, `,`, `/`, `:`, `;`, `=`, `?` and `@`.\n\nSo, for a whole URL we can use `encodeURI`:\n\n```js run\n// using cyrillic characters in url path\nlet url = encodeURI('http://site.com/привет');\n\nalert(url); // http://site.com/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82\n```\n\n...While for URL parameters we should use `encodeURIComponent` instead:\n\n```js run\nlet music = encodeURIComponent('Rock&Roll');\n\nlet url = `https://google.com/search?q=${music}`;\nalert(url); // https://google.com/search?q=Rock%26Roll\n```\n\nCompare it with `encodeURI`:\n\n```js run\nlet music = encodeURI('Rock&Roll');\n\nlet url = `https://google.com/search?q=${music}`;\nalert(url); // https://google.com/search?q=Rock&Roll\n```\n\nAs we can see, `encodeURI` does not encode `&`, as this is a legit character in URL as a whole.\n\nBut we should encode `&` inside a search parameter, otherwise, we get `q=Rock&Roll` - that is actually `q=Rock` plus some obscure parameter `Roll`. Not as intended.\n\nSo we should use only `encodeURIComponent` for each search parameter, to correctly insert it in the URL string. The safest is to encode both name and value, unless we're absolutely sure that it has only allowed characters.\n\n````smart header=\"Encoding difference compared to `URL`\"\nClasses [URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-class) and [URLSearchParams](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-urlsearchparams) are based on the latest URI specification: [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986), while `encode*` functions are based on the obsolete version [RFC2396](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt).\n\nThere are few differences, e.g. IPv6 addresses are encoded differently:\n\n```js run\n// valid url with IPv6 address\nlet url = 'http://[2607:f8b0:4005:802::1007]/';\n\nalert(encodeURI(url)); // http://%5B2607:f8b0:4005:802::1007%5D/\nalert(new URL(url)); // http://[2607:f8b0:4005:802::1007]/\n```\n\nAs we can see, `encodeURI` replaced square brackets `[...]`, that's not correct, the reason is: IPv6 urls did not exist at the time of RFC2396 (August 1998).\n\nSuch cases are rare, `encode*` functions work well most of the time.\n````",

        "content": "\n\n`XMLHttpRequest` is a built-in browser object that allows to make HTTP requests in JavaScript.\n\nDespite of having the word \"XML\" in its name, it can operate on any data, not only in XML format. We can upload/download files, track progress and much more.\n\nRight now, there's another, more modern method `fetch`, that somewhat deprecates `XMLHttpRequest`.\n\nIn modern web-development `XMLHttpRequest` is used for three reasons:\n\n1. Historical reasons: we need to support existing scripts with `XMLHttpRequest`.\n2. We need to support old browsers, and don't want polyfills (e.g. to keep scripts tiny).\n3. We need something that `fetch` can't do yet, e.g. to track upload progress.\n\nDoes that sound familiar? If yes, then all right, go on with `XMLHttpRequest`. Otherwise, please head on to <info:fetch>.\n\n## The basics\n\nXMLHttpRequest has two modes of operation: synchronous and asynchronous.\n\nLet's see the asynchronous first, as it's used in the majority of cases.\n\nTo do the request, we need 3 steps:\n\n1. Create `XMLHttpRequest`:\n    ```js\n    let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    ```\n    The constructor has no arguments.\n\n2. Initialize it, usually right after `new XMLHttpRequest`:\n    ```js\n    xhr.open(method, URL, [async, user, password])\n    ```\n\n    This method specifies the main parameters of the request:\n\n    - `method` -- HTTP-method. Usually `\"GET\"` or `\"POST\"`.\n    - `URL` -- the URL to request, a string, can be [URL](info:url) object.\n    - `async` -- if explicitly set to `false`, then the request is synchronous, we'll cover that a bit later.\n    - `user`, `password` -- login and password for basic HTTP auth (if required).\n\n    Please note that `open` call, contrary to its name, does not open the connection. It only configures the request, but the network activity only starts with the call of `send`.\n\n3. Send it out.\n\n    ```js\n    xhr.send([body])\n    ```\n\n    This method opens the connection and sends the request to server. The optional `body` parameter contains the request body.\n\n    Some request methods like `GET` do not have a body. And some of them like `POST` use `body` to send the data to the server. We'll see examples of that later.\n\n4. Listen to `xhr` events for response.\n\n    These three events are the most widely used:\n    - `load` -- when the request is complete (even if HTTP status is like 400 or 500), and the response is fully downloaded.\n    - `error` -- when the request couldn't be made, e.g. network down or invalid URL.\n    - `progress` -- triggers periodically while the response is being downloaded, reports how much has been downloaded.\n\n    ```js\n    xhr.onload = function() {\n      alert(`Loaded: ${xhr.status} ${xhr.response}`);\n    };\n\n    xhr.onerror = function() { // only triggers if the request couldn't be made at all\n      alert(`Network Error`);\n    };\n\n    xhr.onprogress = function(event) { // triggers periodically\n      // event.loaded - how many bytes downloaded\n      // event.lengthComputable = true if the server sent Content-Length header\n      // event.total - total number of bytes (if lengthComputable)\n      alert(`Received ${event.loaded} of ${event.total}`);\n    };\n    ```\n\nHere's a full example. The code below loads the URL at `/article/xmlhttprequest/example/load` from the server and prints the progress:\n\n```js run\n// 1. Create a new XMLHttpRequest object\nlet xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n// 2. Configure it: GET-request for the URL /article/.../load\nxhr.open('GET', '/article/xmlhttprequest/example/load');\n\n// 3. Send the request over the network\nxhr.send();\n\n// 4. This will be called after the response is received\nxhr.onload = function() {\n  if (xhr.status != 200) { // analyze HTTP status of the response\n    alert(`Error ${xhr.status}: ${xhr.statusText}`); // e.g. 404: Not Found\n  } else { // show the result\n    alert(`Done, got ${xhr.response.length} bytes`); // response is the server\n  }\n};\n\nxhr.onprogress = function(event) {\n  if (event.lengthComputable) {\n    alert(`Received ${event.loaded} of ${event.total} bytes`);\n  } else {\n    alert(`Received ${event.loaded} bytes`); // no Content-Length\n  }\n\n};\n\nxhr.onerror = function() {\n  alert(\"Request failed\");\n};\n```\n\nOnce the server has responded, we can receive the result in the following `xhr` properties:\n\n`status`\n: HTTP status code (a number): `200`, `404`, `403` and so on, can be `0` in case of a non-HTTP failure.\n\n`statusText`\n: HTTP status message (a string): usually `OK` for `200`, `Not Found` for `404`, `Forbidden` for `403` and so on.\n\n`response` (old scripts may use `responseText`)\n: The server response body.\n\nWe can also specify a timeout using the corresponding property:\n\n```js\nxhr.timeout = 10000; // timeout in ms, 10 seconds\n```\n\nIf the request does not succeed within the given time, it gets canceled and `timeout` event triggers.\n\n````smart header=\"URL search parameters\"\nTo add parameters to URL, like `?name=value`, and ensure the proper encoding, we can use [URL](info:url) object:\n\n```js\nlet url = new URL('https://google.com/search');\nurl.searchParams.set('q', 'test me!');\n\n// the parameter 'q' is encoded\nxhr.open('GET', url); // https://google.com/search?q=test+me%21\n```\n\n````\n\n## Response Type\n\nWe can use `xhr.responseType` property to set the response format:\n\n- `\"\"` (default) -- get as string,\n- `\"text\"` -- get as string,\n- `\"arraybuffer\"` -- get as `ArrayBuffer` (for binary data, see chapter <info:arraybuffer-binary-arrays>),\n- `\"blob\"` -- get as `Blob` (for binary data, see chapter <info:blob>),\n- `\"document\"` -- get as XML document (can use XPath and other XML methods),\n- `\"json\"` -- get as JSON (parsed automatically).\n\nFor example, let's get the response as JSON:\n\n```js run\nlet xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\nxhr.open('GET', '/article/xmlhttprequest/example/json');\n\n*!*\nxhr.responseType = 'json';\n*/!*\n\nxhr.send();\n\n// the response is {\"message\": \"Hello, world!\"}\nxhr.onload = function() {\n  let responseObj = xhr.response;\n  alert(responseObj.message); // Hello, world!\n};\n```\n\n```smart\nIn the old scripts you may also find `xhr.responseText` and even `xhr.responseXML` properties.\n\nThey exist for historical reasons, to get either a string or XML document. Nowadays, we should set the format in `xhr.responseType` and get `xhr.response` as demonstrated above.\n```\n\n## Ready states\n\n`XMLHttpRequest` changes between states as it progresses. The current state is accessible as  `xhr.readyState`.\n\nAll states, as in [the specification](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#states):\n\n```js\nUNSENT = 0; // initial state\nOPENED = 1; // open called\nHEADERS_RECEIVED = 2; // response headers received\nLOADING = 3; // response is loading (a data packed is received)\nDONE = 4; // request complete\n```\n\nAn `XMLHttpRequest` object travels them in the order `0` -> `1` -> `2` -> `3` -> ... -> `3` -> `4`. State `3` repeats every time a data packet is received over the network.\n\nWe can track them using `readystatechange` event:\n\n```js\nxhr.onreadystatechange = function() {\n  if (xhr.readyState == 3) {\n    // loading\n  }\n  if (xhr.readyState == 4) {\n    // request finished\n  }\n};\n```\n\nYou can find `readystatechange` listeners in really old code, it's there for historical reasons, as there was a time when there were no `load` and other events. Nowadays, `load/error/progress` handlers deprecate it.\n\n## Aborting request\n\nWe can terminate the request at any time. The call to `xhr.abort()` does that:\n\n```js\nxhr.abort(); // terminate the request\n```\n\nThat triggers `abort` event, and `xhr.status` becomes `0`.\n\n## Synchronous requests\n\nIf in the `open` method the third parameter `async` is set to `false`, the request is made synchronously.\n\nIn other words, JavaScript execution pauses at `send()` and resumes when the response is received. Somewhat like `alert` or `prompt` commands.\n\nHere's the rewritten example, the 3rd parameter of `open` is `false`:\n\n```js\nlet xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\nxhr.open('GET', '/article/xmlhttprequest/hello.txt', *!*false*/!*);\n\ntry {\n  xhr.send();\n  if (xhr.status != 200) {\n    alert(`Error ${xhr.status}: ${xhr.statusText}`);\n  } else {\n    alert(xhr.response);\n  }\n} catch(err) { // instead of onerror\n  alert(\"Request failed\");\n}\n```\n\nIt might look good, but synchronous calls are used rarely, because they block in-page JavaScript till the loading is complete. In some browsers it becomes impossible to scroll. If a synchronous call takes too much time, the browser may suggest to close the \"hanging\" webpage.\n\nMany advanced capabilities of `XMLHttpRequest`, like requesting from another domain or specifying a timeout, are unavailable for synchronous requests. Also, as you can see, no progress indication.\n\nBecause of all that, synchronous requests are used very sparingly, almost never. We won't talk about them any more.\n\n## HTTP-headers\n\n`XMLHttpRequest` allows both to send custom headers and read headers from the response.\n\nThere are 3 methods for HTTP-headers:\n\n`setRequestHeader(name, value)`\n: Sets the request header with the given `name` and `value`.\n\n    For instance:\n\n    ```js\n    xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');\n    ```\n\n    ```warn header=\"Headers limitations\"\n    Several headers are managed exclusively by the browser, e.g. `Referer` and `Host`.\n    The full list is [in the specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#the-setrequestheader-method).\n\n    `XMLHttpRequest` is not allowed to change them, for the sake of user safety and correctness of the request.\n    ```\n\n    ````warn header=\"Can't remove a header\"\n    Another peculiarity of `XMLHttpRequest` is that one can't undo `setRequestHeader`.\n\n    Once the header is set, it's set. Additional calls add information to the header, don't overwrite it.\n\n    For instance:\n\n    ```js\n    xhr.setRequestHeader('X-Auth', '123');\n    xhr.setRequestHeader('X-Auth', '456');\n\n    // the header will be:\n    // X-Auth: 123, 456\n    ```\n    ````\n\n`getResponseHeader(name)`\n: Gets the response header with the given `name` (except `Set-Cookie` and `Set-Cookie2`).\n\n    For instance:\n\n    ```js\n    xhr.getResponseHeader('Content-Type')\n    ```\n\n`getAllResponseHeaders()`\n: Returns all response headers, except `Set-Cookie` and `Set-Cookie2`.\n\n    Headers are returned as a single line, e.g.:\n\n    ```http\n    Cache-Control: max-age=31536000\n    Content-Length: 4260\n    Content-Type: image/png\n    Date: Sat, 08 Sep 2012 16:53:16 GMT\n    ```\n\n    The line break between headers is always `\"\\r\\n\"` (doesn't depend on OS), so we can easily split it into individual headers. The separator between the name and the value is always a colon followed by a space `\": \"`. That's fixed in the specification.\n\n    So, if we want to get an object with name/value pairs, we need to throw in a bit JS.\n\n    Like this (assuming that if two headers have the same name, then the latter one overwrites the former one):\n\n    ```js\n    let headers = xhr\n      .getAllResponseHeaders()\n      .split('\\r\\n')\n      .reduce((result, current) => {\n        let [name, value] = current.split(': ');\n        result[name] = value;\n        return result;\n      }, {});\n\n    // headers['Content-Type'] = 'image/png'\n    ```\n\n## POST, FormData\n\nTo make a POST request, we can use the built-in [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) object.\n\nThe syntax:\n\n```js\nlet formData = new FormData([form]); // creates an object, optionally fill from <form>\nformData.append(name, value); // appends a field\n```\n\nWe create it, optionally fill from a form, `append` more fields if needed, and then:\n\n1. `xhr.open('POST', ...)` – use `POST` method.\n2. `xhr.send(formData)` to submit the form to the server.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```html run refresh\n<form name=\"person\">\n  <input name=\"name\" value=\"John\">\n  <input name=\"surname\" value=\"Smith\">\n</form>\n\n<script>\n  // pre-fill FormData from the form\n  let formData = new FormData(document.forms.person);\n\n  // add one more field\n  formData.append(\"middle\", \"Lee\");\n\n  // send it out\n  let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  xhr.open(\"POST\", \"/article/xmlhttprequest/post/user\");\n  xhr.send(formData);\n\n  xhr.onload = () => alert(xhr.response);\n</script>\n```\n\nThe form is sent with `multipart/form-data` encoding.\n\nOr, if we like JSON more, then `JSON.stringify` and send as a string.\n\nJust don't forget to set the header `Content-Type: application/json`, many server-side frameworks automatically decode JSON with it:\n\n```js\nlet xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\nlet json = JSON.stringify({\n  name: \"John\",\n  surname: \"Smith\"\n});\n\nxhr.open(\"POST\", '/submit')\nxhr.setRequestHeader('Content-type', 'application/json; charset=utf-8');\n\nxhr.send(json);\n```\n\nThe `.send(body)` method is pretty omnivore. It can send almost any `body`, including `Blob` and `BufferSource` objects.\n\n## Upload progress\n\nThe `progress` event triggers only on the downloading stage.\n\nThat is: if we `POST` something, `XMLHttpRequest` first uploads our data (the request body), then downloads the response.\n\nIf we're uploading something big, then we're surely more interested in tracking the upload progress. But `xhr.onprogress` doesn't help here.\n\nThere's another object, without methods, exclusively to track upload events: `xhr.upload`.\n\nIt generates events, similar to `xhr`, but `xhr.upload` triggers them solely on uploading:\n\n- `loadstart` -- upload started.\n- `progress` -- triggers periodically during the upload.\n- `abort` -- upload aborted.\n- `error` -- non-HTTP error.\n- `load` -- upload finished successfully.\n- `timeout` -- upload timed out (if `timeout` property is set).\n- `loadend` -- upload finished with either success or error.\n\nExample of handlers:\n\n```js\nxhr.upload.onprogress = function(event) {\n  alert(`Uploaded ${event.loaded} of ${event.total} bytes`);\n};\n\nxhr.upload.onload = function() {\n  alert(`Upload finished successfully.`);\n};\n\nxhr.upload.onerror = function() {\n  alert(`Error during the upload: ${xhr.status}`);\n};\n```\n\nHere's a real-life example: file upload with progress indication:\n\n```html run\n<input type=\"file\" onchange=\"upload(this.files[0])\">\n\n<script>\nfunction upload(file) {\n  let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n  // track upload progress\n*!*\n  xhr.upload.onprogress = function(event) {\n    console.log(`Uploaded ${event.loaded} of ${event.total}`);\n  };\n*/!*\n\n  // track completion: both successful or not\n  xhr.onloadend = function() {\n    if (xhr.status == 200) {\n      console.log(\"success\");\n    } else {\n      console.log(\"error \" + this.status);\n    }\n  };\n\n  xhr.open(\"POST\", \"/article/xmlhttprequest/post/upload\");\n  xhr.send(file);\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n## Cross-origin requests\n\n`XMLHttpRequest` can make cross-origin requests, using the same CORS policy as [fetch](info:fetch-crossorigin).\n\nJust like `fetch`, it doesn't send cookies and HTTP-authorization to another origin by default. To enable them, set `xhr.withCredentials` to `true`:\n\n```js\nlet xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n*!*\nxhr.withCredentials = true;\n*/!*\n\nxhr.open('POST', 'http://anywhere.com/request');\n...\n```\n\nSee the chapter <info:fetch-crossorigin> for details about cross-origin headers.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nTypical code of the GET-request with `XMLHttpRequest`:\n\n```js\nlet xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\nxhr.open('GET', '/my/url');\n\nxhr.send();\n\nxhr.onload = function() {\n  if (xhr.status != 200) { // HTTP error?\n    // handle error\n    alert( 'Error: ' + xhr.status);\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // get the response from xhr.response\n};\n\nxhr.onprogress = function(event) {\n  // report progress\n  alert(`Loaded ${event.loaded} of ${event.total}`);\n};\n\nxhr.onerror = function() {\n  // handle non-HTTP error (e.g. network down)\n};\n```\n\nThere are actually more events, the [modern specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#events) lists them (in the lifecycle order):\n\n- `loadstart` -- the request has started.\n- `progress` -- a data packet of the response has arrived, the whole response body at the moment is in `response`.\n- `abort` -- the request was canceled by the call `xhr.abort()`.\n- `error` -- connection error has occurred, e.g. wrong domain name. Doesn't happen for HTTP-errors like 404.\n- `load` -- the request has finished successfully.\n- `timeout` -- the request was canceled due to timeout (only happens if it was set).\n- `loadend` -- triggers after `load`, `error`, `timeout` or `abort`.\n\nThe `error`, `abort`, `timeout`, and `load` events are mutually exclusive. Only one of them may happen.\n\nThe most used events are load completion (`load`), load failure (`error`), or we can use a single `loadend` handler and check the properties of the request object `xhr` to see what happened.\n\nWe've already seen another event: `readystatechange`. Historically, it appeared long ago, before the specification settled. Nowadays, there's no need to use it, we can replace it with newer events, but it can often be found in older scripts.\n\nIf we need to track uploading specifically, then we should listen to same events on `xhr.upload` object.",

        "content": "\n\nWith `fetch` method it's fairly easy to upload a file.\n\nHow to resume the upload after lost connection? There's no built-in option for that, but we have the pieces to implement it.\n\nResumable uploads should come with upload progress indication, as we expect big files (if we may need to resume). So, as `fetch` doesn't allow to track upload progress, we'll use [XMLHttpRequest](info:xmlhttprequest).\n\n## Not-so-useful progress event\n\nTo resume upload, we need to know how much was uploaded till the connection was lost.\n\nThere's `xhr.upload.onprogress` to track upload progress.\n\nUnfortunately, it won't help us to resume the upload here, as it triggers when the data is *sent*, but was it received by the server? The browser doesn't know.\n\nMaybe it was buffered by a local network proxy, or maybe the remote server process just died and couldn't process them, or it was just lost in the middle and didn't reach the receiver.\n\nThat's why this event is only useful to show a nice progress bar.\n\nTo resume upload, we need to know *exactly* the number of bytes received by the server. And only the server can tell that, so we'll make an additional request.\n\n## Algorithm\n\n1. First, create a file id, to uniquely identify the file we're going to upload:\n    ```js\n    let fileId = file.name + '-' + file.size + '-' + +file.lastModifiedDate;\n    ```\n    That's needed for resume upload, to tell the server what we're resuming.\n\n    If the name or the size or the last modification date changes, then there'll be another `fileId`.\n\n2. Send a request to the server, asking how many bytes it already has, like this:\n    ```js\n    let response = await fetch('status', {\n      headers: {\n        'X-File-Id': fileId\n      }\n    });\n\n    // The server has that many bytes\n    let startByte = +await response.text();\n    ```\n\n    This assumes that the server tracks file uploads by `X-File-Id` header. Should be implemented at server-side.\n\n    If the file doesn't yet exist at the server, then the server response should be `0`\n\n3. Then, we can use `Blob` method `slice` to send the file from `startByte`:\n    ```js\n    xhr.open(\"POST\", \"upload\", true);\n\n    // File id, so that the server knows which file we upload\n    xhr.setRequestHeader('X-File-Id', fileId);\n\n    // The byte we're resuming from, so the server knows we're resuming\n    xhr.setRequestHeader('X-Start-Byte', startByte);\n\n    xhr.upload.onprogress = (e) => {\n      console.log(`Uploaded ${startByte + e.loaded} of ${startByte + e.total}`);\n    };\n\n    // file can be from input.files[0] or another source\n    xhr.send(file.slice(startByte));\n    ```\n\n    Here we send the server both file id as `X-File-Id`, so it knows which file we're uploading, and the starting byte as `X-Start-Byte`, so it knows we're not uploading it initially, but resuming.\n\n    The server should check its records, and if there was an upload of that file, and the current uploaded size is exactly `X-Start-Byte`, then append the data to it.\n\n\nHere's the demo with both client and server code, written on Node.js.\n\nIt works only partially on this site, as Node.js is behind another server named Nginx, that buffers uploads, passing them to Node.js when fully complete.\n\nBut you can download it and run locally for the full demonstration:\n\n[codetabs src=\"upload-resume\" height=200]\n\nAs we can see, modern networking methods are close to file managers in their capabilities -- control over headers, progress indicator, sending file parts, etc.\n\nWe can implement resumable upload and much more.",

        "content": "\n\nLong polling is the simplest way of having persistent connection with server, that doesn't use any specific protocol like WebSocket or Server Side Events.\n\nBeing very easy to implement, it's also good enough in a lot of cases.\n\n## Regular Polling\n\nThe simplest way to get new information from the server is periodic polling. That is, regular requests to the server: \"Hello, I'm here, do you have any information for me?\". For example, once in 10 seconds.\n\nIn response, the server first takes a notice to itself that the client is online, and second - sends a packet of messages it got till that moment.\n\nThat works, but there are downsides:\n1. Messages are passed with a delay up to 10 seconds (between requests).\n2. Even if there are no messages, the server is bombed with requests every 10 seconds, even if the user switched somewhere else or is asleep. That's quite a load to handle, speaking performance-wise.\n\nSo, if we're talking about a very small service, the approach may be viable, but generally, it needs an improvement.\n\n## Long polling\n\nSo-called \"long polling\" is a much better way to poll the server.\n\nIt's also very easy to implement, and delivers messages without delays.\n\nThe flow:\n\n1. A request is sent to the server.\n2. The server doesn't close the connection until it has a message to send.\n3. When a message appears - the server responds to the request with it.\n4. The browser makes a new request immediately.\n\nThe situation when the browser sent a request and has a pending connection with the server, is standard for this method. Only when a message is delivered, the connection is reestablished.\n\n![](long-polling.svg)\n\nIf the connection is lost, because of, say, a network error, the browser immediately sends a new request.\n\nA sketch of client-side `subscribe` function that makes long requests:\n\n```js\nasync function subscribe() {\n  let response = await fetch(\"/subscribe\");\n\n  if (response.status == 502) {\n    // Status 502 is a connection timeout error,\n    // may happen when the connection was pending for too long,\n    // and the remote server or a proxy closed it\n    // let's reconnect\n    await subscribe();\n  } else if (response.status != 200) {\n    // An error - let's show it\n    showMessage(response.statusText);\n    // Reconnect in one second\n    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));\n    await subscribe();\n  } else {\n    // Get and show the message\n    let message = await response.text();\n    showMessage(message);\n    // Call subscribe() again to get the next message\n    await subscribe();\n  }\n}\n\nsubscribe();\n```\n\nAs you can see, `subscribe` function makes a fetch, then waits for the response, handles it and calls itself again.\n\n```warn header=\"Server should be ok with many pending connections\"\nThe server architecture must be able to work with many pending connections.\n\nCertain server architectures run a process per connect. For many connections there will be as many processes, and each process takes a lot of memory. So many connections just consume it all.\n\nThat's often the case for backends written in PHP, Ruby languages, but technically isn't a language, but rather implementation issue. Most modern language allow to implement a proper backend, but some of them make it easier than the other.\n\nBackends written using Node.js usually don't have such problems.\n```\n\n## Demo: a chat\n\nHere's a demo chat, you can also download it and run locally (if you're familiar with Node.js and can install modules):\n\n[codetabs src=\"longpoll\" height=500]\n\nBrowser code is in `browser.js`.\n\n## Area of usage\n\nLong polling works great in situations when messages are rare.\n\nIf messages come very often, then the chart of requesting-receiving messages, painted above, becomes saw-like.\n\nEvery message is a separate request, supplied with headers, authentication overhead, and so on.\n\nSo, in this case, another method is preferred, such as [Websocket](info:websocket) or [Server Sent Events](info:server-sent-events).",

        "content": "\n\nThe `WebSocket` protocol, described in the specification [RFC 6455](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) provides a way to exchange data between browser and server via a persistent connection. The data can be passed in both directions as \"packets\", without breaking the connection and additional HTTP-requests.\n\nWebSocket is especially great for services that require continuous data exchange, e.g. online games, real-time trading systems and so on.\n\n## A simple example\n\nTo open a websocket connection, we need to create `new WebSocket` using the special protocol `ws` in the url:\n\n```js\nlet socket = new WebSocket(\"*!*ws*/!*://javascript.info\");\n```\n\nThere's also encrypted `wss://` protocol. It's like HTTPS for websockets.\n\n```smart header=\"Always prefer `wss://`\"\nThe `wss://` protocol is not only encrypted, but also more reliable.\n\nThat's because `ws://` data is not encrypted, visible for any intermediary. Old proxy servers do not know about WebSocket, they may see \"strange\" headers and abort the connection.\n\nOn the other hand, `wss://` is WebSocket over TLS, (same as HTTPS is HTTP over TLS), the transport security layer encrypts the data at sender and decrypts at the receiver. So data packets are passed encrypted through proxies. They can't see what's inside and let them through.\n```\n\nOnce the socket is created, we should listen to events on it. There are totally 4 events:\n- **`open`** -- connection established,\n- **`message`** -- data received,\n- **`error`** -- websocket error,\n- **`close`** -- connection closed.\n\n...And if we'd like to send something, then `socket.send(data)` will do that.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```js run\nlet socket = new WebSocket(\"wss://javascript.info/article/websocket/demo/hello\");\n\nsocket.onopen = function(e) {\n  alert(\"[open] Connection established\");\n  alert(\"Sending to server\");\n  socket.send(\"My name is John\");\n};\n\nsocket.onmessage = function(event) {\n  alert(`[message] Data received from server: ${event.data}`);\n};\n\nsocket.onclose = function(event) {\n  if (event.wasClean) {  \n    alert(`[close] Connection closed cleanly, code=${event.code} reason=${event.reason}`);\n  } else {\n    // e.g. server process killed or network down\n    // event.code is usually 1006 in this case\n    alert('[close] Connection died');\n  }\n};\n\nsocket.onerror = function(error) {\n  alert(`[error] ${error.message}`);\n};\n```\n\nFor demo purposes, there's a small server [server.js](demo/server.js) written in Node.js, for the example above, running. It responds with \"Hello from server, John\", then waits 5 seconds and closes the connection.\n\nSo you'll see events `open` -> `message` -> `close`.\n\nThat's actually it, we can talk WebSocket already. Quite simple, isn't it?\n\nNow let's talk more in-depth.\n\n## Opening a websocket\n\nWhen `new WebSocket(url)` is created, it starts connecting immediately.\n\nDuring the connection the browser (using headers) asks the server: \"Do you support Websocket?\" And if the server replies \"yes\", then the talk continues in WebSocket protocol, which is not HTTP at all.\n\n![](websocket-handshake.svg)\n\nHere's an example of browser headers for request made by `new WebSocket(\"wss://javascript.info/chat\")`.\n\n```\nGET /chat\nHost: javascript.info\nOrigin: https://javascript.info\nConnection: Upgrade\nUpgrade: websocket\nSec-WebSocket-Key: Iv8io/9s+lYFgZWcXczP8Q==\nSec-WebSocket-Version: 13\n```\n\n- `Origin` -- the origin of the client page, e.g. `https://javascript.info`. WebSocket objects are cross-origin by nature. There are no special headers or other limitations. Old servers are unable to handle WebSocket anyway, so there are no compabitility issues. But `Origin` header is important, as it allows the server to decide whether or not to talk WebSocket with this website.\n- `Connection: Upgrade` -- signals that the client would like to change the protocol.\n- `Upgrade: websocket` -- the requested protocol is \"websocket\".\n- `Sec-WebSocket-Key` -- a random browser-generated key for security.\n- `Sec-WebSocket-Version` -- WebSocket protocol version, 13 is the current one.\n\n```smart header=\"WebSocket handshake can't be emulated\"\nWe can't use `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch` to make this kind of HTTP-request, because JavaScript is not allowed to set these headers.\n```\n\nIf the server agrees to switch to WebSocket, it should send code 101 response:\n\n```\n101 Switching Protocols\nUpgrade: websocket\nConnection: Upgrade\nSec-WebSocket-Accept: hsBlbuDTkk24srzEOTBUlZAlC2g=\n```\n\nHere `Sec-WebSocket-Accept` is `Sec-WebSocket-Key`, recoded using a special algorithm. The browser uses it to make sure that the response corresponds to the request.\n\nAfterwards, the data is transfered using WebSocket protocol, we'll see its structure (\"frames\") soon. And that's not HTTP at all.\n\n### Extensions and subprotocols\n\nThere may be additional headers `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` and `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` that describe extensions and subprotocols.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: deflate-frame` means that the browser supports data compression. An extension is something related to transferring the data, functionality that extends WebSocket protocol. The header `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` is sent automatically by the browser, with the list of all extenions it supports.\n\n- `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: soap, wamp` means that we'd like to transfer not just any data, but the data in [SOAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) or WAMP (\"The WebSocket Application Messaging Protocol\") protocols. WebSocket subprotocols are registered in the [IANA catalogue](http://www.iana.org/assignments/websocket/websocket.xml). So, this header describes data formats that we're going to use.\n\n    This optional header is set using the second parameter of `new WebSocket`. That's the array of subprotocols, e.g. if we'd like to use SOAP or WAMP:\n\n    ```js\n    let socket = new WebSocket(\"wss://javascript.info/chat\", [\"soap\", \"wamp\"]);\n    ```\n\nThe server should respond with a list of protocols and extensions that it agrees to use.\n\nFor example, the request:\n\n```\nGET /chat\nHost: javascript.info\nUpgrade: websocket\nConnection: Upgrade\nOrigin: https://javascript.info\nSec-WebSocket-Key: Iv8io/9s+lYFgZWcXczP8Q==\nSec-WebSocket-Version: 13\n*!*\nSec-WebSocket-Extensions: deflate-frame\nSec-WebSocket-Protocol: soap, wamp\n*/!*\n```\n\nResponse:\n\n```\n101 Switching Protocols\nUpgrade: websocket\nConnection: Upgrade\nSec-WebSocket-Accept: hsBlbuDTkk24srzEOTBUlZAlC2g=\n*!*\nSec-WebSocket-Extensions: deflate-frame\nSec-WebSocket-Protocol: soap\n*/!*\n```\n\nHere the server responds that it supports the extension \"deflate-frame\", and only SOAP of the requested subprotocols.\n\n## Data transfer\n\nWebSocket communication consists of \"frames\" -- data fragments, that can be sent from either side, and can be of several kinds:\n\n- \"text frames\" -- contain text data that parties send to each other.\n- \"binary data frames\" -- contain binary data that parties send to each other.\n- \"ping/pong frames\" are used to check the connection, sent from the server, the browser responds to these automatically.\n- there's also \"connection close frame\" and a few other service frames.\n\nIn the browser, we directly work only with text or binary frames.\n\n**WebSocket `.send()` method can send either text or binary data.**\n\nA call `socket.send(body)` allows `body` in string or a binary format, including `Blob`, `ArrayBuffer`, etc. No settings required: just send it out in any format.\n\n**When we receive the data, text always comes as string. And for binary data, we can choose between `Blob` and `ArrayBuffer` formats.**\n\nThat's set by `socket.bufferType` property, it's `\"blob\"` by default, so binary data comes as `Blob` objects.\n\n[Blob](info:blob) is a high-level binary object, it directly integrates with `<a>`, `<img>` and other tags, so that's a sane default. But for binary processing, to access individual data bytes, we can change it to `\"arraybuffer\"`:\n\n```js\nsocket.bufferType = \"arraybuffer\";\nsocket.onmessage = (event) => {\n  // event.data is either a string (if text) or arraybuffer (if binary)\n};\n```\n\n## Rate limiting\n\nImagine, our app is generating a lot of data to send. But the user has a slow network connection, maybe on a mobile internet, outside of a city.\n\nWe can call `socket.send(data)` again and again. But the data will be buffered (stored) in memory and sent out only as fast as network speed allows.\n\nThe `socket.bufferedAmount` property stores how many bytes are buffered at this moment, waiting to be sent over the network.\n\nWe can examine it to see whether the socket is actually available for transmission.\n\n```js\n// every 100ms examine the socket and send more data  \n// only if all the existing data was sent out\nsetInterval(() => {\n  if (socket.bufferedAmount == 0) {\n    socket.send(moreData());\n  }\n}, 100);\n```\n\n\n## Connection close\n\nNormally, when a party wants to close the connection (both browser and server have equal rights), they send a \"connection close frame\" with a numeric code and a textual reason.\n\nThe method for that is:\n```js\nsocket.close([code], [reason]);\n```\n\n- `code` is a special WebSocket closing code (optional)\n- `reason` is a string that describes the reason of closing (optional)\n\nThen the other party in `close` event handler gets the code and the reason, e.g.:\n\n```js\n// closing party:\nsocket.close(1000, \"Work complete\");\n\n// the other party\nsocket.onclose = event => {\n  // event.code === 1000\n  // event.reason === \"Work complete\"\n  // event.wasClean === true (clean close)\n};\n```\n\nMost common code values:\n\n- `1000` -- the default, normal closure (used if no `code` supplied),\n- `1006` -- no way to such code manually, indicates that the connection was lost (no close frame).\n\nThere are other codes like:\n\n- `1001` -- the party is going away, e.g. server is shutting down, or a browser leaves the page,\n- `1009` -- the message is too big to process,\n- `1011` -- unexpected error on server,\n- ...and so on.\n\nThe full list can be found in [RFC6455, §7.4.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1).\n\nWebSocket codes are somewhat like HTTP codes, but different. In particular, any codes less than `1000` are reserved, there'll be an error if we try to set such a code.\n\n```js\n// in case connection is broken\nsocket.onclose = event => {\n  // event.code === 1006\n  // event.reason === \"\"\n  // event.wasClean === false (no closing frame)\n};\n```\n\n\n## Connection state\n\nTo get connection state, additionally there's `socket.readyState` property with values:\n\n- **`0`** -- \"CONNECTING\": the connection has not yet been established,\n- **`1`** -- \"OPEN\": communicating,\n- **`2`** -- \"CLOSING\": the connection is closing,\n- **`3`** -- \"CLOSED\": the connection is closed.\n\n\n## Chat example\n\nLet's review a chat example using browser WebSocket API and Node.js WebSocket module <https://github.com/websockets/ws>. We'll pay the main attention to the client side, but the server is also simple.\n\nHTML: we need a `<form>` to send messages and a `<div>` for incoming messages:\n\n```html\n<!-- message form -->\n<form name=\"publish\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"message\">\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Send\">\n</form>\n\n<!-- div with messages -->\n<div id=\"messages\"></div>\n```\n\nFrom JavaScript we want three things:\n1. Open the connection.\n2. On form submission -- `socket.send(message)` for the message.\n3. On incoming message -- append it to `div#messages`.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```js\nlet socket = new WebSocket(\"wss://javascript.info/article/websocket/chat/ws\");\n\n// send message from the form\ndocument.forms.publish.onsubmit = function() {\n  let outgoingMessage = this.message.value;\n\n  socket.send(outgoingMessage);\n  return false;\n};\n\n// message received - show the message in div#messages\nsocket.onmessage = function(event) {\n  let message = event.data;\n\n  let messageElem = document.createElement('div');\n  messageElem.textContent = message;\n  document.getElementById('messages').prepend(messageElem);\n}\n```\n\nServer-side code is a little bit beyond our scope. Here we'll use Node.js, but you don't have to. Other platforms also have their means to work with WebSocket.\n\nThe server-side algorithm will be:\n\n1. Create `clients = new Set()` -- a set of sockets.\n2. For each accepted websocket, add it to the set `clients.add(socket)` and setup `message` event listener to get its messages.\n3. When a message received: iterate over clients and send it to everyone.\n4. When a connection is closed: `clients.delete(socket)`.\n\n```js\nconst ws = new require('ws');\nconst wss = new ws.Server({noServer: true});\n\nconst clients = new Set();\n\nhttp.createServer((req, res) => {\n  // here we only handle websocket connections\n  // in real project we'd have some other code here to handle non-websocket requests\n  wss.handleUpgrade(req, req.socket, Buffer.alloc(0), onSocketConnect);\n});\n\nfunction onSocketConnect(ws) {\n  clients.add(ws);\n\n  ws.on('message', function(message) {\n    message = message.slice(0, 50); // max message length will be 50\n\n    for(let client of clients) {\n      client.send(message);\n    }\n  });\n\n  ws.on('close', function() {\n    clients.delete(ws);\n  });\n}\n```\n\n\nHere's the working example:\n\n[iframe src=\"chat\" height=\"100\" zip]\n\nYou can also download it (upper-right button in the iframe) and run locally. Just don't forget to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and `npm install ws` before running.\n\n## Summary\n\nWebSocket is a modern way to have persistent browser-server connections.\n\n- WebSockets don't have cross-origin limitations.\n- They are well-supported in browsers.\n- Can send/receive strings and binary data.\n\nThe API is simple.\n\nMethods:\n- `socket.send(data)`,\n- `socket.close([code], [reason])`.\n\nEvents:\n- `open`,\n- `message`,\n- `error`,\n- `close`.\n\nWebSocket by itself does not include reconnection, authentication and many other high-level mechanisms. So there are client/server libraries for that, and it's also possible to implement these capabilities manually.\n\nSometimes, to integrate WebSocket into existing project, people run WebSocket server in parallel with the main HTTP-server, and they share a single database. Requests to WebSocket use `wss://ws.site.com`, a subdomain that leads to WebSocket server, while `https://site.com` goes to the main HTTP-server.\n\nSurely, other ways of integration are also possible.",

        "content": "\n\nThe [Server-Sent Events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#the-eventsource-interface) specification describes a built-in class `EventSource`, that keeps connection with the server and allows to receive events from it.\n\nSimilar to `WebSocket`, the connection is persistent.\n\nBut there are several important differences:\n\n| `WebSocket` | `EventSource` |\n|-------------|---------------|\n| Bi-directional: both client and server can exchange messages | One-directional: only server sends data |\n| Binary and text data | Only text |\n| WebSocket protocol | Regular HTTP |\n\n`EventSource` is a less-powerful way of communicating with the server than `WebSocket`.\n\nWhy should one ever use it?\n\nThe main reason: it's simpler. In many applications, the power of `WebSocket` is a little bit too much.\n\nWe need to receive a stream of data from server: maybe chat messages or market prices, or whatever. That's what `EventSource` is good at. Also it supports auto-reconnect, something  we need to implement manually with `WebSocket`. Besides, it's a plain old HTTP, not a new protocol.\n\n## Getting messages\n\nTo start receiving messages, we just need to create `new EventSource(url)`.\n\nThe browser will connect to `url` and keep the connection open, waiting for events.\n\nThe server should respond with status 200 and the header `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, then keep the connection and write messages into it in the special format, like this:\n\n```\ndata: Message 1\n\ndata: Message 2\n\ndata: Message 3\ndata: of two lines\n```\n\n- A message text goes after `data:`, the space after the colon is optional.\n- Messages are delimited with double line breaks `\\n\\n`.\n- To send a line break `\\n`, we can immediately send one more `data:` (3rd message above).\n\nIn practice, complex messages are usually sent JSON-encoded. Line-breaks are encoded as `\\n` within them, so multiline `data:` messages are not necessary.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js\ndata: {\"user\":\"John\",\"message\":\"First line*!*\\n*/!* Second line\"}\n```\n\n...So we can assume that one `data:` holds exactly one message.\n\nFor each such message, the `message` event is generated:\n\n```js\nlet eventSource = new EventSource(\"/events/subscribe\");\n\neventSource.onmessage = function(event) {\n  console.log(\"New message\", event.data);\n  // will log 3 times for the data stream above\n};\n\n// or eventSource.addEventListener('message', ...)\n```\n\n### Cross-origin requests\n\n`EventSource` supports cross-origin requests, like `fetch` any other networking methods. We can use any URL:\n\n```js\nlet source = new EventSource(\"https://another-site.com/events\");\n```\n\nThe remote server will get the `Origin` header and must respond with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to proceed.\n\nTo pass credentials, we should set the additional option `withCredentials`, like this:\n\n```js\nlet source = new EventSource(\"https://another-site.com/events\", {\n  withCredentials: true\n});\n```\n\nPlease see the chapter <info:fetch-crossorigin> for more details about cross-origin headers.\n\n\n## Reconnection\n\nUpon creation, `new EventSource` connects to the server, and if the connection is broken -- reconnects.\n\nThat's very convenient, as we don't have to care about it.\n\nThere's a small delay between reconnections, a few seconds by default.\n\nThe server can set the recommended delay using `retry:` in response (in milliseconds):\n\n```js\nretry: 15000\ndata: Hello, I set the reconnection delay to 15 seconds\n```\n\nThe `retry:` may come both together with some data, or as a standalone message.\n\nThe browser should wait that many milliseconds before reconnecting. Or longer, e.g. if the browser knows (from OS) that there's no network connection at the moment, it may wait until the connection appears, and then retry.\n\n- If the server wants the browser to stop reconnecting, it should respond with HTTP status 204.\n- If the browser wants to close the connection, it should call `eventSource.close()`:\n\n```js\nlet eventSource = new EventSource(...);\n\neventSource.close();\n```\n\nAlso, there will be no reconnection if the response has an incorrect `Content-Type` or its HTTP status differs from 301, 307, 200 and 204. In such cases the `\"error\"` event will be emitted, and the browser won't reconnect.\n\n```smart\nWhen a connection is finally closed, there's no way to \"reopen\" it. If we'd like to connect again, just create a new `EventSource`.\n```\n\n## Message id\n\nWhen a connection breaks due to network problems, either side can't be sure which messages were received, and which weren't.\n\nTo correctly resume the connection, each message should have an `id` field, like this:\n\n```\ndata: Message 1\nid: 1\n\ndata: Message 2\nid: 2\n\ndata: Message 3\ndata: of two lines\nid: 3\n```\n\nWhen a message with `id:` is received, the browser:\n\n- Sets the property `eventSource.lastEventId` to its value.\n- Upon reconnection sends the header `Last-Event-ID` with that `id`, so that the server may re-send following messages.\n\n```smart header=\"Put `id:` after `data:`\"\nPlease note: the `id` is appended below message `data` by the server, to ensure that `lastEventId` is updated after the message is received.\n```\n\n## Connection status: readyState\n\nThe `EventSource` object has `readyState` property, that has one of three values:\n\n```js no-beautify\nEventSource.CONNECTING = 0; // connecting or reconnecting\nEventSource.OPEN = 1;       // connected\nEventSource.CLOSED = 2;     // connection closed\n```\n\nWhen an object is created, or the connection is down, it's always `EventSource.CONNECTING` (equals `0`).\n\nWe can query this property to know the state of `EventSource`.\n\n## Event types\n\nBy default `EventSource` object generates three events:\n\n- `message` -- a message received, available as `event.data`.\n- `open` -- the connection is open.\n- `error` -- the connection could not be established, e.g. the server returned HTTP 500 status.\n\nThe server may specify another type of event with `event: ...` at the event start.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nevent: join\ndata: Bob\n\ndata: Hello\n\nevent: leave\ndata: Bob\n```\n\nTo handle custom events, we must use `addEventListener`, not `onmessage`:\n\n```js\neventSource.addEventListener('join', event => {\n  alert(`Joined ${event.data}`);\n});\n\neventSource.addEventListener('message', event => {\n  alert(`Said: ${event.data}`);\n});\n\neventSource.addEventListener('leave', event => {\n  alert(`Left ${event.data}`);\n});\n```\n\n## Full example\n\nHere's the server that sends messages with `1`, `2`, `3`, then `bye` and breaks the connection.\n\nThen the browser automatically reconnects.\n\n[codetabs src=\"eventsource\"]\n\n## Summary\n\n`EventSource` object automatically establishes a persistent connection and allows the server to send messages over it.\n\nIt offers:\n- Automatic reconnect, with tunable `retry` timeout.\n- Message ids to resume events, the last received identifier is sent in `Last-Event-ID` header upon reconnection.\n- The current state is in the `readyState` property.\n\nThat makes `EventSource` a viable alternative to `WebSocket`, as it's more low-level and lacks such built-in features (though they can be implemented).\n\nIn many real-life applications, the power of `EventSource` is just enough.\n\nSupported in all modern browsers (not IE).\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\nlet source = new EventSource(url, [credentials]);\n```\n\nThe second argument has only one possible option: `{ withCredentials: true }`, it allows sending cross-origin credentials.\n\nOverall cross-origin security is same as for `fetch` and other network methods.\n\n### Properties of an `EventSource` object\n\n`readyState`\n: The current connection state: either `EventSource.CONNECTING (=0)`, `EventSource.OPEN (=1)` or `EventSource.CLOSED (=2)`.\n\n`lastEventId`\n: The last received `id`. Upon reconnection the browser sends it in the header `Last-Event-ID`.\n\n### Methods\n\n`close()`\n: Closes the connection.\n\n### Events\n\n`message`\n: Message received, the data is in `event.data`.\n\n`open`\n: The connection is established.\n\n`error`\n: In case of an error, including both lost connection (will auto-reconnect) and fatal errors. We can check `readyState` to see if the reconnection is being attempted.\n\nThe server may set a custom event name in `event:`. Such events should be handled using `addEventListener`, not `on<event>`.\n\n### Server response format\n\nThe server sends messages, delimited by `\\n\\n`.\n\nA message may have following fields:\n\n- `data:` -- message body, a sequence of multiple `data` is interpreted as a single message, with `\\n` between the parts.\n- `id:` -- renews `lastEventId`, sent in `Last-Event-ID` on reconnect.\n- `retry:` -- recommends a retry delay for reconnections in ms. There's no way to set it from JavaScript.\n- `event:` -- event name, must precede `data:`.\n\nA message may include one or more fields in any order, but `id:` usually goes the last.",

        "content": "\n\nCookies are small strings of data that are stored directly in the browser. They are a part of HTTP protocol, defined by [RFC 6265](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) specification.\n\nCookies are usually set by a web-server using response `Set-Cookie` HTTP-header. Then the browser automatically adds them to (almost) every request to the same domain using `Cookie` HTTP-header.\n\nOne of the most widespread use cases is authentication:\n\n1. Upon sign in, the server uses `Set-Cookie` HTTP-header in the response to set a cookie with a unique \"session identifier\".\n2. Next time when the request is set to the same domain, the browser sends the cookie over the net using `Cookie` HTTP-header.\n3. So the server knows who made the request.\n\nWe can also access cookies from the browser, using `document.cookie` property.\n\nThere are many tricky things about cookies and their options. In this chapter we'll cover them in detail.\n\n## Reading from document.cookie\n\n```online\nDoes your browser store any cookies from this site? Let's see:\n```\n\n```offline\nAssuming you're on a website, it's possible to see the cookies from it, like this:\n```\n\n```js run\n// At javascript.info, we use Google Analytics for statistics,\n// so there should be some cookies\nalert( document.cookie ); // cookie1=value1; cookie2=value2;...\n```\n\n\nThe value of `document.cookie` consists of `name=value` pairs, delimited by `; `. Each one is a separate cookie.\n\nTo find a particular cookie, we can split `document.cookie` by `; `, and then find the right name. We can use either a regular expression or array functions to do that.\n\nWe leave it as an exercise for the reader. Also, at the end of the chapter you'll find helper functions to manipulate cookies.\n\n## Writing to document.cookie\n\nWe can write to `document.cookie`. But it's not a data property, it's an accessor (getter/setter). An assignment to it is treated specially.\n\n**A write operation to `document.cookie` updates only cookies mentioned in it, but doesn't touch other cookies.**\n\nFor instance, this call sets a cookie with the name `user` and value `John`:\n\n```js run\ndocument.cookie = \"user=John\"; // update only cookie named 'user'\nalert(document.cookie); // show all cookies\n```\n\nIf you run it, then probably you'll see multiple cookies. That's because `document.cookie=` operation does not overwrite all cookies. It only sets the mentioned cookie `user`.\n\nTechnically, name and value can have any characters, to keep the valid formatting they should be escaped using a built-in `encodeURIComponent` function:\n\n```js run\n// special characters (spaces), need encoding\nlet name = \"my name\";\nlet value = \"John Smith\"\n\n// encodes the cookie as my%20name=John%20Smith\ndocument.cookie = encodeURIComponent(name) + '=' + encodeURIComponent(value);\n\nalert(document.cookie); // ...; my%20name=John%20Smith\n```\n\n\n```warn header=\"Limitations\"\nThere are few limitations:\n- The `name=value` pair, after `encodeURIComponent`, should not exceed 4kb. So we can't store anything huge in a cookie.\n- The total number of cookies per domain is limited to around 20+, the exact limit depends on a browser.\n```\n\nCookies have several options, many of them are important and should be set.\n\nThe options are listed after `key=value`, delimited by `;`, like this:\n\n```js run\ndocument.cookie = \"user=John; path=/; expires=Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT\"\n```\n\n## path\n\n- **`path=/mypath`**\n\nThe url path prefix, the cookie will be accessible for pages under that path. Must be absolute. By default, it's the current path.\n\nIf a cookie is set with `path=/admin`, it's visible at pages `/admin` and `/admin/something`, but not at `/home` or `/adminpage`.\n\nUsually, we should set `path` to the root: `path=/` to make the cookie accessible from all website pages.\n\n## domain\n\n- **`domain=site.com`**\n\nA domain where the cookie is accessible. In practice though, there are limitations. We can't set any domain.\n\nBy default, a cookie is accessible only at the domain that set it. So, if the cookie was set by `site.com`, we won't get it `other.com`.\n\n...But what's more tricky, we also won't get the cookie at a subdomain `forum.site.com`!\n\n```js\n// at site.com\ndocument.cookie = \"user=John\"\n\n// at forum.site.com\nalert(document.cookie); // no user\n```\n\n**There's no way to let a cookie be accessible from another 2nd-level domain, so `other.com` will never receive a cookie set at `site.com`.**\n\nIt's a safety restriction, to allow us to store sensitive data in cookies, that should be available only on one site.\n\n...But if we'd like to allow subdomains like `forum.site.com` get a cookie, that's possible. When setting a cookie at `site.com`, we should explicitly set `domain` option to the root domain: `domain=site.com`:\n\n```js\n// at site.com\n// make the cookie accessible on any subdomain *.site.com:\ndocument.cookie = \"user=John; domain=site.com\"\n\n// later\n\n// at forum.site.com\nalert(document.cookie); // has cookie user=John\n```\n\nFor historical reasons, `domain=.site.com` (a dot before `site.com`) also works the same way, allowing access to the cookie from subdomains. That's an old notation, should be used if we need to support very old browsers.\n\nSo, `domain` option allows to make a cookie accessible at subdomains.\n\n## expires, max-age\n\nBy default, if a cookie doesn't have one of these options, it disappears when the browser is closed. Such cookies are called \"session cookies\"\n\nTo let cookies survive browser close, we can set either `expires` or `max-age` option.\n\n- **`expires=Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT`**\n\nCookie expiration date, when the browser will delete it automatically.\n\nThe date must be exactly in this format, in GMT timezone. We can use `date.toUTCString` to get it. For instance, we can set the cookie to expire in 1 day:\n\n```js\n// +1 day from now\nlet date = new Date(Date.now() + 86400e3);\ndate = date.toUTCString();\ndocument.cookie = \"user=John; expires=\" + date;\n```\n\nIf we set `expires` to a date in the past, the cookie is deleted.\n\n-  **`max-age=3600`**\n\nAn alternative to `expires`, specifies the cookie expiration in seconds from the current moment.\n\nIf zero or negative, then the cookie is deleted:\n\n```js\n// cookie will die +1 hour from now\ndocument.cookie = \"user=John; max-age=3600\";\n\n// delete cookie (let it expire right now)\ndocument.cookie = \"user=John; max-age=0\";\n```\n\n## secure\n\n- **`secure`**\n\nThe cookie should be transferred only over HTTPS.\n\n**By default, if we set a cookie at `http://site.com`, then it also appears at `https://site.com` and vice versa.**\n\nThat is, cookies are domain-based, they do not distinguish between the protocols.\n\nWith this option, if a cookie is set by `https://site.com`, then it doesn't appear when the same site is accessed by HTTP, as `http://site.com`. So if a cookie has sensitive content that should never be sent over unencrypted HTTP, then the flag is the right thing.\n\n```js\n// assuming we're on https:// now\n// set the cookie secure (only accessible if over HTTPS)\ndocument.cookie = \"user=John; secure\";\n```  \n\n## samesite\n\nThat's another security attribute `samesite`. It's designed to protect from so-called XSRF (cross-site request forgery) attacks.\n\nTo understand how it works and when it's useful, let's take a look at XSRF attacks.\n\n### XSRF attack\n\nImagine, you are logged into the site `bank.com`. That is: you have an authentication cookie from that site. Your browser sends it to `bank.com` with every request, so that it recognizes you and performs all sensitive financial operations.\n\nNow, while browsing the web in another window, you accidentally come to another site `evil.com`. That site has JavaScript code that submits a form `<form action=\"https://bank.com/pay\">` to `bank.com` with fields that initiate a transaction to the hacker's account.\n\nThe browser sends cookies every time you visit the site `bank.com`, even if the form was submitted from `evil.com`. So the bank recognizes you and actually performs the payment.\n\n![](cookie-xsrf.svg)\n\nThat's called a \"Cross-Site Request Forgery\" (in short, XSRF) attack.\n\nReal banks are protected from it of course. All forms generated by `bank.com` have a special field, so called \"XSRF protection token\", that an evil page can't generate or extract from a remote page (it can submit a form there, but can't get the data back). And the site `bank.com` checks for such token in every form it receives.\n\nBut such protection takes time to implement: we need to ensure that every form has the token field, and we must also check all requests.\n\n### Enter cookie samesite option\n\nThe cookie `samesite` option provides another way to protect from such attacks, that (in theory) should not require \"xsrf protection tokens\".\n\nIt has two possible values:\n\n- **`samesite=strict` (same as `samesite` without value)**\n\nA cookie with `samesite=strict` is never sent if the user comes from outside the same site.\n\nIn other words, whether a user follows a link from their mail or submits a form from `evil.com`, or does any operation that originates from another domain, the cookie is not sent.\n\nIf authentication cookies have `samesite` option, then XSRF attack has no chances to succeed, because a submission from `evil.com` comes without cookies. So `bank.com` will not recognize the user and will not proceed with the payment.\n\nThe protection is quite reliable. Only operations that come from `bank.com` will send the `samesite` cookie, e.g. a form submission from another page at `bank.com`.\n\nAlthough, there's a small inconvenience.\n\nWhen a user follows a legitimate link to `bank.com`, like from their own notes, they'll be surprised that `bank.com` does not recognize them. Indeed, `samesite=strict` cookies are not sent in that case.\n\nWe could work around that by using two cookies: one for \"general recognition\", only for the purposes of saying: \"Hello, John\", and the other one for data-changing operations with `samesite=strict`. Then a person coming from outside of the site will see a welcome, but payments must be initiated from the bank website, for the second cookie to be sent.\n\n- **`samesite=lax`**\n\nA more relaxed approach that also protects from XSRF and doesn't break user experience.\n\nLax mode, just like `strict`, forbids the browser to send cookies when coming from outside the site, but adds an exception.\n\nA `samesite=lax` cookie is sent if both of these conditions are true:\n1. The HTTP method is \"safe\" (e.g. GET, but not POST).\n\n    The full list of safe HTTP methods is in the [RFC7231 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231). Basically, these are the methods that should be used for reading, but not writing the data. They must not perform any data-changing operations. Following a link is always GET, the safe method.\n\n2. The operation performs top-level navigation (changes URL in the browser address bar).\n\n    That's usually true, but if the navigation is performed in an `<iframe>`, then it's not top-level. Also, JavaScript methods for network requests do not perform any navigation, hence they don't fit.\n\nSo, what `samesite=lax` does is basically allows a most common \"go to URL\" operation to have cookies. E.g. opening a website link from notes satisfies these conditions.\n\nBut anything more complicated, like a network request from another site or a form submission loses cookies.\n\nIf that's fine for you, then adding `samesite=lax` will probably not break the user experience and add protection.\n\nOverall, `samesite` is a great option, but it has an important drawback:\n- `samesite` is ignored (not supported) by old browsers, year 2017 or so.\n\n**So if we solely rely on `samesite` to provide protection, then old browsers will be vulnerable.**\n\nBut we surely can use `samesite` together with other protection measures, like xsrf tokens, to add an additional layer of defence and then, in the future, when old browsers die out, we'll probably be able to drop xsrf tokens.\n\n## httpOnly\n\nThis option has nothing to do with JavaScript, but we have to mention it for completeness.\n\nThe web-server uses `Set-Cookie` header to set a cookie. And it may set the `httpOnly` option.\n\nThis option forbids any JavaScript access to the cookie. We can't see such cookie or manipulate it using `document.cookie`.\n\nThat's used as a precaution measure, to protect from certain attacks when a hacker injects his own JavaScript code into a page and waits for a user to visit that page. That shouldn't be possible at all, a hacker should not be able to inject their code into our site, but there may be bugs that let hackers do it.\n\n\nNormally, if such thing happens, and a user visits a web-page with hacker's JavaScript code, then that code executes and gains access to `document.cookie` with user cookies containing authentication information. That's bad.\n\nBut if a cookie is `httpOnly`, then `document.cookie` doesn't see it, so it is protected.\n\n## Appendix: Cookie functions\n\nHere's a small set of functions to work with cookies, more convenient than a manual modification of `document.cookie`.\n\nThere exist many cookie libraries for that, so these are for demo purposes. Fully working though.\n\n\n### getCookie(name)\n\nThe shortest way to access cookie is to use a [regular expression](info:regular-expressions).\n\nThe function `getCookie(name)` returns the cookie with the given `name`:\n\n```js\n// returns the cookie with the given name,\n// or undefined if not found\nfunction getCookie(name) {\n  let matches = document.cookie.match(new RegExp(\n    \"(?:^|; )\" + name.replace(/([\\.$?*|{}\\(\\)\\[\\]\\\\\\/\\+^])/g, '\\\\$1') + \"=([^;]*)\"\n  ));\n  return matches ? decodeURIComponent(matches[1]) : undefined;\n}\n```\n\nHere `new RegExp` is generated dynamically, to match `; name=<value>`.\n\nPlease note that a cookie value is encoded, so `getCookie` uses a built-in `decodeURIComponent` function to decode it.\n\n### setCookie(name, value, options)\n\nSets the cookie `name` to the given `value` with `path=/` by default (can be modified to add other defaults):\n\n```js run\nfunction setCookie(name, value, options = {}) {\n\n  options = {\n    path: '/',\n    // add other defaults here if necessary\n    ...options\n  };\n\n  if (options.expires instanceof Date) {\n    options.expires = options.expires.toUTCString();\n  }\n\n  let updatedCookie = encodeURIComponent(name) + \"=\" + encodeURIComponent(value);\n\n  for (let optionKey in options) {\n    updatedCookie += \"; \" + optionKey;\n    let optionValue = options[optionKey];\n    if (optionValue !== true) {\n      updatedCookie += \"=\" + optionValue;\n    }\n  }\n\n  document.cookie = updatedCookie;\n}\n\n// Example of use:\nsetCookie('user', 'John', {secure: true, 'max-age': 3600});\n```\n\n### deleteCookie(name)\n\nTo delete a cookie, we can call it with a negative expiration date:\n\n```js\nfunction deleteCookie(name) {\n  setCookie(name, \"\", {\n    'max-age': -1\n  })\n}\n```\n\n```warn header=\"Updating or deleting must use same path and domain\"\nPlease note: when we update or delete a cookie, we should use exactly the same path and domain options as when we set it.\n```\n\nTogether: [cookie.js](cookie.js).\n\n\n## Appendix: Third-party cookies\n\nA cookie is called \"third-party\" if it's placed by domain other than the page user is visiting.\n\nFor instance:\n1. A page at `site.com` loads a banner from another site: `<img src=\"https://ads.com/banner.png\">`.\n2. Along with the banner, the remote server at `ads.com` may set `Set-Cookie` header with cookie like `id=1234`. Such cookie originates from `ads.com` domain, and will only be visible at `ads.com`:\n\n    ![](cookie-third-party.svg)\n\n3. Next time when `ads.com` is accessed, the remote server gets the `id` cookie and recognizes the user:\n\n    ![](cookie-third-party-2.svg)\n\n4. What's even more important, when the users moves from `site.com` to another site `other.com` that also has a banner, then `ads.com` gets the cookie, as it belongs to `ads.com`, thus recognizing the visitor and tracking him as he moves between sites:\n\n    ![](cookie-third-party-3.svg)\n\n\nThird-party cookies are traditionally used for tracking and ads services, due to their nature. They are bound to the originating domain, so `ads.com` can track the same user between different sites, if they all access it.\n\nNaturally, some people don't like being tracked, so browsers allow to disable such cookies.\n\nAlso, some modern browsers employ special policies for such cookies:\n- Safari does not allow third-party cookies at all.\n- Firefox comes with a \"black list\" of third-party domains where it blocks third-party cookies.\n\n\n```smart\nIf we load a script from a third-party domain, like `<script src=\"https://google-analytics.com/analytics.js\">`, and that script uses `document.cookie` to set a cookie, then such cookie is not third-party.\n\nIf a script sets a cookie, then no matter where the script came from -- the cookie belongs to the domain of the current webpage.\n```\n\n## Appendix: GDPR\n\nThis topic is not related to JavaScript at all, just something to keep in mind when setting cookies.\n\nThere's a legislation in Europe called GDPR, that enforces a set of rules for websites to respect users' privacy. And one of such rules is to require an explicit permission for tracking cookies from a user.\n\nPlease note, that's only about tracking/identifying/authorizing cookies.\n\nSo, if we set a cookie that just saves some information, but neither tracks nor identifies the user, then we are free to do it.\n\nBut if we are going to set a cookie with an authentication session or a tracking id, then a user must allow that.\n\nWebsites generally have two variants of following GDPR. You must have seen them both already in the web:\n\n1. If a website wants to set tracking cookies only for authenticated users.\n\n    To do so, the registration form should have a checkbox like \"accept the privacy policy\" (that describes how cookies are used), the user must check it, and then the website is free to set auth cookies.\n\n2. If a website wants to set tracking cookies for everyone.\n\n    To do so legally, a website shows a modal \"splash screen\" for newcomers, and require them to agree for cookies. Then the website can set them and let people see the content. That can be disturbing for new visitors though. No one likes to see \"must-click\" modal splash screens instead of the content. But GDPR requires an explicit agreement.\n\n\nGDPR is not only about cookies, it's about other privacy-related issues too, but that's too much beyond our scope.\n\n\n## Summary\n\n`document.cookie` provides access to cookies\n- write operations modify only cookies mentioned in it.\n- name/value must be encoded.\n- one cookie up to 4kb, 20+ cookies per site (depends on a browser).\n\nCookie options:\n- `path=/`, by default current path, makes the cookie visible only under that path.\n- `domain=site.com`, by default a cookie is visible on current domain only, if set explicitly to the domain, makes the cookie visible on subdomains.\n- `expires` or `max-age` sets cookie expiration time, without them the cookie dies when the browser is closed.\n- `secure` makes the cookie HTTPS-only.\n- `samesite` forbids the browser to send the cookie with requests coming from outside the site, helps to prevent XSRF attacks.\n\nAdditionally:\n- Third-party cookies may be forbidden by the browser, e.g. Safari does that by default.\n- When setting a tracking cookie for EU citizens, GDPR requires to ask for permission.",

        "content": "\n\nWeb storage objects `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` allow to save key/value pairs in the browser.\n\nWhat's interesting about them is that the data survives a page refresh (for `sessionStorage`) and even a full browser restart (for `localStorage`). We'll see that very soon.\n\nWe already have cookies. Why additional objects?\n\n- Unlike cookies, web storage objects are not sent to server with each request. Because of that, we can store much more. Most browsers allow at least 2 megabytes of data (or more) and have settings to configure that.\n- Also unlike cookies, the server can't manipulate storage objects via HTTP headers. Everything's done in JavaScript.\n- The storage is bound to the origin (domain/protocol/port triplet). That is, different protocols or subdomains infer different storage objects, they can't access data from each other.\n\nBoth storage objects provide same methods and properties:\n\n- `setItem(key, value)` -- store key/value pair.\n- `getItem(key)` -- get the value by key.\n- `removeItem(key)` -- remove the key with its value.\n- `clear()` -- delete everything.\n- `key(index)` -- get the key on a given position.\n- `length` -- the number of stored items.\n\nAs you can see, it's like a `Map` collection (`setItem/getItem/removeItem`), but also allows access by index with `key(index)`.\n\nLet's see how it works.\n\n## localStorage demo\n\nThe main features of `localStorage` are:\n\n- Shared between all tabs and windows from the same origin.\n- The data does not expire. It remains after the browser restart and even OS reboot.\n\nFor instance, if you run this code...\n\n```js run\nlocalStorage.setItem('test', 1);\n```\n\n...And close/open the browser or just open the same page in a different window, then you can get it like this:\n\n```js run\nalert( localStorage.getItem('test') ); // 1\n```\n\nWe only have to be on the same origin (domain/port/protocol), the url path can be different.\n\nThe `localStorage` is shared between all windows with the same origin, so if we set the data in one window, the change becomes visible in another one.\n\n## Object-like access\n\nWe can also use a plain object way of getting/setting keys, like this:\n\n```js run\n// set key\nlocalStorage.test = 2;\n\n// get key\nalert( localStorage.test ); // 2\n\n// remove key\ndelete localStorage.test;\n```\n\nThat's allowed for historical reasons, and mostly works, but generally not recommended, because:\n\n1. If the key is user-generated, it can be anything, like `length` or `toString`, or another built-in method of `localStorage`. In that case `getItem/setItem` work fine, while object-like access fails:\n    ```js run\n    let key = 'length';\n    localStorage[key] = 5; // Error, can't assign length\n    ```\n\n2. There's a `storage` event, it triggers when we modify the data. That event does not happen for object-like access. We'll see that later in this chapter.\n\n## Looping over keys\n\nAs we've seen, the methods provide \"get/set/remove by key\" functionality. But how to get all saved values or keys?\n\nUnfortunately, storage objects are not iterable.\n\nOne way is to loop over them as over an array:\n\n```js run\nfor(let i=0; i<localStorage.length; i++) {\n  let key = localStorage.key(i);\n  alert(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);\n}\n```\n\nAnother way is to use `for key in localStorage` loop, just as we do with regular objects.\n\nIt iterates over keys, but also outputs few built-in fields that we don't need:\n\n```js run\n// bad try\nfor(let key in localStorage) {\n  alert(key); // shows getItem, setItem and other built-in stuff\n}\n```\n\n...So we need either to filter fields from the prototype with `hasOwnProperty` check:\n\n```js run\nfor(let key in localStorage) {\n  if (!localStorage.hasOwnProperty(key)) {\n    continue; // skip keys like \"setItem\", \"getItem\" etc\n  }\n  alert(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);\n}\n```\n\n...Or just get the \"own\" keys with `Object.keys` and then loop over them if needed:\n\n```js run\nlet keys = Object.keys(localStorage);\nfor(let key of keys) {\n  alert(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);\n}\n```\n\nThe latter works, because `Object.keys` only returns the keys that belong to the object, ignoring the prototype.\n\n\n## Strings only\n\nPlease note that both key and value must be strings.\n\nIf were any other type, like a number, or an object, it gets converted to string automatically:\n\n```js run\nsessionStorage.user = {name: \"John\"};\nalert(sessionStorage.user); // [object Object]\n```\n\nWe can use `JSON` to store objects though:\n\n```js run\nsessionStorage.user = JSON.stringify({name: \"John\"});\n\n// sometime later\nlet user = JSON.parse( sessionStorage.user );\nalert( user.name ); // John\n```\n\nAlso it is possible to stringify the whole storage object, e.g. for debugging purposes:\n\n```js run\n// added formatting options to JSON.stringify to make the object look nicer\nalert( JSON.stringify(localStorage, null, 2) );\n```\n\n\n## sessionStorage\n\nThe `sessionStorage` object is used much less often than `localStorage`.\n\nProperties and methods are the same, but it's much more limited:\n\n- The `sessionStorage` exists only within the current browser tab.\n  - Another tab with the same page will have a different storage.\n  - But it is shared between iframes in the same tab (assuming they come from the same origin).\n- The data survives page refresh, but not closing/opening the tab.\n\nLet's see that in action.\n\nRun this code...\n\n```js run\nsessionStorage.setItem('test', 1);\n```\n\n...Then refresh the page. Now you can still get the data:\n\n```js run\nalert( sessionStorage.getItem('test') ); // after refresh: 1\n```\n\n...But if you open the same page in another tab, and try again there, the code above returns `null`, meaning \"nothing found\".\n\nThat's exactly because `sessionStorage` is bound not only to the origin, but also to the browser tab. For that reason, `sessionStorage` is used sparingly.\n\n## Storage event\n\nWhen the data gets updated in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`, [storage](https://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/#the-storage-event) event triggers, with properties:\n\n- `key` – the key that was changed (`null` if `.clear()` is called).\n- `oldValue` – the old value (`null` if the key is newly added).\n- `newValue` – the new value (`null` if the key is removed).\n- `url` – the url of the document where the update happened.\n- `storageArea` – either `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` object where the update happened.\n\nThe important thing is: the event triggers on all `window` objects where the storage is accessible, except the one that caused it.\n\nLet's elaborate.\n\nImagine, you have two windows with the same site in each. So `localStorage` is shared between them.\n\n```online\nYou might want to open this page in two browser windows to test the code below.\n```\n\nIf both windows are listening for `window.onstorage`, then each one will react on updates that happened in the other one.\n\n```js run\n// triggers on updates made to the same storage from other documents\nwindow.onstorage = event => { // same as window.addEventListener('storage', () => {\n  if (event.key != 'now') return;\n  alert(event.key + ':' + event.newValue + \" at \" + event.url);\n};\n\nlocalStorage.setItem('now', Date.now());\n```\n\nPlease note that the event also contains: `event.url` -- the url of the document where the data was updated.\n\nAlso, `event.storageArea` contains the storage object -- the event is the same for both `sessionStorage` and `localStorage`, so `event.storageArea` references the one that was modified. We may even want to set something back in it, to \"respond\" to a change.\n\n**That allows different windows from the same origin to exchange messages.**\n\nModern browsers also support [Broadcast channel API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API), the special API for same-origin inter-window communication, it's more full featured, but less supported. There are libraries that polyfill that API, based on `localStorage`, that make it available everywhere.\n\n## Summary\n\nWeb storage objects `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` allow to store key/value in the browser.\n- Both `key` and `value` must be strings.\n- The limit is 2mb+, depends on the browser.\n- They do not expire.\n- The data is bound to the origin (domain/port/protocol).\n\n| `localStorage` | `sessionStorage` |\n|----------------|------------------|\n| Shared between all tabs and windows with the same origin | Visible within a browser tab, including iframes from the same origin |\n| Survives browser restart | Survives page refresh (but not tab close) |\n\nAPI:\n\n- `setItem(key, value)` -- store key/value pair.\n- `getItem(key)` -- get the value by key.\n- `removeItem(key)` -- remove the key with its value.\n- `clear()` -- delete everything.\n- `key(index)` -- get the key number `index`.\n- `length` -- the number of stored items.\n- Use `Object.keys` to get all keys.\n- We access keys as object properties, in that case `storage` event isn't triggered.\n\nStorage event:\n\n- Triggers on `setItem`, `removeItem`, `clear` calls.\n- Contains all the data about the operation (`key/oldValue/newValue`), the document `url` and the storage object `storageArea`.\n- Triggers on all `window` objects that have access to the storage except the one that generated it (within a tab for `sessionStorage`, globally for `localStorage`).",

        "content": "\n\nIndexedDB is a database that is built into browser, much more powerful than `localStorage`.\n\n- Stores almost any kind of values by keys, multiple key types.\n- Supports transactions for reliability.\n- Supports key range queries, indexes.\n- Can store much bigger volumes of data than `localStorage`.\n\nThat power is usually excessive for traditional client-server apps. IndexedDB is intended for offline apps, to be combined with ServiceWorkers and other technologies.\n\nThe native interface to IndexedDB, described in the specification <https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB>, is event-based.\n\nWe can also use `async/await` with the help of a promise-based wrapper, like <https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb>. That's pretty convenient, but the wrapper is not perfect, it can't replace events for all cases. So we'll start with events, and then, after we gain understanding of IndexedDb, we'll use the wrapper.\n\n## Open database\n\nTo start working with IndexedDB, we first need to `open` (connect to) a database.\n\nThe syntax:\n\n```js\nlet openRequest = indexedDB.open(name, version);\n```\n\n- `name` -- a string, the database name.\n- `version` -- a positive integer version, by default `1` (explained below).\n\nWe can have many databases with different names, but all of them exist within the current origin (domain/protocol/port). Different websites can't access databases of each other.\n\nThe call returns `openRequest` object, we should listen to events on it:\n- `success`: database is ready, there's the \"database object\" in `openRequest.result`, that we should use it for further calls.\n- `error`: opening failed.\n- `upgradeneeded`: database is ready, but its version is outdated (see below).\n\n**IndexedDB has a built-in mechanism of \"schema versioning\", absent in server-side databases.**\n\nUnlike server-side databases, IndexedDB is client-side, the data is stored in the browser, so we, developers, don't have \"any time\" access to it. So, when we published a new version of our app, and the user visits our webpage, we may need to update the database.\n\nIf the local database version is less than specified in `open`, then a special event `upgradeneeded` is triggered, and we can compare versions and upgrade data structures as needed.\n\nThe `upgradeneeded` event also triggers when the database did not exist yet (technically, it's version is `0`), so we can perform initialization.\n\nLet's say we published the first version of our app.\n\nThen we can open the database with version `1` and perform the initialization in `upgradeneeded` handler like this:\n\n```js\nlet openRequest = indexedDB.open(\"store\", *!*1*/!*);\n\nopenRequest.onupgradeneeded = function() {\n  // triggers if the client had no database\n  // ...perform initialization...\n};\n\nopenRequest.onerror = function() {\n  console.error(\"Error\", openRequest.error);\n};\n\nopenRequest.onsuccess = function() {\n  let db = openRequest.result;\n  // continue to work with database using db object\n};\n```\n\nThen, later, we publish the 2nd version.\n\nWe can open it with version `2` and perform the upgrade like this:\n\n```js\nlet openRequest = indexedDB.open(\"store\", *!*2*/!*);\n\nopenRequest.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {\n  // the existing database version is less than 2 (or it doesn't exist)\n  let db = openRequest.result;\n  switch(event.oldVersion) { // existing db version\n    case 0:\n      // version 0 means that the client had no database\n      // perform initialization\n    case 1:\n      // client had version 1\n      // update\n  }\n};\n```\n\nPlease note: as our current version is `2`, `onupgradeneeded` handler has a code branch for version `0`, suitable for users that come for the first time and have no database, and also for version `1`, for upgrades.\n\nAnd then, only if `onupgradeneeded` handler finishes without errors, `openRequest.onsuccess` triggers, and the database is considered successfully opened.\n\nTo delete a database:\n\n```js\nlet deleteRequest = indexedDB.deleteDatabase(name)\n// deleteRequest.onsuccess/onerror tracks the result\n```\n\n```warn header=\"We can't open an older version of the database\"\nIf the current user database has a higher version than in the `open` call, e.g. the existing DB version is `3`, and we try to `open(...2)`, then that's an error, `openRequest.onerror` triggers.\n\nThat's odd, but such thing may happen when a visitor loaded an outdated JavaScript code, e.g. from a proxy cache. So the code is old, but his database is new.\n\nTo protect from errors, we should check `db.version` and suggest him to reload the page. Use proper HTTP caching headers to avoid loading the old code, so that you'll never have such problem.\n```\n\n### Parallel update problem\n\nAs we're talking about versioning, let's tackle a small related problem.\n\nLet's say:\n1. A visitor opened our site in a browser tab, with database version `1`.\n2. Then we rolled out an update, so our code is newer.\n3. And then the same visitor opens our site in another tab.\n\nSo there's a tab with an open connection to DB version `1`, while the second tab one attempts to update it to version `2` in its `upgradeneeded` handler.\n\nThe problem is that a database is shared between two tabs, as it's the same site, same origin. And it can't be both version `1` and `2`. To perform the update to version `2`, all connections to version 1 must be closed, including the one in the first tab.\n\nIn order to organize that, the `versionchange` event triggers in such case on the \"outdated\" database object. We should listen to it and close the old database connection (and probably suggest the visitor to reload the page, to load the updated code).\n\nIf we don't listen to `versionchange` event and don't close the old connection, then the second, new connection won't be made. The `openRequest` object will emit the `blocked` event instead of `success`. So the second tab won't work.\n\nHere's the code to correctly handle the parallel upgrade.\n\nIt installs `onversionchange` handler after the database is opened, that closes the old connection:\n\n```js\nlet openRequest = indexedDB.open(\"store\", 2);\n\nopenRequest.onupgradeneeded = ...;\nopenRequest.onerror = ...;\n\nopenRequest.onsuccess = function() {\n  let db = openRequest.result;\n\n  *!*\n  db.onversionchange = function() {\n    db.close();\n    alert(\"Database is outdated, please reload the page.\")\n  };\n  */!*\n\n  // ...the db is ready, use it...\n};\n\n*!*\nopenRequest.onblocked = function() {\n  // this event shouldn't trigger if we handle onversionchange correctly\n\n  // it means that there's another open connection to same database\n  // and it wasn't closed after db.onversionchange triggered for them\n};\n*/!*\n```\n\nHere we do two things:\n\n1. Add `db.onversionchange` listener after a successful opening, to be informed about a parallel update attempt.\n2. Add `openRequest.onblocked` listener to handle the case when an old connection wasn't closed. This doesn't happen if we close it in `db.onversionchange`.\n\nThere are other variants. For example, we can take time to close things gracefully in `db.onversionchange`, prompt the visitor to save the data before the connection is closed. The new updating connection will be blocked immediatelly after `db.onversionchange` finished without closing, and we can ask the visitor in the new tab to close other tabs for the update.\n\nSuch update collision happens rarely, but we should at least have some handling for it, e.g. `onblocked` handler, so that our script doesn't surprise the user by dying silently.\n\n## Object store\n\nTo store something in IndexedDB, we need an *object store*.\n\nAn object store is a core concept of IndexedDB. Counterparts in other databases are called \"tables\" or \"collections\". It's where the data is stored. A database may have multiple stores: one for users, another one for goods, etc.\n\nDespite being named an \"object store\", primitives can be stored too.\n\n**We can store almost any value, including complex objects.**\n\nIndexedDB uses the [standard serialization algorithm](https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/infrastructure.html#section-structuredserializeforstorage) to clone-and-store an object. It's like `JSON.stringify`, but more powerful, capable of storing much more datatypes.\n\nAn example of object that can't be stored: an object with circular references. Such objects are not serializable. `JSON.stringify` also fails for such objects.\n\n**There must be a unique `key` for every value in the store.**     \n\nA key must have a type one of: number, date, string, binary, or array. It's an unique identifier: we can search/remove/update values by the key.\n\n![](indexeddb-structure.svg)\n\n\nAs we'll see very soon, we can provide a key when we add a value to the store, similar to `localStorage`. But when we store objects, IndexedDB allows to setup an object property as the key, that's much more convenient. Or we can auto-generate keys.\n\nBut we need to create an object store first.\n\n\nThe syntax to create an object store:\n```js\ndb.createObjectStore(name[, keyOptions]);\n```\n\nPlease note, the operation is synchronous, no `await` needed.\n\n- `name` is the store name, e.g. `\"books\"` for books,\n- `keyOptions` is an optional object with one of two properties:\n  - `keyPath` -- a path to an object property that IndexedDB will use as the key, e.g. `id`.\n  - `autoIncrement` -- if `true`, then the key for a newly stored object is generated automatically, as an ever-incrementing number.\n\nIf we don't supply `keyOptions`, then we'll need to provide a key explicitly later, when storing an object.\n\nFor instance, this object store uses `id` property as the key:\n```js\ndb.createObjectStore('books', {keyPath: 'id'});\n```\n\n**An object store can only be created/modified while updating the DB version, in `upgradeneeded` handler.**\n\nThat's a technical limitation. Outside of the handler we'll be able to add/remove/update the data, but object stores can be created/removed/altered only during version update.\n\nTo perform database version upgrade, there are two main approaches:\n1. We can implement per-version upgrade functions: from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, from 3 to 4 etc. Then, in `upgradeneeded` we can compare versions (e.g. old 2, now 4) and run per-version upgrades step by step, for every intermediate version (2 to 3, then 3 to 4).\n2. Or we can just examine the database: get a list of existing object stores as `db.objectStoreNames`. That object is a [DOMStringList](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-dom-interfaces.html#domstringlist) that provides `contains(name)` method to check for existance. And then we can do updates depending on what exists and what doesn't.\n\nFor small databases the second variant may be simpler.\n\nHere's the demo of the second approach:\n\n```js\nlet openRequest = indexedDB.open(\"db\", 2);\n\n// create/upgrade the database without version checks\nopenRequest.onupgradeneeded = function() {\n  let db = openRequest.result;\n  if (!db.objectStoreNames.contains('books')) { // if there's no \"books\" store\n    db.createObjectStore('books', {keyPath: 'id'}); // create it\n  }\n};\n```\n\n\nTo delete an object store:\n\n```js\ndb.deleteObjectStore('books')\n```\n\n## Transactions\n\nThe term \"transaction\" is generic, used in many kinds of databases.\n\nA transaction is a group operations, that should either all succeed or all fail.\n\nFor instance, when a person buys something, we need:\n1. Subtract the money from their account.\n2. Add the item to their inventory.\n\nIt would be pretty bad if we complete the 1st operation, and then something goes wrong, e.g. lights out, and we fail to do the 2nd. Both should either succeed (purchase complete, good!) or both fail (at least the person kept their money, so they can retry).\n\nTransactions can guarantee that.\n\n**All data operations must be made within a transaction in IndexedDB.**\n\nTo start a transaction:\n\n```js run\ndb.transaction(store[, type]);\n```\n\n- `store` is a store name that the transaction is going to access, e.g. `\"books\"`. Can be an array of store names if we're going to access multiple stores.\n- `type` – a transaction type, one of:\n  - `readonly` -- can only read, the default.\n  - `readwrite` -- can only read and write the data, but not create/remove/alter object stores.\n\nThere's also `versionchange` transaction type: such transactions can do everything, but we can't create them manually. IndexedDB automatically creates a `versionchange` transaction when opening the database, for `updateneeded` handler. That's why it's a single place where we can update the database structure, create/remove object stores.\n\n```smart header=\"Why there exist different types of transactions?\"\nPerformance is the reason why transactions need to be labeled either `readonly` and `readwrite`.\n\nMany `readonly` transactions are able to access concurrently the same store, but `readwrite` transactions can't. A `readwrite` transaction \"locks\" the store for writing. The next transaction must wait before the previous one finishes before accessing the same store.\n```\n\nAfter the transaction is created, we can add an item to the store, like this:\n\n```js\nlet transaction = db.transaction(\"books\", \"readwrite\"); // (1)\n\n// get an object store to operate on it\n*!*\nlet books = transaction.objectStore(\"books\"); // (2)\n*/!*\n\nlet book = {\n  id: 'js',\n  price: 10,\n  created: new Date()\n};\n\n*!*\nlet request = books.add(book); // (3)\n*/!*\n\nrequest.onsuccess = function() { // (4)\n  console.log(\"Book added to the store\", request.result);\n};\n\nrequest.onerror = function() {\n  console.log(\"Error\", request.error);\n};\n```\n\nThere were basically four steps:\n\n1. Create a transaction, mention all stores it's going to access, at `(1)`.\n2. Get the store object using `transaction.objectStore(name)`, at `(2)`.\n3. Perform the request to the object store `books.add(book)`, at `(3)`.\n4. ...Handle request success/error `(4)`, then we can make other requests if needed, etc.\n\nObject stores support two methods to store a value:\n\n- **put(value, [key])**\n    Add the `value` to the store. The `key` is supplied only if the object store did not have `keyPath` or `autoIncrement` option. If there's already a value with same key, it will be replaced.\n\n- **add(value, [key])**\n    Same as `put`, but if there's already a value with the same key, then the request fails, and an error with the name `\"ConstraintError\"` is generated.\n\nSimilar to opening a database, we can send a request: `books.add(book)`, and then wait for `success/error` events.\n\n- The `request.result` for `add` is the key of the new object.\n- The error is in `request.error` (if any).\n\n## Transactions' autocommit\n\nIn the example above we started the transaction and made `add` request. But as we stated previously, a transaction may have multiple associated requests, that must either all success or all fail. How do we mark the transaction as finished, no more requests to come?\n\nThe short answer is: we don't.\n\nIn the next version 3.0 of the specification, there will probably be a manual way to finish the transaction, but right now in 2.0 there isn't.\n\n**When all transaction requests are finished, and the [microtasks queue](info:microtask-queue) is empty, it is committed automatically.**\n\nUsually, we can assume that a transaction commits when all its requests are complete, and the current code finishes.\n\nSo, in the example above no special call is needed to finish the transaction.\n\nTransactions auto-commit principle has an important side effect. We can't insert an async operation like `fetch`, `setTimeout` in the middle of transaction. IndexedDB will not keep the transaction waiting till these are done.\n\nIn the code below `request2` in line `(*)` fails, because the transaction is already committed, can't make any request in it:\n\n```js\nlet request1 = books.add(book);\n\nrequest1.onsuccess = function() {\n  fetch('/').then(response => {\n*!*\n    let request2 = books.add(anotherBook); // (*)\n*/!*\n    request2.onerror = function() {\n      console.log(request2.error.name); // TransactionInactiveError\n    };\n  });\n};\n```\n\nThat's because `fetch` is an asynchronous operation, a macrotask. Transactions are closed before the browser starts doing macrotasks.\n\nAuthors of IndexedDB spec believe that transactions should be short-lived. Mostly for performance reasons.\n\nNotably, `readwrite` transactions \"lock\" the stores for writing. So if one part of application initiated `readwrite` on `books` object store, then another part that wants to do the same has to wait: the new transaction \"hangs\" till the first one is done. That can lead to strange delays if transactions take a long time.\n\nSo, what to do?\n\nIn the example above we could make a new `db.transaction` right before the new request `(*)`.\n\nBut it will be even better, if we'd like to keep the operations together, in one transaction, to split apart IndexedDB transactions and \"other\" async stuff.\n\nFirst, make `fetch`, prepare the data if needed, afterwards create a transaction and perform all the database requests, it'll work then.\n\nTo detect the moment of successful completion, we can listen to `transaction.oncomplete` event:\n\n```js\nlet transaction = db.transaction(\"books\", \"readwrite\");\n\n// ...perform operations...\n\ntransaction.oncomplete = function() {\n  console.log(\"Transaction is complete\");\n};\n```\n\nOnly `complete` guarantees that the transaction is saved as a whole. Individual requests may succeed, but the final write operation may go wrong (e.g. I/O error or something).\n\nTo manually abort the transaction, call:\n\n```js\ntransaction.abort();\n```\n\nThat cancels all modification made by the requests in it and triggers `transaction.onabort` event.\n\n\n## Error handling\n\nWrite requests may fail.\n\nThat's to be expected, not only because of possible errors at our side, but also for reasons not related to the transaction itself. For instance, the storage quota may be exceeded. So we must be ready to handle such case.\n\n**A failed request automatically aborts the transaction, canceling all its changes.**\n\nIn some situations, we may want to handle the failure (e.g. try another request), without canceling existing changes, and continue the transaction. That's possible. The `request.onerror` handler is able to prevent the transaction abort by calling `event.preventDefault()`.\n\nIn the example below a new book is added with the same key (`id`) as the existing one. The `store.add` method generates a `\"ConstraintError\"` in that case. We handle it without canceling the transaction:\n\n```js\nlet transaction = db.transaction(\"books\", \"readwrite\");\n\nlet book = { id: 'js', price: 10 };\n\nlet request = transaction.objectStore(\"books\").add(book);\n\nrequest.onerror = function(event) {\n  // ConstraintError occurs when an object with the same id already exists\n  if (request.error.name == \"ConstraintError\") {\n    console.log(\"Book with such id already exists\"); // handle the error\n    event.preventDefault(); // don't abort the transaction\n    // use another key for the book?\n  } else {\n    // unexpected error, can't handle it\n    // the transaction will abort\n  }\n};\n\ntransaction.onabort = function() {\n  console.log(\"Error\", transaction.error);\n};\n```\n\n### Event delegation\n\nDo we need onerror/onsuccess for every request? Not every time. We can use event delegation instead.\n\n**IndexedDB events bubble: `request` -> `transaction` -> `database`.**\n\nAll events are DOM events, with capturing and bubbling, but usually only bubbling stage is used.\n\nSo we can catch all errors using `db.onerror` handler, for reporting or other purposes:\n\n```js\ndb.onerror = function(event) {\n  let request = event.target; // the request that caused the error\n\n  console.log(\"Error\", request.error);\n};\n```\n\n...But what if an error is fully handled? We don't want to report it in that case.\n\nWe can stop the bubbling and hence `db.onerror` by using `event.stopPropagation()` in `request.onerror`.\n\n```js\nrequest.onerror = function(event) {\n  if (request.error.name == \"ConstraintError\") {\n    console.log(\"Book with such id already exists\"); // handle the error\n    event.preventDefault(); // don't abort the transaction\n    event.stopPropagation(); // don't bubble error up, \"chew\" it\n  } else {\n    // do nothing\n    // transaction will be aborted\n    // we can take care of error in transaction.onabort\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Searching by keys\n\nThere are two main types of search in an object store:\n1. By a key or a key range. That is: by `book.id` in our \"books\" storage.\n2. By another object field, e.g. `book.price`.\n\nFirst let's deal with the keys and key ranges `(1)`.\n\nMethods that involve searching support either exact keys or so-called \"range queries\" -- [IDBKeyRange](https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#keyrange) objects that specify a \"key range\".\n\nRanges are created using following calls:\n\n- `IDBKeyRange.lowerBound(lower, [open])` means: `≥lower` (or `>lower` if `open` is true)\n- `IDBKeyRange.upperBound(upper, [open])` means: `≤upper` (or `<upper` if `open` is true)\n- `IDBKeyRange.bound(lower, upper, [lowerOpen], [upperOpen])` means: between `lower` and `upper`. If the open flags is true, the corresponding key is not included in the range.\n- `IDBKeyRange.only(key)` -- a range that consists of only one `key`, rarely used.\n\nAll searching methods accept a `query` argument that can be either an exact key or a key range:\n\n- `store.get(query)` -- search for the first value by a key or a range.\n- `store.getAll([query], [count])` -- search for all values, limit by `count` if given.\n- `store.getKey(query)` -- search for the first key that satisfies the query, usually a range.\n- `store.getAllKeys([query], [count])` -- search for all keys that satisfy the query, usually a range, up to `count` if given.\n- `store.count([query])` -- get the total count of keys that satisfy the query, usually a range.\n\nFor instance, we have a lot of books in our store. Remember, the `id` field is the key, so all these methods can search by `id`.\n\nRequest examples:\n\n```js\n// get one book\nbooks.get('js')\n\n// get books with 'css' <= id <= 'html'\nbooks.getAll(IDBKeyRange.bound('css', 'html'))\n\n// get books with id < 'html'\nbooks.getAll(IDBKeyRange.upperBound('html', true))\n\n// get all books\nbooks.getAll()\n\n// get all keys: id > 'js'\nbooks.getAllKeys(IDBKeyRange.lowerBound('js', true))\n```\n\n```smart header=\"Object store is always sorted\"\nObject store sorts values by key internally.\n\nSo requests that return many values always return them in sorted by key order.\n```\n\n\n## Searching by any field with an index\n\nTo search by other object fields, we need to create an additional data structure named \"index\".\n\nAn index is an \"add-on\" to the store that tracks a given object field. For each value of that field, it stores a list of keys for objects that have that value. There will be a more detailed picture below.\n\nThe syntax:\n\n```js\nobjectStore.createIndex(name, keyPath, [options]);\n```\n\n- **`name`** -- index name,\n- **`keyPath`** -- path to the object field that the index should track (we're going to search by that field),\n- **`option`** -- an optional object with properties:\n  - **`unique`** -- if true, then there may be only one object in the store with the given value at the `keyPath`. The index will enforce that by generating an error if we try to add a duplicate.\n  - **`multiEntry`** -- only used if the value on `keyPath` is an array. In that case, by default, the index will treat the whole array as the key. But if `multiEntry` is true, then the index will keep a list of store objects for each value in that array. So array members become index keys.\n\nIn our example, we store books keyed by `id`.\n\nLet's say we want to search by `price`.\n\nFirst, we need to create an index. It must be done in `upgradeneeded`, just like an object store:\n\n```js\nopenRequest.onupgradeneeded = function() {\n  // we must create the index here, in versionchange transaction\n  let books = db.createObjectStore('books', {keyPath: 'id'});\n*!*\n  let index = inventory.createIndex('price_idx', 'price');\n*/!*\n};\n```\n\n- The index will track `price` field.\n- The price is not unique, there may be multiple books with the same price, so we don't set `unique` option.\n- The price is not an array, so `multiEntry` flag is not applicable.\n\nImagine that our `inventory` has 4 books. Here's the picture that shows exactly what the `index` is:\n\n![](indexeddb-index.svg)\n\nAs said, the index for each value of `price` (second argument) keeps the list of keys that have that price.\n\nThe index keeps itself up to date automatically, we don't have to care about it.\n\nNow, when we want to search for a given price, we simply apply the same search methods to the index:\n\n```js\nlet transaction = db.transaction(\"books\"); // readonly\nlet books = transaction.objectStore(\"books\");\nlet priceIndex = books.index(\"price_idx\");\n\n*!*\nlet request = priceIndex.getAll(10);\n*/!*\n\nrequest.onsuccess = function() {\n  if (request.result !== undefined) {\n    console.log(\"Books\", request.result); // array of books with price=10\n  } else {\n    console.log(\"No such books\");\n  }\n};\n```\n\nWe can also use `IDBKeyRange` to create ranges and looks for cheap/expensive books:\n\n```js\n// find books where price <= 5\nlet request = priceIndex.getAll(IDBKeyRange.upperBound(5));\n```\n\nIndexes are internally sorted by the tracked object field, `price` in our case. So when we do the search, the results are also sorted by `price`.\n\n## Deleting from store\n\nThe `delete` method looks up values to delete by a query, the call format is similar to `getAll`:\n\n- **`delete(query)`** -- delete matching values by query.\n\nFor instance:\n```js\n// delete the book with id='js'\nbooks.delete('js');\n```\n\nIf we'd like to delete books based on a price or another object field, then we should first find the key in the index, and then call `delete`:\n\n```js\n// find the key where price = 5\nlet request = priceIndex.getKey(5);\n\nrequest.onsuccess = function() {\n  let id = request.result;\n  let deleteRequest = books.delete(id);\n};\n```\n\nTo delete everything:\n```js\nbooks.clear(); // clear the storage.\n```\n\n## Cursors\n\nMethods like `getAll/getAllKeys` return an array of keys/values.\n\nBut an object storage can be huge, bigger than the available memory. Then `getAll` will fail to get all records as an array.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nCursors provide the means to work around that.\n\n**A *cursor* is a special object that traverses the object storage, given a query, and returns one key/value at a time, thus saving memory.**\n\nAs an object store is sorted internally by key, a cursor walks the store in key order (ascending by default).\n\nThe syntax:\n```js\n// like getAll, but with a cursor:\nlet request = store.openCursor(query, [direction]);\n\n// to get keys, not values (like getAllKeys): store.openKeyCursor\n```\n\n- **`query`** is a key or a key range, same as for `getAll`.\n- **`direction`** is an optional argument, which order to use:\n  - `\"next\"` -- the default, the cursor walks up from the record with the lowest key.\n  - `\"prev\"` -- the reverse order: down from the record with the biggest key.\n  - `\"nextunique\"`, `\"prevunique\"` -- same as above, but skip records with the same key (only for cursors over indexes, e.g. for multiple books with price=5 only the first one will be returned).\n\n**The main difference of the cursor is that `request.onsuccess` triggers multiple times: once for each result.**\n\nHere's an example of how to use a cursor:\n\n```js\nlet transaction = db.transaction(\"books\");\nlet books = transaction.objectStore(\"books\");\n\nlet request = books.openCursor();\n\n// called for each book found by the cursor\nrequest.onsuccess = function() {\n  let cursor = request.result;\n  if (cursor) {\n    let key = cursor.key; // book key (id field)\n    let value = cursor.value; // book object\n    console.log(key, value);\n    cursor.continue();\n  } else {\n    console.log(\"No more books\");\n  }\n};\n```\n\nThe main cursor methods are:\n\n- `advance(count)` -- advance the cursor `count` times, skipping values.\n- `continue([key])` -- advance the cursor to the next value in range matching (or immediately after `key` if given).\n\nWhether there are more values matching the cursor or not -- `onsuccess` gets called, and then in `result` we can get the cursor pointing to the next record, or `undefined`.\n\nIn the example above the cursor was made for the object store.\n\nBut we also can make a cursor over an index. As we remember, indexes allow to search by an object field. Cursors over indexes to precisely the same as over object stores -- they save memory by returning one value at a time.\n\nFor cursors over indexes, `cursor.key` is the index key (e.g. price), and we should use `cursor.primaryKey` property for the object key:\n\n```js\nlet request = priceIdx.openCursor(IDBKeyRange.upperBound(5));\n\n// called for each record\nrequest.onsuccess = function() {\n  let cursor = request.result;\n  if (cursor) {\n    let key = cursor.primaryKey; // next object store key (id field)\n    let value = cursor.value; // next object store object (book object)\n    let key = cursor.key; // next index key (price)\n    console.log(key, value);\n    cursor.continue();\n  } else {\n    console.log(\"No more books\");\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Promise wrapper\n\nAdding `onsuccess/onerror` to every request is quite a cumbersome task. Sometimes we can make our life easier by using event delegation, e.g. set handlers on the whole transactions, but `async/await` is much more convenient.\n\nLet's use a thin promise wrapper <https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb> further in this chapter. It creates a global `idb` object with [promisified](info:promisify) IndexedDB methods.\n\nThen, instead of `onsuccess/onerror` we can write like this:\n\n```js\nlet db = await idb.openDb('store', 1, db => {\n  if (db.oldVersion == 0) {\n    // perform the initialization\n    db.createObjectStore('books', {keyPath: 'id'});\n  }\n});\n\nlet transaction = db.transaction('books', 'readwrite');\nlet books = transaction.objectStore('books');\n\ntry {\n  await books.add(...);\n  await books.add(...);\n\n  await transaction.complete;\n\n  console.log('jsbook saved');\n} catch(err) {\n  console.log('error', err.message);\n}\n\n```\n\nSo we have all the sweet \"plain async code\" and \"try..catch\" stuff.\n\n### Error handling\n\nIf we don't catch an error, then it falls through, till the closest outer `try..catch`.\n\nAn uncaught error becomes an \"unhandled promise rejection\" event on `window` object.\n\nWe can handle such errors like this:\n\n```js\nwindow.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', event => {\n  let request = event.target; // IndexedDB native request object\n  let error = event.reason; //  Unhandled error object, same as request.error\n  ...report about the error...\n});\n```\n\n### \"Inactive transaction\" pitfall\n\n\nAs we already know, a transaction auto-commits as soon as the browser is done with the current code and microtasks. So if we put a *macrotask* like `fetch` in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction won't wait for it to finish. It just auto-commits. So the next request in it would fail.\n\n\nFor a promise wrapper and `async/await` the situation is the same.\n\nHere's an example of `fetch` in the middle of the transaction:\n\n```js\nlet transaction = db.transaction(\"inventory\", \"readwrite\");\nlet inventory = transaction.objectStore(\"inventory\");\n\nawait inventory.add({ id: 'js', price: 10, created: new Date() });\n\nawait fetch(...); // (*)\n\nawait inventory.add({ id: 'js', price: 10, created: new Date() }); // Error\n```\n\nThe next `inventory.add` after `fetch` `(*)` fails with an \"inactive transaction\" error, because the transaction is already committed and closed at that time.\n\nThe workaround is same as when working with native IndexedDB: either make a new transaction or just split things apart.\n1. Prepare the data and fetch all that's needed first.\n2. Then save in the database.\n\n### Getting native objects\n\nInternally, the wrapper performs a native IndexedDB request, adding `onerror/onsuccess` to it, and returns a promise that rejects/resolves with the result.\n\nThat works fine most of the time. The examples are at the lib page <https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb>.\n\nIn few rare cases, when we need the original `request` object, we can access it as `promise.request` property of the promise:\n\n```js\nlet promise = books.add(book); // get a promise (don't await for its result)\n\nlet request = promise.request; // native request object\nlet transaction = request.transaction; // native transaction object\n\n// ...do some native IndexedDB voodoo...\n\nlet result = await promise; // if still needed\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nIndexedDB can be thought of as a \"localStorage on steroids\". It's a simple key-value database, powerful enough for offline apps, yet simple to use.\n\nThe best manual is the specification, [the current one](https://w3c.github.io/IndexedDB) is 2.0, but few methods from [3.0](https://w3c.github.io/IndexedDB/) (it's not much different) are partially supported.\n\nThe basic usage can be described with a few phrases:\n\n1. Get a promise wrapper like [idb](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb).\n2. Open a database: `idb.openDb(name, version, onupgradeneeded)`\n    - Create object storages and indexes in `onupgradeneeded` handler or perform version update if needed.\n3. For requests:\n    - Create transaction `db.transaction('books')` (readwrite if needed).\n    - Get the object store `transaction.objectStore('books')`.\n4. Then, to search by a key, call methods on the object store directly.\n    - To search by an object field, create an index.\n5. If the data does not fit in memory, use a cursor.\n\nHere's a small demo app:\n\n[codetabs src=\"books\" current=\"index.html\"]",

If convex hulls do not intersect, then curves do not either. So checking for the convex hulls intersection first can give a very fast \"no intersection\" result. Checking the intersection or convex hulls is much easier, because they are rectangles, triangles and so on (see the picture above), much simpler figures than the curve.\n\n**The main value of Bezier curves for drawing -- by moving the points the curve is changing *in intuitively obvious way*.**\n\nTry to move control points using a mouse in the example below:\n\n[iframe src=\"demo.svg?nocpath=1&p=0,0,0.5,0,0.5,1,1,1\" height=370]\n\n**As you can notice, the curve stretches along the tangential lines 1 -> 2 and 3 -> 4.**\n\nAfter some practice it becomes obvious how to place points to get the needed curve. And by connecting several curves we can get practically anything.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n![](bezier-car.svg) ![](bezier-letter.svg) ![](bezier-vase.svg)\n\n## De Casteljau's algorithm\n\nThere's a mathematical formula for Bezier curves, but let's cover it a bit later, because\n[De Casteljau's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Casteljau%27s_algorithm) is identical to the mathematical definition and visually shows how it is constructed.\n\nFirst let's see the 3-points example.\n\nHere's the demo, and the explanation follow.\n\nControl points (1,2 and 3) can be moved by the mouse. Press the \"play\" button to run it.\n\n[iframe src=\"demo.svg?p=0,0,0.5,1,1,0&animate=1\" height=370]\n\n**De Casteljau's algorithm of building the 3-point bezier curve:**\n\n1. Draw control points. In the demo above they are labeled: `1`, `2`, `3`.\n2. Build segments between control points 1 -> 2 -> 3. In the demo above they are <span style=\"color:#825E28\">brown</span>.\n3. The parameter `t` moves from `0` to `1`. In the example above the step `0.05` is used: the loop goes over `0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, ... 0.95, 1`.\n\n    For each of these values of `t`:\n\n    - On each <span style=\"color:#825E28\">brown</span> segment we take a point located on the distance proportional to `t` from its beginning. As there are two segments, we have two points.\n\n        For instance, for `t=0` -- both points will be at the beginning of segments, and for `t=0.25` -- on the 25% of segment length from the beginning, for `t=0.5` -- 50%(the middle), for `t=1` -- in the end of segments.\n\n    - Connect the points. On the picture below the connecting segment is painted <span style=\"color:#167490\">blue</span>.\n\n\n| For `t=0.25`             | For `t=0.5`            |\n| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |\n| ![](bezier3-draw1.svg)   | ![](bezier3-draw2.svg) |\n\n4. Now in the <span style=\"color:#167490\">blue</span> segment take a point on the distance proportional to the same value of `t`. That is, for `t=0.25` (the left picture) we have a point at the end of the left quarter of the segment, and for `t=0.5` (the right picture) -- in the middle of the segment. On pictures above that point is <span style=\"color:red\">red</span>.\n\n5. As `t` runs from `0` to `1`, every value of `t` adds a point to the curve. The set of such points forms the Bezier curve. It's red and parabolic on the pictures above.\n\nThat was a process for 3 points. But the same is for 4 points.\n\nThe demo for 4 points (points can be moved by a mouse):\n\n[iframe src=\"demo.svg?p=0,0,0.5,0,0.5,1,1,1&animate=1\" height=370]\n\nThe algorithm for 4 points:\n\n- Connect control points by segments: 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 4. There will be 3 <span style=\"color:#825E28\">brown</span> segments.\n- For each `t` in the interval from `0` to `1`:\n    - We take points on these segments on the distance proportional to `t` from the beginning. These points are connected, so that we have two <span style=\"color:#0A0\">green segments</span>.\n    - On these segments we take points proportional to `t`. We get one <span style=\"color:#167490\">blue segment</span>.\n    - On the blue segment we take a point proportional to `t`. On the example above it's <span style=\"color:red\">red</span>.\n- These points together form the curve.\n\nThe algorithm is recursive and can be generalized for any number of control points.\n\nGiven N of control points:\n\n1. We connect them to get initially N-1 segments.\n2. Then for each `t` from `0` to `1`, we take a point on each segment on the distance proportional to `t` and connect them. There will be N-2 segments.\n3. Repeat step 2 until there is only one point.\n\nThese points make the curve.\n\n```online\n**Run and pause examples to clearly see the segments and how the curve is built.**\n```\n\n\nA curve that looks like `y=1/t`:\n\n[iframe src=\"demo.svg?p=0,0,0,0.75,0.25,1,1,1&animate=1\" height=370]\n\nZig-zag control points also work fine:\n\n[iframe src=\"demo.svg?p=0,0,1,0.5,0,0.5,1,1&animate=1\" height=370]\n\nMaking a loop is possible:\n\n[iframe src=\"demo.svg?p=0,0,1,0.5,0,1,0.5,0&animate=1\" height=370]\n\nA non-smooth Bezier curve (yeah, that's possible too):\n\n[iframe src=\"demo.svg?p=0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0&animate=1\" height=370]\n\n```online\nIf there's something unclear in the algorithm description, please look at the live examples above to see how\nthe curve is built.\n```\n\nAs the algorithm is recursive, we can build Bezier curves of any order, that is: using 5, 6 or more control points. But in practice many points are less useful. Usually we take 2-3 points, and for complex lines glue several curves together. That's simpler to develop and calculate.\n\n```smart header=\"How to draw a curve *through* given points?\"\nTo specify a Bezier curve, control points are used. As we can see, they are not on the curve, except the first and the last ones.\n\nSometimes we have another task: to draw a curve *through several points*, so that all of them are on a single smooth curve. That task is called  [interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation), and here we don't cover it.\n\nThere are mathematical formulas for such curves, for instance [Lagrange polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial). In computer graphics [spline interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation) is often used to build smooth curves that connect many points.\n```\n\n\n## Maths\n\nA Bezier curve can be described using a mathematical formula.\n\nAs we saw -- there's actually no need to know it, most people just draw the curve by moving points with a mouse. But if you're into maths -- here it is.\n\nGiven the coordinates of control points <code>P<sub>i</sub></code>: the first control point has coordinates <code>P<sub>1</sub> = (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)</code>, the second: <code>P<sub>2</sub> = (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>)</code>, and so on, the curve coordinates are described by the equation that depends on the parameter `t` from the segment `[0,1]`.\n\n- The formula for a 2-points curve:\n\n    <code>P = (1-t)P<sub>1</sub> + tP<sub>2</sub></code>\n- For 3 control points:\n\n    <code>P = (1−t)<sup>2</sup>P<sub>1</sub> + 2(1−t)tP<sub>2</sub> + t<sup>2</sup>P<sub>3</sub></code>\n- For 4 control points:\n\n    <code>P = (1−t)<sup>3</sup>P<sub>1</sub> + 3(1−t)<sup>2</sup>tP<sub>2</sub>  +3(1−t)t<sup>2</sup>P<sub>3</sub> + t<sup>3</sup>P<sub>4</sub></code>\n\n\nThese are vector equations. In other words, we can put `x` and `y` instead of `P` to get corresponding coordinates.\n\nFor instance, the 3-point curve is formed by points `(x,y)` calculated as:\n\n- <code>x = (1−t)<sup>2</sup>x<sub>1</sub> + 2(1−t)tx<sub>2</sub> + t<sup>2</sup>x<sub>3</sub></code>\n- <code>y = (1−t)<sup>2</sup>y<sub>1</sub> + 2(1−t)ty<sub>2</sub> + t<sup>2</sup>y<sub>3</sub></code>\n\nInstead of <code>x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, y<sub>3</sub></code> we should put coordinates of 3 control points, and then as `t` moves from `0` to `1`, for each value of `t` we'll have `(x,y)` of the curve.\n\nFor instance, if control points are  `(0,0)`, `(0.5, 1)` and `(1, 0)`, the equations become:\n\n- <code>x = (1−t)<sup>2</sup> * 0 + 2(1−t)t * 0.5 + t<sup>2</sup> * 1 = (1-t)t + t<sup>2</sup> = t</code>\n- <code>y = (1−t)<sup>2</sup> * 0 + 2(1−t)t * 1 + t<sup>2</sup> * 0 = 2(1-t)t = –2t<sup>2</sup> + 2t</code>\n\nNow as `t` runs from `0` to `1`, the set of values `(x,y)` for each `t` forms the curve for such control points.\n\n## Summary\n\nBezier curves are defined by their control points.\n\nWe saw two definitions of Bezier curves:\n\n1. Using a drawing process: De Casteljau's algorithm.\n2. Using a mathematical formulas.\n\nGood properties of Bezier curves:\n\n- We can draw smooth lines with a mouse by moving control points.\n- Complex shapes can be made of several Bezier curves.\n\nUsage:\n\n- In computer graphics, modeling, vector graphic editors. Fonts are described by Bezier curves.\n- In web development -- for graphics on Canvas and in the SVG format. By the way, \"live\" examples above are written in SVG. They are actually a single SVG document that is given different points as parameters. You can open it in a separate window and see the source: [demo.svg](demo.svg?p=0,0,1,0.5,0,0.5,1,1&animate=1).\n- In CSS animation to describe the path and speed of animation.",

        "content": "\n\nCSS animations allow to do simple animations without JavaScript at all.\n\nJavaScript can be used to control CSS animation and make it even better with a little of code.\n\n## CSS transitions [#css-transition]\n\nThe idea of CSS transitions is simple. We describe a property and how its changes should be animated. When the property changes, the browser paints the animation.\n\nThat is: all we need is to change the property. And the fluent transition is made by the browser.\n\nFor instance, the CSS below animates changes of `background-color` for 3 seconds:\n\n```css\n.animated {\n  transition-property: background-color;\n  transition-duration: 3s;\n}\n```\n\nNow if an element has `.animated` class, any change of `background-color` is animated during 3 seconds.\n\nClick the button below to animate the background:\n\n```html run autorun height=60\n<button id=\"color\">Click me</button>\n\n<style>\n  #color {\n    transition-property: background-color;\n    transition-duration: 3s;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<script>\n  color.onclick = function() {\n    this.style.backgroundColor = 'red';\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\nThere are 4 properties to describe CSS transitions:\n\n- `transition-property`\n- `transition-duration`\n- `transition-timing-function`\n- `transition-delay`\n\nWe'll cover them in a moment, for now let's note that the common `transition` property allows to declare them together in the order: `property duration timing-function delay`, and also animate multiple properties at once.\n\nFor instance, this button animates both `color` and `font-size`:\n\n```html run height=80 autorun no-beautify\n<button id=\"growing\">Click me</button>\n\n<style>\n#growing {\n*!*\n  transition: font-size 3s, color 2s;\n*/!*\n}\n</style>\n\n<script>\ngrowing.onclick = function() {\n  this.style.fontSize = '36px';\n  this.style.color = 'red';\n};\n</script>\n```\n\nNow let's cover animation properties one by one.\n\n## transition-property\n\nIn `transition-property` we write a list of property to animate, for instance: `left`, `margin-left`, `height`, `color`.\n\nNot all properties can be animated, but [many of them](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/#animatable-properties-). The value `all` means \"animate all properties\".\n\n## transition-duration\n\nIn `transition-duration` we can specify how long the animation should take. The time should be in [CSS time format](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#time): in seconds `s` or milliseconds `ms`.\n\n## transition-delay\n\nIn `transition-delay` we can specify the delay *before* the animation. For instance, if  `transition-delay: 1s`, then animation starts after 1 second after the change.\n\nNegative values are also possible. Then the animation starts from the middle. For instance, if `transition-duration` is `2s`, and the delay is `-1s`, then the animation takes 1 second and starts from the half.\n\nHere's the animation shifts numbers from `0` to `9` using CSS `translate` property:\n\n[codetabs src=\"digits\"]\n\nThe `transform` property is animated like this:\n\n```css\n#stripe.animate {\n  transform: translate(-90%);\n  transition-property: transform;\n  transition-duration: 9s;\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above JavaScript adds the class `.animate` to the element -- and the animation starts:\n\n```js\nstripe.classList.add('animate');\n```\n\nWe can also start it \"from the middle\", from the exact number, e.g. corresponding to the current second, using the negative `transition-delay`.\n\nHere if you click the digit -- it starts the animation from the current second:\n\n[codetabs src=\"digits-negative-delay\"]\n\nJavaScript does it by an extra line:\n\n```js\nstripe.onclick = function() {\n  let sec = new Date().getSeconds() % 10;\n*!*\n  // for instance, -3s here starts the animation from the 3rd second\n  stripe.style.transitionDelay = '-' + sec + 's';\n*/!*\n  stripe.classList.add('animate');\n};\n```\n\n## transition-timing-function\n\nTiming function describes how the animation process is distributed along the time. Will it start slowly and then go fast or vise versa.\n\nThat's the most complicated property from the first sight. But it becomes very simple if we devote a bit time to it.\n\nThat property accepts two kinds of values: a Bezier curve or steps. Let's start from the curve, as it's used more often.\n\n### Bezier curve\n\nThe timing function can be set as a [Bezier curve](/bezier-curve) with 4 control points that satisfies the conditions:\n\n1. First control point: `(0,0)`.\n2. Last control point: `(1,1)`.\n3. For intermediate points values of `x` must be in the interval `0..1`, `y` can be anything.\n\nThe syntax for a Bezier curve in CSS: `cubic-bezier(x2, y2, x3, y3)`. Here we need to specify only 2nd and 3rd control points, because the 1st one is fixed to `(0,0)` and the 4th one is `(1,1)`.\n\nThe timing function describes how fast the animation process goes in time.\n\n- The `x` axis is the time: `0` -- the starting moment, `1` -- the last moment of `transition-duration`.\n- The `y` axis specifies the completion of the process: `0` -- the starting value of the property, `1` -- the final value.\n\nThe simplest variant is when the animation goes uniformly, with the same linear speed. That can be specified by the curve `cubic-bezier(0, 0, 1, 1)`.\n\nHere's how that curve looks:\n\n![](bezier-linear.svg)\n\n...As we can see, it's just a straight line. As the time (`x`) passes, the completion (`y`) of the animation steadily goes from `0` to `1`.\n\nThe train in the example below goes from left to right with the permanent speed (click it):\n\n[codetabs src=\"train-linear\"]\n\nThe CSS `transition` is based on that curve:\n\n```css\n.train {\n  left: 0;\n  transition: left 5s cubic-bezier(0, 0, 1, 1);\n  /* JavaScript sets left to 450px */\n}\n```\n\n...And how can we show a train slowing down?\n\nWe can use another Bezier curve: `cubic-bezier(0.0, 0.5, 0.5 ,1.0)`.\n\nThe graph:\n\n![](train-curve.svg)\n\nAs we can see, the process starts fast: the curve soars up high, and then slower and slower.\n\nHere's the timing function in action (click the train):\n\n[codetabs src=\"train\"]\n\nCSS:\n```css\n.train {\n  left: 0;\n  transition: left 5s cubic-bezier(0, .5, .5, 1);\n  /* JavaScript sets left to 450px */\n}\n```\n\nThere are several built-in curves: `linear`, `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out` and `ease-in-out`.\n\nThe `linear` is a shorthand for `cubic-bezier(0, 0, 1, 1)` -- a straight line, we saw it already.\n\nOther names are shorthands for the following `cubic-bezier`:\n\n| <code>ease</code><sup>*</sup> | <code>ease-in</code> | <code>ease-out</code> | <code>ease-in-out</code> |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|\n| <code>(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0)</code> | <code>(0.42, 0, 1.0, 1.0)</code> | <code>(0, 0, 0.58, 1.0)</code> | <code>(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1.0)</code> |\n| ![ease, figure](ease.svg) | ![ease-in, figure](ease-in.svg) | ![ease-out, figure](ease-out.svg) | ![ease-in-out, figure](ease-in-out.svg) |\n\n`*` -- by default, if there's no timing function, `ease` is used.\n\nSo we could use `ease-out` for our slowing down train:\n\n\n```css\n.train {\n  left: 0;\n  transition: left 5s ease-out;\n  /* transition: left 5s cubic-bezier(0, .5, .5, 1); */\n}\n```\n\nBut it looks a bit differently.\n\n**A Bezier curve can make the animation \"jump out\" of its range.**\n\nThe control points on the curve can have any `y` coordinates: even negative or huge. Then the Bezier curve would also jump very low or high, making the animation go beyond its normal range.\n\nIn the example below the animation code is:\n```css\n.train {\n  left: 100px;\n  transition: left 5s cubic-bezier(.5, -1, .5, 2);\n  /* JavaScript sets left to 400px */\n}\n```\n\nThe property `left` should animate from `100px` to `400px`.\n\nBut if you click the train, you'll see that:\n\n- First, the train goes *back*: `left` becomes less than `100px`.\n- Then it goes forward, a little bit farther than `400px`.\n- And then back again -- to `400px`.\n\n[codetabs src=\"train-over\"]\n\nWhy it happens -- pretty obvious if we look at the graph of the given Bezier curve:\n\n![](bezier-train-over.svg)\n\nWe moved the `y` coordinate of the 2nd point below zero, and for the 3rd point we made put it over `1`, so the curve goes out of the \"regular\" quadrant. The `y` is out of the \"standard\" range `0..1`.\n\nAs we know, `y` measures \"the completion of the animation process\". The value `y = 0` corresponds to the starting property value and `y = 1` -- the ending value. So values `y<0` move the property lower than the starting `left` and `y>1` -- over the final `left`.\n\nThat's a \"soft\" variant for sure. If we put `y` values like `-99` and `99` then the train would jump out of the range much more.\n\nBut how to make the Bezier curve for a specific task? There are many tools. For instance, we can do it on the site <http://cubic-bezier.com/>.\n\n### Steps\n\nTiming function `steps(number of steps[, start/end])` allows to split animation into steps.\n\nLet's see that in an example with digits.\n\nHere's a list of digits, without any animations, just as a source:\n\n[codetabs src=\"step-list\"]\n\nWe'll make the digits appear in a discrete way by making the part of the list outside of the red \"window\" invisible and shifting the list to the left with each step.\n\nThere will be 9 steps, a step-move for each digit:\n\n```css\n#stripe.animate  {\n  transform: translate(-90%);\n  transition: transform 9s *!*steps(9, start)*/!*;\n}\n```\n\nIn action:\n\n[codetabs src=\"step\"]\n\nThe first argument of `steps(9, start)` is the number of steps. The transform will be split into 9 parts (10% each). The time interval is automatically divided into 9 parts as well, so `transition: 9s` gives us 9 seconds for the whole animation – 1 second per digit.\n\nThe second argument is one of two words: `start` or `end`.\n\nThe `start` means that in the beginning of animation we need to do make the first step immediately.\n\nWe can observe that during the animation: when we click on the digit it changes to `1` (the first step) immediately, and then changes in the beginning of the next second.\n\nThe process is progressing like this:\n\n- `0s` -- `-10%` (first change in the beginning of the 1st second, immediately)\n- `1s` -- `-20%`\n- ...\n- `8s` -- `-80%`\n- (the last second shows the final value).\n\nThe alternative value `end` would mean that the change should be applied not in the beginning, but at the end of each second.\n\nSo the process would go like this:\n\n- `0s` -- `0`\n- `1s` -- `-10%` (first change at the end of the 1st second)\n- `2s` -- `-20%`\n- ...\n- `9s` -- `-90%`\n\nHere's `steps(9, end)` in action (note the pause between the first digit change):\n\n[codetabs src=\"step-end\"]\n\nThere are also shorthand values:\n\n- `step-start` -- is the same as `steps(1, start)`. That is, the animation starts immediately and takes 1 step. So it starts and finishes immediately, as if there were no animation.\n- `step-end` -- the same as `steps(1, end)`: make the animation in a single step at the end of `transition-duration`.\n\nThese values are rarely used, because that's not really animation, but rather a single-step change.\n\n## Event transitionend\n\nWhen the CSS animation finishes the `transitionend` event triggers.\n\nIt is widely used to do an action after the animation is done. Also we can join animations.\n\nFor instance, the ship in the example below starts to swim there and back on click, each time farther and farther to the right:\n\n[iframe src=\"boat\" height=300 edit link]\n\nThe animation is initiated by the function `go` that re-runs each time when the transition finishes and flips the direction:\n\n```js\nboat.onclick = function() {\n  //...\n  let times = 1;\n\n  function go() {\n    if (times % 2) {\n      // swim to the right\n      boat.classList.remove('back');\n      boat.style.marginLeft = 100 * times + 200 + 'px';\n    } else {\n      // swim to the left\n      boat.classList.add('back');\n      boat.style.marginLeft = 100 * times - 200 + 'px';\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  go();\n\n  boat.addEventListener('transitionend', function() {\n    times++;\n    go();\n  });\n};\n```\n\nThe event object for `transitionend` has few specific properties:\n\n`event.propertyName`\n: The property that has finished animating. Can be good if we animate multiple properties simultaneously.\n\n`event.elapsedTime`\n: The time (in seconds) that the animation took, without `transition-delay`.\n\n## Keyframes\n\nWe can join multiple simple animations together using the `@keyframes` CSS rule.\n\nIt specifies the \"name\" of the animation and rules: what, when and where to animate. Then using the `animation` property we attach the animation to the element and specify additional parameters for it.\n\nHere's an example with explanations:\n\n```html run height=60 autorun=\"no-epub\" no-beautify\n<div class=\"progress\"></div>\n\n<style>\n*!*\n  @keyframes go-left-right {        /* give it a name: \"go-left-right\" */\n    from { left: 0px; }             /* animate from left: 0px */\n    to { left: calc(100% - 50px); } /* animate to left: 100%-50px */\n  }\n*/!*\n\n  .progress {\n*!*\n    animation: go-left-right 3s infinite alternate;\n    /* apply the animation \"go-left-right\" to the element\n       duration 3 seconds\n       number of times: infinite\n       alternate direction every time\n    */\n*/!*\n\n    position: relative;\n    border: 2px solid green;\n    width: 50px;\n    height: 20px;\n    background: lime;\n  }\n</style>\n```\n\nThere are many articles about `@keyframes` and a [detailed specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-animations/).\n\nProbably you won't need `@keyframes` often, unless everything is in the constant move on your sites.\n\n## Summary\n\nCSS animations allow to smoothly (or not) animate changes of one or multiple CSS properties.\n\nThey are good for most animation tasks. We're also able to use JavaScript for animations, the next chapter is devoted to that.\n\nLimitations of CSS animations compared to JavaScript animations:\n\n```compare plus=\"CSS animations\" minus=\"JavaScript animations\"\n+ Simple things done simply.\n+ Fast and lightweight for CPU.\n- JavaScript animations are flexible. They can implement any animation logic, like an \"explosion\" of an element.\n- Not just property changes. We can create new elements in JavaScript for purposes of animation.\n```\n\nThe majority of animations can be implemented using CSS as described in this chapter. And  `transitionend` event allows to run JavaScript after the animation, so it integrates fine with the code.\n\nBut in the next chapter we'll do some JavaScript animations to cover more complex cases.",

        "content": "\n\nJavaScript animations can handle things that CSS can't.\n\nFor instance, moving along a complex path, with a timing function different from Bezier curves, or an animation on a canvas.\n\n## Using setInterval\n\nAn animation can be implemented as a sequence of frames -- usually small changes to HTML/CSS properties.\n\nFor instance, changing `style.left` from `0px` to `100px` moves the element. And if we increase it in `setInterval`, changing by `2px` with a tiny delay, like 50 times per second, then it looks smooth. That's the same principle as in the cinema: 24 frames per second is enough to make it look smooth.\n\nThe pseudo-code can look like this:\n\n```js\nlet timer = setInterval(function() {\n  if (animation complete) clearInterval(timer);\n  else increase style.left by 2px\n}, 20); // change by 2px every 20ms, about 50 frames per second\n```\n\nMore complete example of the animation:\n\n```js\nlet start = Date.now(); // remember start time\n\nlet timer = setInterval(function() {\n  // how much time passed from the start?\n  let timePassed = Date.now() - start;\n\n  if (timePassed >= 2000) {\n    clearInterval(timer); // finish the animation after 2 seconds\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // draw the animation at the moment timePassed\n  draw(timePassed);\n\n}, 20);\n\n// as timePassed goes from 0 to 2000\n// left gets values from 0px to 400px\nfunction draw(timePassed) {\n  train.style.left = timePassed / 5 + 'px';\n}\n```\n\nClick for the demo:\n\n[codetabs height=200 src=\"move\"]\n\n## Using requestAnimationFrame\n\nLet's imagine we have several animations running simultaneously.\n\nIf we run them separately, then even though each one has `setInterval(..., 20)`, then the browser would have to repaint much more often than every `20ms`.\n\nThat's because they have different starting time, so \"every 20ms\" differs between different animations. The intervals are not aligned. So we'll have several independent runs within `20ms`.\n\nIn other words, this:\n\n```js\nsetInterval(function() {\n  animate1();\n  animate2();\n  animate3();\n}, 20)\n```\n\n...Is lighter than three independent calls:\n\n```js\nsetInterval(animate1, 20); // independent animations\nsetInterval(animate2, 20); // in different places of the script\nsetInterval(animate3, 20);\n```\n\nThese several independent redraws should be grouped together, to make the redraw easier for the browser and hence load less CPU load and look smoother.\n\nThere's one more thing to keep in mind. Sometimes when CPU is overloaded, or there are other reasons to redraw less often (like when the browser tab is hidden), so we really shouldn't run it every `20ms`.\n\nBut how do we know about that in JavaScript? There's a specification [Animation timing](http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/) that provides the function `requestAnimationFrame`. It addresses all these issues and even more.\n\nThe syntax:\n```js\nlet requestId = requestAnimationFrame(callback)\n```\n\nThat schedules the `callback` function to run in the closest time when the browser wants to do animation.\n\nIf we do changes in elements in `callback` then they will be grouped together with other `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks and with CSS animations. So there will be one geometry recalculation and repaint instead of many.\n\nThe returned value `requestId` can be used to cancel the call:\n```js\n// cancel the scheduled execution of callback\ncancelAnimationFrame(requestId);\n```\n\nThe `callback` gets one argument -- the time passed from the beginning of the page load in microseconds. This time can also be obtained by calling [performance.now()](mdn:api/Performance/now).\n\nUsually `callback` runs very soon, unless the CPU is overloaded or the laptop battery is almost discharged, or there's another reason.\n\nThe code below shows the time between first 10 runs for `requestAnimationFrame`. Usually it's 10-20ms:\n\n```html run height=40 refresh\n<script>\n  let prev = performance.now();\n  let times = 0;\n\n  requestAnimationFrame(function measure(time) {\n    document.body.insertAdjacentHTML(\"beforeEnd\", Math.floor(time - prev) + \" \");\n    prev = time;\n\n    if (times++ < 10) requestAnimationFrame(measure);\n  })\n</script>\n```\n\n## Structured animation\n\nNow we can make a more universal animation function based on `requestAnimationFrame`:\n\n```js\nfunction animate({timing, draw, duration}) {\n\n  let start = performance.now();\n\n  requestAnimationFrame(function animate(time) {\n    // timeFraction goes from 0 to 1\n    let timeFraction = (time - start) / duration;\n    if (timeFraction > 1) timeFraction = 1;\n\n    // calculate the current animation state\n    let progress = timing(timeFraction)\n\n    draw(progress); // draw it\n\n    if (timeFraction < 1) {\n      requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n    }\n\n  });\n}\n```\n\nFunction `animate` accepts 3 parameters that essentially describes the animation:\n\n`duration`\n: Total time of animation. Like, `1000`.\n\n`timing(timeFraction)`\n: Timing function, like CSS-property `transition-timing-function` that gets the fraction of time that passed (`0` at start, `1` at the end) and returns the animation completion (like `y` on the Bezier curve).\n\n    For instance, a linear function means that the animation goes on uniformly with the same speed:\n\n    ```js\n    function linear(timeFraction) {\n      return timeFraction;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    It's graph:\n    ![](linear.svg)\n\n    That's just like `transition-timing-function: linear`. There are more interesting variants shown below.\n\n`draw(progress)`\n: The function that takes the animation completion state and draws it. The value `progress=0` denotes the beginning animation state, and `progress=1` -- the end state.\n\n    This is that function that actually draws out the animation.\n\n    It can move the element:\n    ```js\n    function draw(progress) {\n      train.style.left = progress + 'px';\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ...Or do anything else, we can animate anything, in any way.\n\n\nLet's animate the element `width` from `0` to `100%` using our function.\n\nClick on the element for the demo:\n\n[codetabs height=60 src=\"width\"]\n\nThe code for it:\n\n```js\nanimate({\n  duration: 1000,\n  timing(timeFraction) {\n    return timeFraction;\n  },\n  draw(progress) {\n    elem.style.width = progress * 100 + '%';\n  }\n});\n```\n\nUnlike CSS animation, we can make any timing function and any drawing function here. The timing function is not limited by Bezier curves. And `draw` can go beyond properties, create new elements for like fireworks animation or something.\n\n## Timing functions\n\nWe saw the simplest, linear timing function above.\n\nLet's see more of them. We'll try movement animations with different timing functions to see how they work.\n\n### Power of n\n\nIf we want to speed up the animation, we can use `progress` in the power `n`.\n\nFor instance, a parabolic curve:\n\n```js\nfunction quad(timeFraction) {\n  return Math.pow(timeFraction, 2)\n}\n```\n\nThe graph:\n\n![](quad.svg)\n\nSee in action (click to activate):\n\n[iframe height=40 src=\"quad\" link]\n\n...Or the cubic curve or event greater `n`. Increasing the power makes it speed up faster.\n\nHere's the graph for `progress` in the power `5`:\n\n![](quint.svg)\n\nIn action:\n\n[iframe height=40 src=\"quint\" link]\n\n### The arc\n\nFunction:\n\n```js\nfunction circ(timeFraction) {\n  return 1 - Math.sin(Math.acos(timeFraction));\n}\n```\n\nThe graph:\n\n![](circ.svg)\n\n[iframe height=40 src=\"circ\" link]\n\n### Back: bow shooting\n\nThis function does the \"bow shooting\". First we \"pull the bowstring\", and then \"shoot\".\n\nUnlike previous functions, it depends on an additional parameter `x`, the \"elasticity coefficient\". The distance of \"bowstring pulling\" is defined by it.\n\nThe code:\n\n```js\nfunction back(x, timeFraction) {\n  return Math.pow(timeFraction, 2) * ((x + 1) * timeFraction - x)\n}\n```\n\n**The graph for `x = 1.5`:**\n\n![](back.svg)\n\nFor animation we use it with a specific value of `x`. Example for `x = 1.5`:\n\n[iframe height=40 src=\"back\" link]\n\n### Bounce\n\nImagine we are dropping a ball. It falls down, then bounces back a few times and stops.\n\nThe `bounce` function does the same, but in the reverse order: \"bouncing\" starts immediately. It uses few special coefficients for that:\n\n```js\nfunction bounce(timeFraction) {\n  for (let a = 0, b = 1, result; 1; a += b, b /= 2) {\n    if (timeFraction >= (7 - 4 * a) / 11) {\n      return -Math.pow((11 - 6 * a - 11 * timeFraction) / 4, 2) + Math.pow(b, 2)\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn action:\n\n[iframe height=40 src=\"bounce\" link]\n\n### Elastic animation\n\nOne more \"elastic\" function that accepts an additional parameter `x` for the \"initial range\".\n\n```js\nfunction elastic(x, timeFraction) {\n  return Math.pow(2, 10 * (timeFraction - 1)) * Math.cos(20 * Math.PI * x / 3 * timeFraction)\n}\n```\n\n**The graph for `x=1.5`:**\n![](elastic.svg)\n\nIn action for `x=1.5`:\n\n[iframe height=40 src=\"elastic\" link]\n\n## Reversal: ease*\n\nSo we have a collection of timing functions. Their direct application is called \"easeIn\".\n\nSometimes we need to show the animation in the reverse order. That's done with the \"easeOut\" transform.\n\n### easeOut\n\nIn the \"easeOut\" mode the `timing` function is put into a wrapper `timingEaseOut`:\n\n```js\ntimingEaseOut(timeFraction) = 1 - timing(1 - timeFraction)\n```\n\nIn other words, we have a \"transform\" function `makeEaseOut` that takes a \"regular\" timing function and returns the wrapper around it:\n\n```js\n// accepts a timing function, returns the transformed variant\nfunction makeEaseOut(timing) {\n  return function(timeFraction) {\n    return 1 - timing(1 - timeFraction);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor instance, we can take the `bounce` function described above and apply it:\n\n```js\nlet bounceEaseOut = makeEaseOut(bounce);\n```\n\nThen the bounce will be not in the beginning, but at the end of the animation. Looks even better:\n\n[codetabs src=\"bounce-easeout\"]\n\nHere we can see how the transform changes the behavior of the function:\n\n![](bounce-inout.svg)\n\nIf there's an animation effect in the beginning, like bouncing -- it will be shown at the end.\n\nIn the graph above the <span style=\"color:#EE6B47\">regular bounce</span> has the red color, and the <span style=\"color:#62C0DC\">easeOut bounce</span> is blue.\n\n- Regular bounce -- the object bounces at the bottom, then at the end sharply jumps to the top.\n- After `easeOut` -- it first jumps to the top, then bounces there.\n\n### easeInOut\n\nWe also can show the effect both in the beginning and the end of the animation. The transform is called \"easeInOut\".\n\nGiven the timing function, we calculate the animation state like this:\n\n```js\nif (timeFraction <= 0.5) { // first half of the animation\n  return timing(2 * timeFraction) / 2;\n} else { // second half of the animation\n  return (2 - timing(2 * (1 - timeFraction))) / 2;\n}\n```\n\nThe wrapper code:\n\n```js\nfunction makeEaseInOut(timing) {\n  return function(timeFraction) {\n    if (timeFraction < .5)\n      return timing(2 * timeFraction) / 2;\n    else\n      return (2 - timing(2 * (1 - timeFraction))) / 2;\n  }\n}\n\nbounceEaseInOut = makeEaseInOut(bounce);\n```\n\nIn action, `bounceEaseInOut`:\n\n[codetabs src=\"bounce-easeinout\"]\n\nThe \"easeInOut\" transform joins two graphs into one: `easeIn` (regular) for the first half of the animation and `easeOut` (reversed) -- for the second part.\n\nThe effect is clearly seen if we compare the graphs of `easeIn`, `easeOut` and `easeInOut` of the `circ` timing function:\n\n![](circ-ease.svg)\n\n- <span style=\"color:#EE6B47\">Red</span> is the regular variantof `circ` (`easeIn`).\n- <span style=\"color:#8DB173\">Green</span> -- `easeOut`.\n- <span style=\"color:#62C0DC\">Blue</span> -- `easeInOut`.\n\nAs we can see, the graph of the first half of the animation is the scaled down `easeIn`, and the second half is the scaled down `easeOut`. As a result, the animation starts and finishes with the same effect.\n\n## More interesting \"draw\"\n\nInstead of moving the element we can do something else. All we need is to write the write the proper `draw`.\n\nHere's the animated \"bouncing\" text typing:\n\n[codetabs src=\"text\"]\n\n## Summary\n\nFor animations that CSS can't handle well, or those that need tight control, JavaScript can help. JavaScript animations should be implemented via `requestAnimationFrame`. That built-in method allows to setup a callback function to run when the browser will be preparing a repaint. Usually that's very soon, but the exact time depends on the browser.\n\nWhen a page is in the background, there are no repaints at all, so the callback won't run: the animation will be suspended and won't consume resources. That's great.\n\nHere's the helper `animate` function to setup most animations:\n\n```js\nfunction animate({timing, draw, duration}) {\n\n  let start = performance.now();\n\n  requestAnimationFrame(function animate(time) {\n    // timeFraction goes from 0 to 1\n    let timeFraction = (time - start) / duration;\n    if (timeFraction > 1) timeFraction = 1;\n\n    // calculate the current animation state\n    let progress = timing(timeFraction);\n\n    draw(progress); // draw it\n\n    if (timeFraction < 1) {\n      requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n    }\n\n  });\n}\n```\n\nOptions:\n\n- `duration` -- the total animation time in ms.\n- `timing` -- the function to calculate animation progress. Gets a time fraction from 0 to 1, returns the animation progress, usually from 0 to 1.\n- `draw` -- the function to draw the animation.\n\nSurely we could improve it, add more bells and whistles, but JavaScript animations are not applied on a daily basis. They are used to do something interesting and non-standard. So you'd want to add the features that you need when you need them.\n\nJavaScript animations can use any timing function. We covered a lot of examples and transformations to make them even more versatile. Unlike CSS, we are not limited to Bezier curves here.\n\nThe same is about `draw`: we can animate anything, not just CSS properties.",

Some features are well-supported and integrated into the modern HTML/DOM standard, while others are yet in draft stage. You can try examples in any browser, Google Chrome is probably the most up to date with these features. Guess, that's because Google fellows are behind many of the related specifications.\n\n## What's common between...\n\nThe whole component idea is nothing new. It's used in many frameworks and elsewhere.\n\nBefore we move to implementation details, take a look at this great achievement of humanity:\n\n![](satellite.jpg)\n\nThat's the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nAnd this is how it's made inside (approximately):\n\n![](satellite-expanded.jpg)\n\nThe International Space Station:\n- Consists of many components.\n- Each component, in its turn, has many smaller details inside.\n- The components are very complex, much more complicated than most websites.\n- Components are developed internationally, by teams from different countries, speaking different languages.\n\n...And this thing flies, keeps humans alive in space!\n\nHow such complex devices are created?\n\nWhich principles we could borrow to make our development same-level reliable and scalable? Or, at least, close to it.\n\n## Component architecture\n\nThe well known rule for developing complex software is: don't make complex software.\n\nIf something becomes complex -- split it into simpler parts and connect in the most obvious way.\n\n**A good architect is the one who can make the complex simple.**\n\nWe can split user interface into visual components: each of them has own place on the page, can \"do\" a well-described task, and is separate from the others.\n\nLet's take a look at a website, for example Twitter.\n\nIt naturally splits into components:\n\n![](web-components-twitter.svg)\n\n1. Top navigation.\n2. User info.\n3. Follow suggestions.\n4. Submit form.\n5. (and also 6, 7) -- messages.\n\nComponents may have subcomponents, e.g. messages may be parts of a higher-level \"message list\" component. A clickable user picture itself may be a component, and so on.\n\nHow do we decide, what is a component? That comes from intuition, experience and common sense. Usually it's a separate visual entity that we can describe in terms of what it does and how it interacts with the page. In the case above, the page has blocks, each of them plays its own role, it's logical to make these components.\n\nA component has:\n- Its own JavaScript class.\n- DOM structure, managed solely by its class, outside code doesn't access it (\"encapsulation\" principle).\n- CSS styles, applied to the component.\n- API: events, class methods etc, to interact with other components.\n\nOnce again, the whole \"component\" thing is nothing special.\n\nThere exist many frameworks and development methodologies to build them, each with its own bells and whistles. Usually, special CSS classes and conventions are used to provide \"component feel\" -- CSS scoping and DOM encapsulation.\n\n\"Web components\" provide built-in browser capabilities for that, so we don't have to emulate them any more.\n\n- [Custom elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements) -- to define custom HTML elements.\n- [Shadow DOM](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#shadow-trees) -- to create an internal DOM for the component, hidden from the others.\n- [CSS Scoping](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/) -- to declare styles that only apply inside the Shadow DOM of the component.\n- [Event retargeting](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#retarget) and other minor stuff to make custom components better fit the development.\n\nIn the next chapter we'll go into details of \"Custom Elements\" -- the fundamental and well-supported feature of web components, good on its own.",

        "content": "\n\nWe can create custom HTML elements, described by our class, with its own methods and properties, events and so on.\n\nOnce a custom element is defined, we can use it on par with built-in HTML elements.\n\nThat's great, as HTML dictionary is rich, but not infinite. There are no `<easy-tabs>`, `<sliding-carousel>`, `<beautiful-upload>`... Just think of any other tag we might need.\n\nWe can define them with a special class, and then use as if they were always a part of HTML.\n\nThere are two kinds of custom elements:\n\n1. **Autonomous custom elements** -- \"all-new\" elements, extending the abstract `HTMLElement` class.\n2. **Customized built-in elements** -- extending built-in elements, like a customized button, based on `HTMLButtonElement` etc.\n\nFirst we'll cover autonomous elements, and then move to customized built-in ones.\n\nTo create a custom element, we need to tell the browser several details about it: how to show it, what to do when the element is added or removed to page, etc.\n\nThat's done by making a class with special methods. That's easy, as there are only few methods, and all of them are optional.\n\nHere's a sketch with the full list:\n\n```js\nclass MyElement extends HTMLElement {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    // element created\n  }\n\n  connectedCallback() {\n    // browser calls this method when the element is added to the document\n    // (can be called many times if an element is repeatedly added/removed)\n  }\n\n  disconnectedCallback() {\n    // browser calls this method when the element is removed from the document\n    // (can be called many times if an element is repeatedly added/removed)\n  }\n\n  static get observedAttributes() {\n    return [/* array of attribute names to monitor for changes */];\n  }\n\n  attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue) {\n    // called when one of attributes listed above is modified\n  }\n\n  adoptedCallback() {\n    // called when the element is moved to a new document\n    // (happens in document.adoptNode, very rarely used)\n  }\n\n  // there can be other element methods and properties\n}\n```\n\nAfter that, we need to register the element:\n\n```js\n// let the browser know that <my-element> is served by our new class\ncustomElements.define(\"my-element\", MyElement);\n```\n\nNow for any HTML elements with tag `<my-element>`, an instance of `MyElement` is created, and the aforementioned methods are called. We also can `document.createElement('my-element')` in JavaScript.\n\n```smart header=\"Custom element name must contain a hyphen `-`\"\nCustom element name must have a hyphen `-`, e.g. `my-element` and `super-button` are valid names, but `myelement` is not.\n\nThat's to ensure that there are no name conflicts between built-in and custom HTML elements.\n```\n\n## Example: \"time-formatted\"\n\nFor example, there already exists `<time>` element in HTML, for date/time. But it doesn't do any formatting by itself.\n\nLet's create `<time-formatted>` element that displays the time in a nice, language-aware format:\n\n\n```html run height=50 autorun=\"no-epub\"\n<script>\n*!*\nclass TimeFormatted extends HTMLElement { // (1)\n*/!*\n\n  connectedCallback() {\n    let date = new Date(this.getAttribute('datetime') || Date.now());\n\n    this.innerHTML = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(\"default\", {\n      year: this.getAttribute('year') || undefined,\n      month: this.getAttribute('month') || undefined,\n      day: this.getAttribute('day') || undefined,\n      hour: this.getAttribute('hour') || undefined,\n      minute: this.getAttribute('minute') || undefined,\n      second: this.getAttribute('second') || undefined,\n      timeZoneName: this.getAttribute('time-zone-name') || undefined,\n    }).format(date);\n  }\n\n}\n\n*!*\ncustomElements.define(\"time-formatted\", TimeFormatted); // (2)\n*/!*\n</script>\n\n<!-- (3) -->\n*!*\n<time-formatted datetime=\"2019-12-01\"\n*/!*\n  year=\"numeric\" month=\"long\" day=\"numeric\"\n  hour=\"numeric\" minute=\"numeric\" second=\"numeric\"\n  time-zone-name=\"short\"\n></time-formatted>\n```\n\n1. The class has only one method `connectedCallback()` -- the browser calls it when `<time-formatted>` element is added to page (or when HTML parser detects it), and it uses the built-in [Intl.DateTimeFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DateTimeFormat) data formatter, well-supported across the browsers, to show a nicely formatted time.\n2. We need to register our new element by `customElements.define(tag, class)`.\n3. And then we can use it everywhere.\n\n\n```smart header=\"Custom elements upgrade\"\nIf the browser encounters any `<time-formatted>` elements before `customElements.define`, that's not an error. But the element is yet unknown, just like any non-standard tag.\n\nSuch \"undefined\" elements can be styled with CSS selector `:not(:defined)`.\n\nWhen `customElement.define` is called, they are \"upgraded\": a new instance of `TimeFormatted`\nis created for each, and `connectedCallback` is called. They become `:defined`.\n\nTo get the information about custom elements, there are methods:\n- `customElements.get(name)` -- returns the class for a custom element with the given `name`,\n- `customElements.whenDefined(name)` -- returns a promise that resolves (without value) when a custom element with the given `name` becomes defined.\n```\n\n```smart header=\"Rendering in `connectedCallback`, not in `constructor`\"\nIn the example above, element content is rendered (created) in `connectedCallback`.\n\nWhy not in the `constructor`?\n\nThe reason is simple: when `constructor` is called, it's yet too early. The element is created, but the browser did not yet process/assign attributes at this stage: calls to `getAttribute` would return `null`. So we can't really render there.\n\nBesides, if you think about it, that's better performance-wise -- to delay the work until it's really needed.\n\nThe `connectedCallback` triggers when the element is added to the document. Not just appended to another element as a child, but actually becomes a part of the page. So we can build detached DOM, create elements and prepare them for later use. They will only be actually rendered when they make it into the page.\n```\n\n## Observing attributes\n\nIn the current implementation of `<time-formatted>`, after the element is rendered, further attribute changes don't have any effect. That's strange for an HTML element. Usually, when we change an attribute, like `a.href`, we expect the change to be immediately visible. So let's fix this.\n\nWe can observe attributes by providing their list in `observedAttributes()` static getter. For such attributes, `attributeChangedCallback` is called when they are modified. It doesn't trigger for an attribute for performance reasons.\n\nHere's a new `<time-formatted>`, that auto-updates when attributes change:\n\n```html run autorun=\"no-epub\" height=50\n<script>\nclass TimeFormatted extends HTMLElement {\n\n*!*\n  render() { // (1)\n*/!*\n    let date = new Date(this.getAttribute('datetime') || Date.now());\n\n    this.innerHTML = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(\"default\", {\n      year: this.getAttribute('year') || undefined,\n      month: this.getAttribute('month') || undefined,\n      day: this.getAttribute('day') || undefined,\n      hour: this.getAttribute('hour') || undefined,\n      minute: this.getAttribute('minute') || undefined,\n      second: this.getAttribute('second') || undefined,\n      timeZoneName: this.getAttribute('time-zone-name') || undefined,\n    }).format(date);\n  }\n\n*!*\n  connectedCallback() { // (2)\n*/!*\n    if (!this.rendered) {\n      this.render();\n      this.rendered = true;\n    }\n  }\n\n*!*\n  static get observedAttributes() { // (3)\n*/!*\n    return ['datetime', 'year', 'month', 'day', 'hour', 'minute', 'second', 'time-zone-name'];\n  }\n\n*!*\n  attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue) { // (4)\n*/!*\n    this.render();\n  }\n\n}\n\ncustomElements.define(\"time-formatted\", TimeFormatted);\n</script>\n\n<time-formatted id=\"elem\" hour=\"numeric\" minute=\"numeric\" second=\"numeric\"></time-formatted>\n\n<script>\n*!*\nsetInterval(() => elem.setAttribute('datetime', new Date()), 1000); // (5)\n*/!*\n</script>\n```\n\n1. The rendering logic is moved to `render()` helper method.\n2. We call it once when the element is inserted into page.\n3. For a change of an attribute, listed in `observedAttributes()`, `attributeChangedCallback` triggers.\n4. ...and re-renders the element.\n5. At the end, we can easily make a live timer.\n\n## Rendering order\n\nWhen HTML parser builds the DOM, elements are processed one after another, parents before children. E.g. if we have `<outer><inner></inner></outer>`, then `<outer>` element is created and connected to DOM first, and then `<inner>`.\n\nThat leads to important consequences for custom elements.\n\nFor example, if a custom element tries to access `innerHTML` in `connectedCallback`, it gets nothing:\n\n```html run height=40\n<script>\ncustomElements.define('user-info', class extends HTMLElement {\n\n  connectedCallback() {\n*!*\n    alert(this.innerHTML); // empty (*)\n*/!*\n  }\n\n});\n</script>\n\n*!*\n<user-info>John</user-info>\n*/!*\n```\n\nIf you run it, the `alert` is empty.\n\nThat's exactly because there are no children on that stage, the DOM is unfinished. HTML parser connected the custom element `<user-info>`, and is going to proceed to its children, but just didn't yet.\n\nIf we'd like to pass information to custom element, we can use attributes. They are available immediately.\n\nOr, if we really need the children, we can defer access to them with zero-delay `setTimeout`.\n\nThis works:\n\n```html run height=40\n<script>\ncustomElements.define('user-info', class extends HTMLElement {\n\n  connectedCallback() {\n*!*\n    setTimeout(() => alert(this.innerHTML)); // John (*)\n*/!*\n  }\n\n});\n</script>\n\n*!*\n<user-info>John</user-info>\n*/!*\n```\n\nNow the `alert` in line `(*)` shows \"John\", as we run it asynchronously, after the HTML parsing is complete. We can process children if needed and finish the initialization.\n\nOn the other hand, this solution is also not perfect. If nested custom elements also use `setTimeout` to initialize themselves, then they queue up: the outer `setTimeout` triggers first, and then the inner one.\n\nSo the outer element finishes the initialization before the inner one.\n\nLet's demonstrate that on example:\n\n```html run height=0\n<script>\ncustomElements.define('user-info', class extends HTMLElement {\n  connectedCallback() {\n    alert(`${this.id} connected.`);\n    setTimeout(() => alert(`${this.id} initialized.`));\n  }\n});\n</script>\n\n*!*\n<user-info id=\"outer\">\n  <user-info id=\"inner\"></user-info>\n</user-info>\n*/!*\n```\n\nOutput order:\n\n1. outer connected.\n2. inner connected.\n3. outer initialized.\n4. inner initialized.\n\nWe can clearly see that the outer element finishes initialization `(3)` before the inner one `(4)`.\n\nThere's no built-in callback that triggers after nested elements are ready. If needed, we can implement such thing on our own. For instance, inner elements can dispatch events like `initialized`, and outer ones can listen and react on them.\n\n## Customized built-in elements\n\nNew elements that we create, such as `<time-formatted>`, don't have any associated semantics. They are unknown to search engines, and accessibility devices can't handle them.\n\nBut such things can be important. E.g, a search engine would be interested to know that we actually show a time. And if we're making a special kind of button, why not reuse the existing `<button>` functionality?\n\nWe can extend and customize built-in HTML elements by inheriting from their classes.\n\nFor example, buttons are instances of `HTMLButtonElement`, let's build upon it.\n\n1. Extend `HTMLButtonElement` with our class:\n\n    ```js\n    class HelloButton extends HTMLButtonElement { /* custom element methods */ }\n    ```\n\n2. Provide an third argument to `customElements.define`, that specifies the tag:\n    ```js\n    customElements.define('hello-button', HelloButton, *!*{extends: 'button'}*/!*);\n    ```    \n\n    There may be different tags that share the same DOM-class, that's why specifying `extends` is needed.\n\n3. At the end, to use our custom element, insert a regular `<button>` tag, but add `is=\"hello-button\"` to it:\n    ```html\n    <button is=\"hello-button\">...</button>\n    ```\n\nHere's a full example:\n\n```html run autorun=\"no-epub\"\n<script>\n// The button that says \"hello\" on click\nclass HelloButton extends HTMLButtonElement {\n*!*\n  constructor() {\n*/!*\n    super();\n    this.addEventListener('click', () => alert(\"Hello!\"));\n  }\n}\n\n*!*\ncustomElements.define('hello-button', HelloButton, {extends: 'button'});\n*/!*\n</script>\n\n*!*\n<button is=\"hello-button\">Click me</button>\n*/!*\n\n*!*\n<button is=\"hello-button\" disabled>Disabled</button>\n*/!*\n```\n\nOur new button extends the built-in one. So it keeps the same styles and standard features like `disabled` attribute.\n\n## References\n\n- HTML Living Standard: <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#custom-elements>.\n- Compatiblity: <https://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elements>.\n\n## Summary\n\nCustom elements can be of two types:\n\n1. \"Autonomous\" -- new tags, extending `HTMLElement`.\n\n    Definition scheme:\n\n    ```js\n    class MyElement extends HTMLElement {\n      constructor() { super(); /* ... */ }\n      connectedCallback() { /* ... */ }\n      disconnectedCallback() { /* ... */  }\n      static get observedAttributes() { return [/* ... */]; }\n      attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue) { /* ... */ }\n      adoptedCallback() { /* ... */ }\n     }\n    customElements.define('my-element', MyElement);\n    /* <my-element> */\n    ```\n\n2. \"Customized built-in elements\" -- extensions of existing elements.\n\n    Requires one more `.define` argument, and `is=\"...\"` in HTML:\n    ```js\n    class MyButton extends HTMLButtonElement { /*...*/ }\n    customElements.define('my-button', MyElement, {extends: 'button'});\n    /* <button is=\"my-button\"> */\n    ```\n\nCustom elements are well-supported among browsers.

        "content": "\n\nShadow DOM serves for encapsulation. It allows a component to have its very own \"shadow\" DOM tree, that can't be accidentally accessed from the main document, may have local style rules, and more.\n\n## Built-in shadow DOM\n\nDid you ever think how complex browser controls are created and styled?\n\nSuch as `<input type=\"range\">`:\n\n<p>\n<input type=\"range\">\n</p>\n\nThe browser uses DOM/CSS internally to draw them. That DOM structure is normally hidden from us, but we can see it in developer tools. E.g. in Chrome, we need to enable in Dev Tools \"Show user agent shadow DOM\" option.\n\nThen `<input type=\"range\">` looks like this:\n\n![](shadow-dom-range.png)\n\nWhat you see under `#shadow-root` is called \"shadow DOM\".\n\nWe can't get built-in shadow DOM elements by regular JavaScript calls or selectors. These are not regular children, but a powerful encapsulation technique.\n\nIn the example above, we can see a useful attribute `pseudo`. It's non-standard, exists for historical reasons. We can use it style subelements with CSS, like this:\n\n```html run autorun\n<style>\n/* make the slider track red */\ninput::-webkit-slider-runnable-track {\n  background: red;\n}\n</style>\n\n<input type=\"range\">\n```\n\nOnce again, `pseudo` is a non-standard attribute. Chronologically, browsers first started to experiment with internal DOM structures to implement controls, and then, after time, shadow DOM was standardized to allow us, developers, to do the similar thing.\n\nFurther on, we'll use the modern shadow DOM standard, covered by [DOM spec](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#shadow-trees) other related specifications.\n\n## Shadow tree\n\nA DOM element can have two types of DOM subtrees:\n\n1. Light tree -- a regular DOM subtree, made of HTML children. All subtrees that we've seen in previous chapters were \"light\".\n2. Shadow tree -- a hidden DOM subtree, not reflected in HTML, hidden from prying eyes.\n\nIf an element has both, then the browser renders only the shadow tree. But we can setup a kind of composition between shadow and light trees as well. We'll see the details later in the chapter <info:slots-composition>.\n\nShadow tree can be used in Custom Elements to hide component internals and apply component-local styles.\n\nFor example, this `<show-hello>` element hides its internal DOM in shadow tree:\n\n```html run autorun height=60\n<script>\ncustomElements.define('show-hello', class extends HTMLElement {\n  connectedCallback() {\n    const shadow = this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n    shadow.innerHTML = `<p>\n      Hello, ${this.getAttribute('name')}\n    </p>`;\n  }  \n});\n</script>\n\n<show-hello name=\"John\"></show-hello>\n```\n\nThat's how the resulting DOM looks in Chrome dev tools, all the content is under \"#shadow-root\":\n\n![](shadow-dom-say-hello.png)\n\nFirst, the call to `elem.attachShadow({mode: …})` creates a shadow tree.\n\nThere are two limitations:\n1. We can create only one shadow root per element.\n2. The `elem` must be either a custom element, or one of: \"article\", \"aside\", \"blockquote\", \"body\", \"div\", \"footer\", \"h1..h6\", \"header\", \"main\" \"nav\", \"p\", \"section\", or \"span\". Other elements, like `<img>`, can't host shadow tree.\n\nThe `mode` option sets the encapsulation level. It must have any of two values:\n- `\"open\"` -- the shadow root is available as `elem.shadowRoot`.\n\n    Any code is able to access the shadow tree of `elem`.   \n- `\"closed\"` -- `elem.shadowRoot` is always `null`.\n\n    We can only access the shadow DOM by the reference returned by `attachShadow` (and probably hidden inside a class). Browser-native shadow trees, such as  `<input type=\"range\">`, are closed. There's no way to access them.\n\nThe [shadow root](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#shadowroot), returned by `attachShadow`, is like an element: we can use `innerHTML` or DOM methods, such as `append`, to populate it.\n\nThe element with a shadow root is called a \"shadow tree host\", and is available as the shadow root `host` property:\n\n```js\n// assuming {mode: \"open\"}, otherwise elem.shadowRoot is null\nalert(elem.shadowRoot.host === elem); // true\n```\n\n## Encapsulation\n\nShadow DOM is strongly delimited from the main document:\n\n1. Shadow DOM elements are not visible to `querySelector` from the light DOM. In particular,  Shadow DOM elements may have ids that conflict with those in the light DOM. They must be unique only within the shadow tree.\n2. Shadow DOM has own stylesheets. Style rules from the outer DOM don't get applied.\n\nFor example:\n\n```html run untrusted height=40\n<style>\n*!*\n  /* document style won't apply to the shadow tree inside #elem (1) */\n*/!*\n  p { color: red; }\n</style>\n\n<div id=\"elem\"></div>\n\n<script>\n  elem.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n*!*\n    // shadow tree has its own style (2)\n*/!*\n  elem.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `\n    <style> p { font-weight: bold; } </style>\n    <p>Hello, John!</p>\n  `;\n\n*!*\n  // <p> is only visible from queries inside the shadow tree (3)\n*/!*\n  alert(document.querySelectorAll('p').length); // 0\n  alert(elem.shadowRoot.querySelectorAll('p').length); // 1\n</script>  \n```\n\n1. The style from the document does not affect the shadow tree.\n2. ...But the style from the inside works.\n3. To get elements in shadow tree, we must query from inside the tree.\n\n## References\n\n- DOM: <https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#shadow-trees>\n- Compatibility: <https://caniuse.com/#feat=shadowdomv1>\n- Shadow DOM is mentioned in many other specifications, e.g. [DOM Parsing](https://w3c.github.io/DOM-Parsing/#the-innerhtml-mixin) specifies that shadow root has `innerHTML`.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nShadow DOM is a way to create a component-local DOM.\n\n1. `shadowRoot = elem.attachShadow({mode: open|closed})` -- creates shadow DOM for `elem`. If `mode=\"open\"`, then it's accessible as `elem.shadowRoot` property.\n2. We can populate `shadowRoot` using `innerHTML` or other DOM methods.\n\nShadow DOM elements:\n- Have their own ids space,\n- Invisible to JavaScript selectors from the main document, such as `querySelector`,\n- Use styles only from the shadow tree, not from the main document.\n\nShadow DOM, if exists, is rendered by the browser instead of so-called \"light DOM\" (regular children). In the chapter <info:slots-composition> we'll see how to compose them.",

        "content": "\n\nA built-in `<template>` element serves as a storage for HTML markup templates. The browser ignores it contents, only checks for syntax validity, but we can access and use it in JavaScript, to create other elements.\n\nIn theory, we could create any invisible element somewhere in HTML for HTML markup storage purposes. What's special about `<template>`?\n\nFirst, its content can be any valid HTML, even if it normally requires a proper enclosing tag.\n\nFor example, we can put there a table row `<tr>`:\n```html\n<template>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Contents</td>\n  </tr>\n</template>\n```\n\nUsually, if we try to put `<tr>` inside, say, a `<div>`, the browser detects the invalid DOM structure and \"fixes\" it, adds `<table>` around. That's not what we want. On the other hand, `<template>` keeps exactly what we place there.\n\nWe can put styles and scripts into `<template>` as well:\n\n```html\n<template>\n  <style>\n    p { font-weight: bold; }\n  </style>\n  <script>\n    alert(\"Hello\");\n  </script>\n</template>\n```\n\nThe browser considers `<template>` content \"out of the document\": styles are not applied, scripts are not executed, `<video autoplay>` is not run, etc.\n\nThe content becomes live (styles apply, scripts run etc) when we insert it into the document.\n\n## Inserting template\n\nThe template content is available in its `content` property as a [DocumentFragment](info:modifying-document#document-fragment) -- a special type of DOM node.\n\nWe can treat it as any other DOM node, except one special property: when we insert it somewhere, its children are inserted instead.\n\nFor example:\n\n```html run\n<template id=\"tmpl\">\n  <script>\n    alert(\"Hello\");\n  </script>\n  <div class=\"message\">Hello, world!</div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n  let elem = document.createElement('div');\n\n*!*\n  // Clone the template content to reuse it multiple times\n  elem.append(tmpl.content.cloneNode(true));\n*/!*\n\n  document.body.append(elem);\n  // Now the script from <template> runs\n</script>\n```\n\nLet's rewrite a Shadow DOM example from the previous chapter using `<template>`:\n\n```html run untrusted autorun=\"no-epub\" height=60\n<template id=\"tmpl\">\n  <style> p { font-weight: bold; } </style>\n  <p id=\"message\"></p>\n</template>\n\n<div id=\"elem\">Click me</div>\n\n<script>\n  elem.onclick = function() {\n    elem.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n\n*!*\n    elem.shadowRoot.append(tmpl.content.cloneNode(true)); // (*)\n*/!*\n\n    elem.shadowRoot.getElementById('message').innerHTML = \"Hello from the shadows!\";\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\nIn the line `(*)` when we clone and insert `tmpl.content`, as its `DocumentFragment`, its children (`<style>`, `<p>`) are inserted instead.\n\nThey form the shadow DOM:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"elem\">\n  #shadow-root\n    <style> p { font-weight: bold; } </style>\n    <p id=\"message\"></p>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- `<template>` content can be any syntactically correct HTML.\n- `<template>` content is considered \"out of the document\", so it doesn't affect anything.\n- We can access `template.content` from JavaScript, clone it to reuse in a new component.\n\nThe `<template>` tag is quite unique, because:\n\n- The browser checks HTML syntax inside it (as opposed to using a template string inside a script).\n- ...But still allows use of any top-level HTML tags, even those that don't make sense without proper wrappers (e.g. `<tr>`).\n- The content becomes interactive: scripts run, `<video autoplay>` plays etc, when inserted into the document.\n\nThe `<template>` element does not feature any iteration mechanisms, data binding or variable substitutions, but we can implement those on top of it.",

And a `<custom-menu>` may expect menu items.\n\nThe code that makes use of `<custom-menu>` can look like this:\n\n```html\n<custom-menu>\n  <title>Candy menu</title>\n  <item>Lollipop</item>\n  <item>Fruit Toast</item>\n  <item>Cup Cake</item>\n</custom-menu>\n```\n\n...Then our component should render it properly, as a nice menu with given title and items, handle menu events, etc.\n\nHow to implement it?\n\nWe could try to analyze the element content and dynamically copy-rearrange DOM nodes. That's possible, but if we're moving elements to shadow DOM, then CSS styles from the document do not apply in there, so the visual styling may be lost. Also that requires some coding.\n\nLuckily, we don't have to. Shadow DOM supports `<slot>` elements, that are automatically filled by the content from light DOM.\n\n## Named slots\n\nLet's see how slots work on a simple example.\n\nHere, `<user-card>` shadow DOM provides two slots, filled from light DOM:\n\n```html run autorun=\"no-epub\" untrusted height=80\n<script>\ncustomElements.define('user-card', class extends HTMLElement {\n  connectedCallback() {\n    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `\n      <div>Name:\n*!*\n        <slot name=\"username\"></slot>\n*/!*\n      </div>\n      <div>Birthday:\n*!*\n        <slot name=\"birthday\"></slot>\n*/!*\n      </div>\n    `;\n  }\n});\n</script>\n\n<user-card>\n  <span *!*slot=\"username\"*/!*>John Smith</span>\n  <span *!*slot=\"birthday\"*/!*>01.01.2001</span>\n</user-card>\n```\n\nIn the shadow DOM, `<slot name=\"X\">` defines an \"insertion point\", a place where elements with `slot=\"X\"` are rendered.\n\nThen the browser performs \"composition\": it takes elements from the light DOM and renders them in corresponding slots of the shadow DOM. At the end, we have exactly what we want -- a component that can be filled with data.\n\nHere's the DOM structure after the script, not taking composition into account:\n\n```html\n<user-card>\n  #shadow-root\n    <div>Name:\n      <slot name=\"username\"></slot>\n    </div>\n    <div>Birthday:\n      <slot name=\"birthday\"></slot>\n    </div>\n  <span slot=\"username\">John Smith</span>\n  <span slot=\"birthday\">01.01.2001</span>\n</user-card>\n```\n\nWe created the shadow DOM, so here it is, under `#shadow-root`. Now the element has both light and shadow DOM.\n\nFor rendering purposes, for each `<slot name=\"...\">` in shadow DOM, the browser looks for `slot=\"...\"` with the same name in the light DOM. These elements are rendered inside the slots:\n\n![](shadow-dom-user-card.svg)\n\nThe result is called \"flattened\" DOM:\n\n```html\n<user-card>\n  #shadow-root\n    <div>Name:\n      <slot name=\"username\">\n        <!-- slotted element is inserted into the slot -->\n        <span slot=\"username\">John Smith</span>\n      </slot>\n    </div>\n    <div>Birthday:\n      <slot name=\"birthday\">\n        <span slot=\"birthday\">01.01.2001</span>\n      </slot>\n    </div>\n</user-card>\n```\n\n...But the flattened DOM exists only for rendering and event-handling purposes. It's kind of \"virtual\". That's how things are shown. But the nodes in the document are actually not moved around!\n\nThat can be easily checked if we run `querySelectorAll`: nodes are still at their places.\n\n```js\n// light DOM <span> nodes are still at the same place, under `<user-card>`\nalert( document.querySelectorAll('user-card span').length ); // 2\n```\n\nSo, the flattened DOM is derived from shadow DOM by inserting slots. The browser renders it and uses for style inheritance, event propagation (more about that later). But JavaScript still sees the document \"as is\", before flattening.\n\n````warn header=\"Only top-level children may have slot=\\\"...\\\" attribute\"\nThe `slot=\"...\"` attribute is only valid for direct children of the shadow host (in our example, `<user-card>` element). For nested elements it's ignored.\n\nFor example, the second `<span>` here is ignored (as it's not a top-level child of `<user-card>`):\n```html\n<user-card>\n  <span slot=\"username\">John Smith</span>\n  <div>\n    <!-- invalid slot, must be direct child of user-card -->\n    <span slot=\"birthday\">01.01.2001</span>\n  </div>\n</user-card>\n```\n````\n\nIf there are multiple elements in light DOM with the same slot name, they are appended into the slot, one after another.\n\nFor example, this:\n```html\n<user-card>\n  <span slot=\"username\">John</span>\n  <span slot=\"username\">Smith</span>\n</user-card>\n```\n\nGives this flattened DOM with two elements in `<slot name=\"username\">`:\n\n```html\n<user-card>\n  #shadow-root\n    <div>Name:\n      <slot name=\"username\">\n        <span slot=\"username\">John</span>\n        <span slot=\"username\">Smith</span>\n      </slot>\n    </div>\n    <div>Birthday:\n      <slot name=\"birthday\"></slot>\n    </div>\n</user-card>\n```\n\n## Slot fallback content\n\nIf we put something inside a `<slot>`, it becomes the fallback, \"default\" content. The browser shows it if there's no corresponding filler in light DOM.\n\nFor example, in this piece of shadow DOM, `Anonymous` renders if there's no `slot=\"username\"` in light DOM.\n\n```html\n<div>Name:\n  <slot name=\"username\">Anonymous</slot>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Default slot: first unnamed\n\nThe first `<slot>` in shadow DOM that doesn't have a name is a \"default\" slot. It gets all nodes from the light DOM that aren't slotted elsewhere.\n\nFor example, let's add the default slot to our `<user-card>` that shows all unslotted information about the user:\n\n```html run autorun=\"no-epub\" untrusted height=140\n<script>\ncustomElements.define('user-card', class extends HTMLElement {\n  connectedCallback() {\n    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `\n    <div>Name:\n      <slot name=\"username\"></slot>\n    </div>\n    <div>Birthday:\n      <slot name=\"birthday\"></slot>\n    </div>\n    <fieldset>\n      <legend>Other information</legend>\n*!*\n      <slot></slot>\n*/!*\n    </fieldset>\n    `;\n  }\n});\n</script>\n\n<user-card>\n*!*\n  <div>I like to swim.</div>\n*/!*\n  <span slot=\"username\">John Smith</span>\n  <span slot=\"birthday\">01.01.2001</span>\n*!*\n  <div>...And play volleyball too!</div>\n*/!*\n</user-card>\n```\n\nAll the unslotted light DOM content gets into the \"Other information\" fieldset.\n\nElements are appended to a slot one after another, so both unslotted pieces of information are in the default slot together.\n\nThe flattened DOM looks like this:\n\n```html\n<user-card>\n  #shadow-root\n    <div>Name:\n      <slot name=\"username\">\n        <span slot=\"username\">John Smith</span>\n      </slot>\n    </div>\n    <div>Birthday:\n      <slot name=\"birthday\">\n        <span slot=\"birthday\">01.01.2001</span>\n      </slot>\n    </div>\n    <fieldset>\n      <legend>About me</legend>\n*!*\n      <slot>\n        <div>Hello</div>\n        <div>I am John!</div>\n      </slot>\n*/!*\n    </fieldset>\n</user-card>\n```\n\n## Menu example\n\nNow let's back to `<custom-menu>`, mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.\n\nWe can use slots to distribute elements.\n\nHere's the markup for `<custom-menu>`:\n\n```html\n<custom-menu>\n  <span slot=\"title\">Candy menu</span>\n  <li slot=\"item\">Lollipop</li>\n  <li slot=\"item\">Fruit Toast</li>\n  <li slot=\"item\">Cup Cake</li>\n</custom-menu>\n```\n\nThe shadow DOM template with proper slots:\n\n```html\n<template id=\"tmpl\">\n  <style> /* menu styles */ </style>\n  <div class=\"menu\">\n    <slot name=\"title\"></slot>\n    <ul><slot name=\"item\"></slot></ul>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n1. `<span slot=\"title\">` goes into `<slot name=\"title\">`.\n2. There are many `<li slot=\"item\">` in the template, but only one `<slot name=\"item\">` in the template. So all such `<li slot=\"item\">` are appended to `<slot name=\"item\">` one after another, thus forming the list.\n\nThe flattened DOM becomes:\n\n```html\n<custom-menu>\n  #shadow-root\n    <style> /* menu styles */ </style>\n    <div class=\"menu\">\n      <slot name=\"title\">\n        <span slot=\"title\">Candy menu</span>\n      </slot>\n      <ul>\n        <slot name=\"item\">\n          <li slot=\"item\">Lollipop</li>\n          <li slot=\"item\">Fruit Toast</li>\n          <li slot=\"item\">Cup Cake</li>\n        </slot>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n</custom-menu>\n```\n\nOne might notice that, in a valid DOM, `<li>` must be a direct child of `<ul>`. But that's flattened DOM, it describes how the component is rendered, such thing happens naturally here.\n\nWe just need to add a `click` handler to open/close the list, and the `<custom-menu>` is ready:\n\n```js\ncustomElements.define('custom-menu', class extends HTMLElement {\n  connectedCallback() {\n    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n\n    // tmpl is the shadow DOM template (above)\n    this.shadowRoot.append( tmpl.content.cloneNode(true) );\n\n    // we can't select light DOM nodes, so let's handle clicks on the slot\n    this.shadowRoot.querySelector('slot[name=\"title\"]').onclick = () => {\n      // open/close the menu\n      this.shadowRoot.querySelector('.menu').classList.toggle('closed');\n    };\n  }\n});\n```\n\nHere's the full demo:\n\n[iframe src=\"menu\" height=140 edit]\n\nOf course, we can add more functionality to it: events, methods and so on.\n\n## Updating slots\n\nWhat if the outer code wants to add/remove menu items dynamically?\n\n**The browser monitors slots and updates the rendering if slotted elements are added/removed.**\n\nAlso, as light DOM nodes are not copied, but just rendered in slots, the changes inside them immediately become visible.\n\nSo we don't have to do anything to update rendering. But if the component code wants to know about slot changes, then `slotchange` event is available.\n\nFor example, here the menu item is inserted dynamically after 1 second, and the title changes after 2 seconds:\n\n```html run untrusted height=80\n<custom-menu id=\"menu\">\n  <span slot=\"title\">Candy menu</span>\n</custom-menu>\n\n<script>\ncustomElements.define('custom-menu', class extends HTMLElement {\n  connectedCallback() {\n    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `<div class=\"menu\">\n      <slot name=\"title\"></slot>\n      <ul><slot name=\"item\"></slot></ul>\n    </div>`;\n\n    // shadowRoot can't have event handlers, so using the first child\n    this.shadowRoot.firstElementChild.addEventListener('slotchange',\n      e => alert(\"slotchange: \" + e.target.name)\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  menu.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeEnd', '<li slot=\"item\">Lollipop</li>')\n}, 1000);\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  menu.querySelector('[slot=\"title\"]').innerHTML = \"New menu\";\n}, 2000);\n</script>\n```\n\nThe menu rendering updates each time without our intervention.\n\nThere are two `slotchange` events here:\n\n1. At initialization:\n\n    `slotchange: title` triggers immediately, as the `slot=\"title\"` from the light DOM gets into the corresponding slot.\n2. After 1 second:\n\n    `slotchange: item` triggers, when a new `<li slot=\"item\">` is added.\n\nPlease note: there's no `slotchange` event after 2 seconds, when the content of `slot=\"title\"` is modified. That's because there's no slot change. We modify the content inside the slotted element, that's another thing.\n\nIf we'd like to track internal modifications of light DOM from JavaScript, that's also possible using a more generic mechanism: [MutationObserver](info:mutation-observer).\n\n## Slot API\n\nFinally, let's mention the slot-related JavaScript methods.\n\nAs we've seen before, JavaScript looks at the \"real\" DOM, without flattening. But, if the shadow tree has `{mode: 'open'}`, then we can figure out which elements assigned to a slot and, vise-versa, the slot by the element inside it:\n\n- `node.assignedSlot` -- returns the `<slot>` element that the `node` is assigned to.\n- `slot.assignedNodes({flatten: true/false})` -- DOM nodes, assigned to the slot. The `flatten` option is `false` by default. If explicitly set to `true`, then it looks more deeply into the flattened DOM, returning nested slots in case of nested components and the fallback content if no node assigned.\n- `slot.assignedElements({flatten: true/false})` -- DOM elements, assigned to the slot (same as above, but only element nodes).\n\nThese methods are useful when we need not just show the slotted content, but also track it in JavaScript.\n\nFor example, if `<custom-menu>` component wants to know, what it shows, then it could track `slotchange` and get the items from `slot.assignedElements`:\n\n```html run untrusted height=120\n<custom-menu id=\"menu\">\n  <span slot=\"title\">Candy menu</span>\n  <li slot=\"item\">Lollipop</li>\n  <li slot=\"item\">Fruit Toast</li>\n</custom-menu>\n\n<script>\ncustomElements.define('custom-menu', class extends HTMLElement {\n  items = []\n\n  connectedCallback() {\n    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `<div class=\"menu\">\n      <slot name=\"title\"></slot>\n      <ul><slot name=\"item\"></slot></ul>\n    </div>`;\n\n    // slottable is added/removed/replaced\n*!*\n    this.shadowRoot.firstElementChild.addEventListener('slotchange', e => {\n      let slot = e.target;\n      if (slot.name == 'item') {\n        this.items = slot.assignedElements().map(elem => elem.textContent);\n        alert(\"Items: \" + this.items);\n      }\n    });\n*/!*\n  }\n});\n\n// items update after 1 second\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  menu.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeEnd', '<li slot=\"item\">Cup Cake</li>')\n}, 1000);\n</script>\n```\n\n\n## Summary\n\nUsually, if an element has shadow DOM, then its light DOM is not displayed. Slots allow to show elements from light DOM in specified places of shadow DOM.\n\nThere are two kinds of slots:\n\n- Named slots: `<slot name=\"X\">...</slot>` -- gets light children with `slot=\"X\"`.\n- Default slot: the first `<slot>` without a name (subsequent unnamed slots are ignored) -- gets unslotted light children.\n- If there are many elements for the same slot -- they are appended one after another.\n- The content of `<slot>` element is used as a fallback. It's shown if there are no light children for the slot.\n\nThe process of rendering slotted elements inside their slots is called \"composition\". The result is called a \"flattened DOM\".\n\nComposition does not really move nodes, from JavaScript point of view the DOM is still same.\n\nJavaScript can access slots using methods:\n- `slot.assignedNodes/Elements()` -- returns nodes/elements inside the `slot`.\n- `node.assignedSlot` -- the reverse meethod, returns slot by a node.\n\nIf we'd like to know what we're showing, we can track slot contents using:\n- `slotchange` event -- triggers the first time a slot is filled, and on any add/remove/replace operation of the slotted element, but not its children. The slot is `event.target`.\n- [MutationObserver](info:mutation-observer) to go deeper into slot content, watch changes inside it.\n\nNow, as we know how to show elements from light DOM in shadow DOM, let's see how to style them properly. The basic rule is that shadow elements are styled inside, and light elements -- outside, but there are notable exceptions.\n\nWe'll see the details in the next chapter.",

But there are few exceptions.\n\n## :host\n\nThe `:host` selector allows to select the shadow host (the element containing the shadow tree).\n\nFor instance, we're making `<custom-dialog>` element that should be centered. For that we need to style the `<custom-dialog>` element itself.\n\nThat's exactly what `:host` does:\n\n```html run autorun=\"no-epub\" untrusted height=80\n<template id=\"tmpl\">\n  <style>\n    /* the style will be applied from inside to the custom-dialog element */\n    :host {\n      position: fixed;\n      left: 50%;\n      top: 50%;\n      transform: translate(-50%, -50%);\n      display: inline-block;\n      border: 1px solid red;\n      padding: 10px;\n    }\n  </style>\n  <slot></slot>\n</template>\n\n<script>\ncustomElements.define('custom-dialog', class extends HTMLElement {\n  connectedCallback() {\n    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'}).append(tmpl.content.cloneNode(true));\n  }\n});\n</script>\n\n<custom-dialog>\n  Hello!\n</custom-dialog>\n```\n\n## Cascading\n\nThe shadow host (`<custom-dialog>` itself) resides in the light DOM, so it's affected by document CSS rules.\n\nIf there's a property styled both in `:host` locally, and in the document, then the document style takes precedence.\n\nFor instance, if in the document we had:\n```html\n<style>\ncustom-dialog {\n  padding: 0;\n}\n</style>\n```\n...Then the `<custom-dialog>` would be without padding.\n\nIt's very convenient, as we can setup \"default\" component styles in its `:host` rule, and then easily override them in the document.\n\nThe exception is when a local property is labelled `!important`, for such properties, local styles take precedence.\n\n\n## :host(selector)\n\nSame as `:host`, but applied only if the shadow host matches the `selector`.\n\nFor example, we'd like to center the `<custom-dialog>` only if it has `centered` attribute:\n\n```html run autorun=\"no-epub\" untrusted height=80\n<template id=\"tmpl\">\n  <style>\n*!*\n    :host([centered]) {\n*/!*\n      position: fixed;\n      left: 50%;\n      top: 50%;\n      transform: translate(-50%, -50%);\n      border-color: blue;\n    }\n\n    :host {\n      display: inline-block;\n      border: 1px solid red;\n      padding: 10px;\n    }\n  </style>\n  <slot></slot>\n</template>\n\n<script>\ncustomElements.define('custom-dialog', class extends HTMLElement {\n  connectedCallback() {\n    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'}).append(tmpl.content.cloneNode(true));\n  }\n});\n</script>\n\n\n<custom-dialog centered>\n  Centered!\n</custom-dialog>\n\n<custom-dialog>\n  Not centered.\n</custom-dialog>\n```\n\nNow the additional centering styles are only applied to the first dialog: `<custom-dialog centered>`.\n\n## :host-context(selector)\n\nSame as `:host`, but applied only if the shadow host or any of its ancestors in the outer document matches the `selector`.\n\nE.g. `:host-context(.dark-theme)` matches only if there's `dark-theme` class on `<custom-dialog>` on anywhere above it:\n\n```html\n<body class=\"dark-theme\">\n  <!--\n    :host-context(.dark-theme) applies to custom-dialogs inside .dark-theme\n  -->\n  <custom-dialog>...</custom-dialog>\n</body>\n```\n\nTo summarize, we can use `:host`-family of selectors to style the main element of the component, depending on the context. These styles (unless `!important`) can be overridden by the document.\n\n## Styling slotted content\n\nNow let's consider the situation with slots.\n\nSlotted elements come from light DOM, so they use document styles. Local styles do not affect slotted content.\n\nIn the example below, slotted `<span>` is bold, as per document style, but does not take `background` from the local style:\n```html run autorun=\"no-epub\" untrusted height=80\n<style>\n*!*\n  span { font-weight: bold }\n*/!*\n</style>\n\n<user-card>\n  <div slot=\"username\">*!*<span>John Smith</span>*/!*</div>\n</user-card>\n\n<script>\ncustomElements.define('user-card', class extends HTMLElement {\n  connectedCallback() {\n    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `\n      <style>\n*!*\n      span { background: red; }\n*/!*\n      </style>\n      Name: <slot name=\"username\"></slot>\n    `;\n  }\n});\n</script>\n```\n\nThe result is bold, but not red.\n\nIf we'd like to style slotted elements in our component, there are two choices.\n\nFirst, we can style the `<slot>` itself and rely on CSS inheritance:\n\n```html run autorun=\"no-epub\" untrusted height=80\n<user-card>\n  <div slot=\"username\">*!*<span>John Smith</span>*/!*</div>\n</user-card>\n\n<script>\ncustomElements.define('user-card', class extends HTMLElement {\n  connectedCallback() {\n    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `\n      <style>\n*!*\n      slot[name=\"username\"] { font-weight: bold; }\n*/!*\n      </style>\n      Name: <slot name=\"username\"></slot>\n    `;\n  }\n});\n</script>\n```\n\nHere `<p>John Smith</p>` becomes bold, because CSS inheritance is in effect between the `<slot>` and its contents. But in CSS itself not all properties are inherited.\n\nAnother option is to use `::slotted(selector)` pseudo-class. It matches elements based on two conditions:\n\n1. That's a slotted element, that comes from the light DOM. Slot name doesn't matter. Just any slotted element, but only the element itself, not its children.\n2. The element matches the `selector`.\n\nIn our example, `::slotted(div)` selects exactly `<div slot=\"username\">`, but not its children:\n\n```html run autorun=\"no-epub\" untrusted height=80\n<user-card>\n  <div slot=\"username\">\n    <div>John Smith</div>\n  </div>\n</user-card>\n\n<script>\ncustomElements.define('user-card', class extends HTMLElement {\n  connectedCallback() {\n    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `\n      <style>\n*!*\n      ::slotted(div) { border: 1px solid red; }\n*/!*\n      </style>\n      Name: <slot name=\"username\"></slot>\n    `;\n  }\n});\n</script>\n```\n\nPlease note, `::slotted` selector can't descend any further into the slot. These selectors are invalid:\n\n```css\n::slotted(div span) {\n  /* our slotted <div> does not match this */\n}\n\n::slotted(div) p {\n  /* can't go inside light DOM */\n}\n```\n\nAlso, `::slotted` can only be used in CSS. We can't use it in `querySelector`.\n\n## CSS hooks with custom properties\n\nHow do we style internal elements of a component from the main document?\n\nSelectors like `:host` apply rules to `<custom-dialog>` element or `<user-card>`, but how to style shadow DOM elements inside them?\n\nThere's no selector that can directly affect shadow DOM styles from the document. But just as we expose methods to interact with our component, we can expose CSS variables (custom CSS properties) to style it.\n\n**Custom CSS properties exist on all levels, both in light and shadow.**\n\nFor example, in shadow DOM we can use `--user-card-field-color` CSS variable to  style fields, and the outer document can set its value:\n\n```html\n<style>\n  .field {\n    color: var(--user-card-field-color, black);\n    /* if --user-card-field-color is not defined, use black color */\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"field\">Name: <slot name=\"username\"></slot></div>\n<div class=\"field\">Birthday: <slot name=\"birthday\"></slot></div>\n</style>\n```\n\nThen, we can declare this property in the outer document for `<user-card>`:\n\n```css\nuser-card {\n  --user-card-field-color: green;\n}\n```\n\nCustom CSS properties pierce through shadow DOM, they are visible everywhere, so the inner `.field` rule will make use of it.\n\nHere's the full example:\n\n```html run autorun=\"no-epub\" untrusted height=80\n<style>\n*!*\n  user-card {\n    --user-card-field-color: green;\n  }\n*/!*\n</style>\n\n<template id=\"tmpl\">\n  <style>\n*!*\n    .field {\n      color: var(--user-card-field-color, black);\n    }\n*/!*\n  </style>\n  <div class=\"field\">Name: <slot name=\"username\"></slot></div>\n  <div class=\"field\">Birthday: <slot name=\"birthday\"></slot></div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\ncustomElements.define('user-card', class extends HTMLElement {\n  connectedCallback() {\n    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n    this.shadowRoot.append(document.getElementById('tmpl').content.cloneNode(true));\n  }\n});\n</script>\n\n<user-card>\n  <span slot=\"username\">John Smith</span>\n  <span slot=\"birthday\">01.01.2001</span>\n</user-card>\n```\n\n\n\n## Summary\n\nShadow DOM can include styles, such as `<style>` or `<link rel=\"stylesheet\">`.\n\nLocal styles can affect:\n- shadow tree,\n- shadow host with `:host`-family pseudoclasses,\n- slotted elements (coming from light DOM), `::slotted(selector)` allows to select  slotted elements themselves, but not their children.\n\nDocument styles can affect:\n- shadow host (as it lives in the outer document)\n- slotted elements and their contents (as that's also in the outer document)\n\nWhen CSS properties conflict, normally document styles have precedence, unless the property is labelled as `!important`. Then local styles have precedence.\n\nCSS custom properties pierce through shadow DOM. They are used as \"hooks\" to style the component:\n\n1. The component uses a custom CSS property to style key elements, such as `var(--component-name-title, <default value>)`.\n2. Component author publishes these properties for developers, they are same important as other public component methods.\n3. When a developer wants to style a title, they assign `--component-name-title` CSS property for the shadow host or above.\n4. Profit!",

        "content": "\n\nThe idea behind shadow tree is to encapsulate internal implementation details of a component.\n\nLet's say, a click event happens inside a shadow DOM of `<user-card>` component. But scripts in the main document have no idea about the shadow DOM internals, especially if the component comes from a 3rd-party library.  \n\nSo, to keep the details encapsulated, the browser *retargets* the event.\n\n**Events that happen in shadow DOM have the host element as the target, when caught outside of the component.**\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```html run autorun=\"no-epub\" untrusted height=60\n<user-card></user-card>\n\n<script>\ncustomElements.define('user-card', class extends HTMLElement {\n  connectedCallback() {\n    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `<p>\n      <button>Click me</button>\n    </p>`;\n    this.shadowRoot.firstElementChild.onclick =\n      e => alert(\"Inner target: \" + e.target.tagName);\n  }\n});\n\ndocument.onclick =\n  e => alert(\"Outer target: \" + e.target.tagName);\n</script>\n```\n\nIf you click on the button, the messages are:\n\n1. Inner target: `BUTTON` -- internal event handler gets the correct target, the element inside shadow DOM.\n2. Outer target: `USER-CARD` -- document event handler gets shadow host as the target.\n\nEvent retargeting is a great thing to have, because the outer document doesn't have to know  about component internals. From its point of view, the event happened on `<user-card>`.\n\n**Retargeting does not occur if the event occurs on a slotted element, that physically lives in the light DOM.**\n\nFor example, if a user clicks on `<span slot=\"username\">` in the example below, the event target is exactly this `span` element, for both shadow and light handlers:\n\n```html run autorun=\"no-epub\" untrusted height=60\n<user-card id=\"userCard\">\n*!*\n  <span slot=\"username\">John Smith</span>\n*/!*\n</user-card>\n\n<script>\ncustomElements.define('user-card', class extends HTMLElement {\n  connectedCallback() {\n    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `<div>\n      <b>Name:</b> <slot name=\"username\"></slot>\n    </div>`;\n\n    this.shadowRoot.firstElementChild.onclick =\n      e => alert(\"Inner target: \" + e.target.tagName);\n  }\n});\n\nuserCard.onclick = e => alert(`Outer target: ${e.target.tagName}`);\n</script>\n```\n\nIf a click happens on `\"John Smith\"`, for both inner and outer handlers the target is `<span slot=\"username\">`. That's an element from the light DOM, so no retargeting.\n\nOn the other hand, if the click occurs on an element originating from shadow DOM, e.g. on `<b>Name</b>`, then, as it bubbles out of the shadow DOM, its `event.target` is reset to `<user-card>`.\n\n## Bubbling, event.composedPath()\n\nFor purposes of event bubbling, flattened DOM is used.\n\nSo, if we have a slotted element, and an event occurs somewhere inside it, then it bubbles up to the `<slot>` and upwards.\n\nThe full path to the original event target, with all the shadow elements, can be obtained using `event.composedPath()`. As we can see from the name of the method, that path is taken after the composition.\n\nIn the example above, the flattened DOM is:\n\n```html\n<user-card id=\"userCard\">\n  #shadow-root\n    <div>\n      <b>Name:</b>\n      <slot name=\"username\">\n        <span slot=\"username\">John Smith</span>\n      </slot>\n    </div>\n</user-card>\n```\n\n\nSo, for a click on `<span slot=\"username\">`, a call to `event.composedPath()` returns an array: [`span`, `slot`, `div`, `shadow-root`, `user-card`, `body`, `html`, `document`, `window`]. That's exactly the parent chain from the target element in the flattened DOM, after the composition.\n\n```warn header=\"Shadow tree details are only provided for `{mode:'open'}` trees\"\nIf the shadow tree was created with `{mode: 'closed'}`, then the composed path starts from the host: `user-card` and upwards.\n\nThat's the similar principle as for other methods that work with shadow DOM. Internals of closed trees are completely hidden.\n```\n\n\n## event.composed\n\nMost events successfully bubble through a shadow DOM boundary. There are few events that do not.\n\nThis is governed by the `composed` event object property. If it's `true`, then the event does cross the boundary. Otherwise, it only can be caught from inside the shadow DOM.\n\nIf you take a look at [UI Events specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents), most events have `composed: true`:\n\n- `blur`, `focus`, `focusin`, `focusout`,\n- `click`, `dblclick`,\n- `mousedown`, `mouseup` `mousemove`, `mouseout`, `mouseover`,\n- `wheel`,\n- `beforeinput`, `input`, `keydown`, `keyup`.\n\nAll touch events and pointer events also have `composed: true`.\n\nThere are some events that have `composed: false` though:\n\n- `mouseenter`, `mouseleave` (they do not bubble at all),\n- `load`, `unload`, `abort`, `error`,\n- `select`,\n- `slotchange`.\n\nThese events can be caught only on elements within the same DOM, where the event target resides.\n\n## Custom events\n\nWhen we dispatch custom events, we need to set both `bubbles` and `composed` properties to `true` for it to bubble up and out of the component.\n\nFor example, here we create `div#inner` in the shadow DOM of `div#outer` and trigger two events on it. Only the one with `composed: true` makes it outside to the document:\n\n```html run untrusted height=0\n<div id=\"outer\"></div>\n\n<script>\nouter.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n\nlet inner = document.createElement('div');\nouter.shadowRoot.append(inner);\n\n/*\ndiv(id=outer)\n  #shadow-dom\n    div(id=inner)\n*/\n\ndocument.addEventListener('test', event => alert(event.detail));\n\ninner.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('test', {\n  bubbles: true,\n*!*\n  composed: true,\n*/!*\n  detail: \"composed\"\n}));\n\ninner.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('test', {\n  bubbles: true,\n*!*\n  composed: false,\n*/!*\n  detail: \"not composed\"\n}));\n</script>\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nEvents only cross shadow DOM boundaries if their `composed` flag is set to `true`.\n\nBuilt-in events mostly have `composed: true`, as described in the relevant specifications:\n\n- UI Events <https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents>.\n- Touch Events <https://w3c.github.io/touch-events>.\n- Pointer Events <https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents>.\n- ...And so on.\n\nSome built-in events that have `composed: false`:\n\n- `mouseenter`, `mouseleave` (also do not bubble),\n- `load`, `unload`, `abort`, `error`,\n- `select`,\n- `slotchange`.\n\nThese events can be caught only on elements within the same DOM.\n\nIf we dispatch a `CustomEvent`, then we should explicitly set `composed: true`.\n\nPlease note that in case of nested components, one shadow DOM may be nested into another. In that case composed events bubble through all shadow DOM boundaries. So, if an event is intended only for the immediate enclosing component, we can also dispatch it on the shadow host and set `composed: false`. Then it's out of the component shadow DOM, but won't bubble up to higher-level DOM.",

        "content": "\n\nRegular expressions are patterns that provide a powerful way to search and replace in text.\n\nIn JavaScript, they are available via the [RegExp](mdn:js/RegExp) object, as well as being integrated in methods of strings.\n\n## Regular Expressions\n\nA regular expression (also \"regexp\", or just \"reg\") consists of a *pattern* and optional *flags*.\n\nThere are two syntaxes that can be used to create a regular expression object.\n\nThe \"long\" syntax:\n\n```js\nregexp = new RegExp(\"pattern\", \"flags\");\n```\n\nAnd the \"short\" one, using slashes `\"/\"`:\n\n```js\nregexp = /pattern/; // no flags\nregexp = /pattern/gmi; // with flags g,m and i (to be covered soon)\n```\n\nSlashes `pattern:/.../` tell JavaScript that we are creating a regular expression. They play the same role as quotes for strings.\n\nIn both cases `regexp` becomes an instance of the built-in `RegExp` class.\n\nThe main difference between these two syntaxes is that pattern using slashes `/.../` does not allow for expressions to be inserted (like string template literals with `${...}`). They are fully static.\n\nSlashes are used when we know the regular expression at the code writing time -- and that's the most common situation. While `new RegExp`, is more often used when we need to create a regexp \"on the fly\" from a dynamically generated string. For instance:\n\n```js\nlet tag = prompt(\"What tag do you want to find?\", \"h2\");\n\nlet regexp = new RegExp(`<${tag}>`); // same as /<h2>/ if answered \"h2\" in the prompt above\n```\n\n## Flags\n\nRegular expressions may have flags that affect the search.\n\nThere are only 6 of them in JavaScript:\n\n`pattern:i`\n: With this flag the search is case-insensitive: no difference between `A` and `a` (see the example below).\n\n`pattern:g`\n: With this flag the search looks for all matches, without it -- only the first match is returned.\n\n`pattern:m`\n: Multiline mode (covered in the chapter <info:regexp-multiline-mode>).\n\n`pattern:s`\n: Enables \"dotall\" mode, that allows a dot `pattern:.` to match newline character `\\n` (covered in the chapter <info:regexp-character-classes>).\n\n`pattern:u`\n: Enables full unicode support. The flag enables correct processing of surrogate pairs. More about that in the chapter <info:regexp-unicode>.\n\n`pattern:y`\n: \"Sticky\" mode: searching at the exact position in the text  (covered in the chapter <info:regexp-sticky>)\n\n```smart header=\"Colors\"\nFrom here on the color scheme is:\n\n- regexp -- `pattern:red`\n- string (where we search) -- `subject:blue`\n- result -- `match:green`\n```\n\n## Searching: str.match\n\nAs mentioned previously, regular expressions are integrated with string methods.\n\nThe method `str.match(regexp)` finds all matches of `regexp` in the string `str`.\n\nIt has 3 working modes:\n\n1. If the regular expression has flag `pattern:g`, it returns an array of all matches:\n    ```js run\n    let str = \"We will, we will rock you\";\n\n    alert( str.match(/we/gi) ); // We,we (an array of 2 substrings that match)\n    ```\n    Please note that both `match:We` and `match:we` are found, because flag `pattern:i` makes the regular expression case-insensitive.\n\n2. If there's no such flag it returns only the first match in the form of an array, with the full match at index `0` and some additional details in properties:\n    ```js run\n    let str = \"We will, we will rock you\";\n\n    let result = str.match(/we/i); // without flag g\n\n    alert( result[0] );     // We (1st match)\n    alert( result.length ); // 1\n\n    // Details:\n    alert( result.index );  // 0 (position of the match)\n    alert( result.input );  // We will, we will rock you (source string)\n    ```\n    The array may have other indexes, besides `0` if a part of the regular expression is enclosed in parentheses. We'll cover that in the chapter  <info:regexp-groups>.\n\n3. And, finally, if there are no matches, `null` is returned (doesn't matter if there's flag `pattern:g` or not).\n\n    This a very important nuance. If there are no matches, we don't receive an empty array, but instead receive `null`. Forgetting about that may lead to errors, e.g.:\n\n    ```js run\n    let matches = \"JavaScript\".match(/HTML/); // = null\n\n    if (!matches.length) { // Error: Cannot read property 'length' of null\n      alert(\"Error in the line above\");\n    }\n    ```\n\n    If we'd like the result to always be an array, we can write it this way:\n\n    ```js run\n    let matches = \"JavaScript\".match(/HTML/)*!* || []*/!*;\n\n    if (!matches.length) {\n      alert(\"No matches\"); // now it works\n    }\n    ```\n\n## Replacing: str.replace\n\nThe method `str.replace(regexp, replacement)` replaces matches found using `regexp` in string `str` with `replacement` (all matches if there's flag `pattern:g`, otherwise, only the first one).\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\n// no flag g\nalert( \"We will, we will\".replace(/we/i, \"I\") ); // I will, we will\n\n// with flag g\nalert( \"We will, we will\".replace(/we/ig, \"I\") ); // I will, I will\n```\n\nThe second argument is the `replacement` string. We can use special character combinations in it to insert fragments of the match:\n\n| Symbols | Action in the replacement string |\n|--------|--------|\n|`$&`|inserts the whole match|\n|<code>$&#096;</code>|inserts a part of the string before the match|\n|`$'`|inserts a part of the string after the match|\n|`$n`|if `n` is a 1-2 digit number, then it inserts the contents of n-th parentheses, more about it in the chapter <info:regexp-groups>|\n|`$<name>`|inserts the contents of the parentheses with the given `name`, more about it in the chapter <info:regexp-groups>|\n|`$$`|inserts character `$` |\n\nAn example with `pattern:$&`:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"I love HTML\".replace(/HTML/, \"$& and JavaScript\") ); // I love HTML and JavaScript\n```\n\n## Testing: regexp.test\n\nThe method `regexp.test(str)` looks for at least one match, if found, returns `true`, otherwise `false`.\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"I love JavaScript\";\nlet regexp = /LOVE/i;\n\nalert( regexp.test(str) ); // true\n```\n\nLater in this chapter we'll study more regular expressions, walk through more examples, and also meet other methods.\n\nFull information about the methods is given in the article <info:regexp-methods>.\n\n## Summary\n\n- A regular expression consists of a pattern and optional flags: `pattern:g`, `pattern:i`, `pattern:m`, `pattern:u`, `pattern:s`, `pattern:y`.\n- Without flags and special symbols  (that we'll study later), the search by a regexp is the same as a substring search.\n- The method `str.match(regexp)` looks for matches: all of them if there's `pattern:g` flag, otherwise, only the first one.\n- The method `str.replace(regexp, replacement)` replaces matches found using `regexp` with `replacement`: all of them if there's `pattern:g` flag, otherwise only the first one.\n- The method `regexp.test(str)` returns `true` if there's at least one match, otherwise, it returns `false`.",

        "content": "\n\nConsider a practical task -- we have a phone number like `\"+7(903)-123-45-67\"`, and we need to turn it into pure numbers: `79031234567`.\n\nTo do so, we can find and remove anything that's not a number. Character classes can help with that.\n\nA *character class* is a special notation that matches any symbol from a certain set.\n\nFor the start, let's explore the \"digit\" class. It's written as `pattern:\\d` and corresponds to \"any single digit\".\n\nFor instance, the let's find the first digit in the phone number:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"+7(903)-123-45-67\";\n\nlet regexp = /\\d/;\n\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // 7\n```\n\nWithout the flag `pattern:g`, the regular expression only looks for the first match, that is the first digit `pattern:\\d`.\n\nLet's add the `pattern:g` flag to find all digits:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"+7(903)-123-45-67\";\n\nlet regexp = /\\d/g;\n\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // array of matches: 7,9,0,3,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n\n// let's make the digits-only phone number of them:\nalert( str.match(regexp).join('') ); // 79031234567\n```\n\nThat was a character class for digits. There are other character classes as well.\n\nMost used are:\n\n`pattern:\\d` (\"d\" is from \"digit\")\n: A digit: a character from `0` to `9`.\n\n`pattern:\\s` (\"s\" is from \"space\")\n: A space symbol: includes spaces, tabs `\\t`, newlines `\\n` and few other rare characters, such as `\\v`, `\\f` and `\\r`.\n\n`pattern:\\w` (\"w\" is from \"word\")\n: A \"wordly\" character: either a letter of Latin alphabet or a digit or an underscore `_`. Non-Latin letters (like cyrillic or hindi) do not belong to `pattern:\\w`.\n\nFor instance, `pattern:\\d\\s\\w` means a \"digit\" followed by a \"space character\" followed by a \"wordly character\", such as `match:1 a`.\n\n**A regexp may contain both regular symbols and character classes.**\n\nFor instance, `pattern:CSS\\d` matches a string `match:CSS` with a digit after it:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"Is there CSS4?\";\nlet regexp = /CSS\\d/\n\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // CSS4\n```\n\nAlso we can use many character classes:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"I love HTML5!\".match(/\\s\\w\\w\\w\\w\\d/) ); // ' HTML5'\n```\n\nThe match (each regexp character class has the corresponding result character):\n\n![](love-html5-classes.svg)\n\n## Inverse classes\n\nFor every character class there exists an \"inverse class\", denoted with the same letter, but uppercased.\n\nThe \"inverse\" means that it matches all other characters, for instance:\n\n`pattern:\\D`\n: Non-digit: any character except `pattern:\\d`, for instance a letter.\n\n`pattern:\\S`\n: Non-space: any character except `pattern:\\s`, for instance a letter.\n\n`pattern:\\W`\n: Non-wordly character: anything but `pattern:\\w`, e.g a non-latin letter or a space.\n\nIn the beginning of the chapter we saw how to make a number-only phone number from a string like `subject:+7(903)-123-45-67`: find all digits and join them.\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"+7(903)-123-45-67\";\n\nalert( str.match(/\\d/g).join('') ); // 79031234567\n```\n\nAn alternative, shorter way is to find non-digits `pattern:\\D` and remove them from the string:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"+7(903)-123-45-67\";\n\nalert( str.replace(/\\D/g, \"\") ); // 79031234567\n```\n\n## A dot is \"any character\"\n\nA dot `pattern:.` is a special character class that matches \"any character except a newline\".\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"Z\".match(/./) ); // Z\n```\n\nOr in the middle of a regexp:\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /CS.4/;\n\nalert( \"CSS4\".match(regexp) ); // CSS4\nalert( \"CS-4\".match(regexp) ); // CS-4\nalert( \"CS 4\".match(regexp) ); // CS 4 (space is also a character)\n```\n\nPlease note that a dot means \"any character\", but not the \"absense of a character\". There must be a character to match it:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"CS4\".match(/CS.4/) ); // null, no match because there's no character for the dot\n```\n\n### Dot as literally any character with \"s\" flag\n\nBy default, a dot doesn't match the newline character `\\n`.\n\nFor instance, the regexp `pattern:A.B` matches `match:A`, and then `match:B` with any character between them, except a newline `\\n`:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"A\\nB\".match(/A.B/) ); // null (no match)\n```\n\nThere are many situations when we'd like a dot to mean literally \"any character\", newline included.\n\nThat's what flag `pattern:s` does. If a regexp has it, then a dot `pattern:.` matches literally any character:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"A\\nB\".match(/A.B/s) ); // A\\nB (match!)\n```\n\n````warn header=\"Not supported in Firefox, IE, Edge\"\nCheck <https://caniuse.com/#search=dotall> for the most recent state of support. At the time of writing it doesn't include Firefox, IE, Edge.\n\nLuckily, there's an alternative, that works everywhere. We can use a regexp like `pattern:[\\s\\S]` to match \"any character\".\n\n```js run\nalert( \"A\\nB\".match(/A[\\s\\S]B/) ); // A\\nB (match!)\n```\n\nThe pattern `pattern:[\\s\\S]` literally says: \"a space character OR not a space character\". In other words, \"anything\". We could use another pair of complementary classes, such as `pattern:[\\d\\D]`, that doesn't matter. Or even the `pattern:[^]` -- as it means match any character except nothing.\n\nAlso we can use this trick if we want both kind of \"dots\" in the same pattern: the actual dot `pattern:.` behaving the regular way (\"not including a newline\"), and also a way to match \"any character\" with `pattern:[\\s\\S]` or alike.\n````\n\n````warn header=\"Pay attention to spaces\"\nUsually we pay little attention to spaces. For us strings `subject:1-5` and `subject:1 - 5` are nearly identical.\n\nBut if a regexp doesn't take spaces into account, it may fail to work.\n\nLet's try to find digits separated by a hyphen:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"1 - 5\".match(/\\d-\\d/) ); // null, no match!\n```\n\nLet's fix it adding spaces into the regexp `pattern:\\d - \\d`:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"1 - 5\".match(/\\d - \\d/) ); // 1 - 5, now it works\n// or we can use \\s class:\nalert( \"1 - 5\".match(/\\d\\s-\\s\\d/) ); // 1 - 5, also works\n```\n\n**A space is a character. Equal in importance with any other character.**\n\nWe can't add or remove spaces from a regular expression and expect to work the same.\n\nIn other words, in a regular expression all characters matter, spaces too.\n````\n\n## Summary\n\nThere exist following character classes:\n\n- `pattern:\\d` -- digits.\n- `pattern:\\D` -- non-digits.\n- `pattern:\\s` -- space symbols, tabs, newlines.\n- `pattern:\\S` -- all but `pattern:\\s`.\n- `pattern:\\w` -- Latin letters, digits, underscore `'_'`.\n- `pattern:\\W` -- all but `pattern:\\w`.\n- `pattern:.` -- any character if with the regexp `'s'` flag, otherwise any except a newline `\\n`.\n\n...But that's not all!\n\nUnicode encoding, used by JavaScript for strings, provides many properties for characters, like: which language the letter belongs to (if it's a letter) it is it a punctuation sign, etc.\n\nWe can search by these properties as well. That requires flag `pattern:u`, covered in the next article.",

        "content": "\n\nJavaScript uses [Unicode encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) for strings. Most characters are encoded with 2 bytes, but that allows to represent at most 65536 characters.\n\nThat range is not big enough to encode all possible characters, that's why some rare characters are encoded with 4 bytes, for instance like `𝒳` (mathematical X) or `😄` (a smile), some hieroglyphs and so on.\n\nHere are the unicode values of some characters:\n\n| Character  | Unicode | Bytes count in unicode  |\n|------------|---------|--------|\n| a | `0x0061` |  2 |\n| ≈ | `0x2248` |  2 |\n|𝒳| `0x1d4b3` | 4 |\n|𝒴| `0x1d4b4` | 4 |\n|😄| `0x1f604` | 4 |\n\nSo characters like `a` and `≈` occupy 2 bytes, while codes for `𝒳`, `𝒴` and `😄` are longer, they have 4 bytes.\n\nLong time ago, when JavaScript language was created, Unicode encoding was simpler: there were no 4-byte characters. So, some language features still handle them incorrectly.\n\nFor instance, `length` thinks that here are two characters:\n\n```js run\nalert('😄'.length); // 2\nalert('𝒳'.length); // 2\n```\n\n...But we can see that there's only one, right? The point is that `length` treats 4 bytes as two 2-byte characters. That's incorrect, because they must be considered only together (so-called \"surrogate pair\", you can read about them in the article <info:string>).\n\nBy default, regular expressions also treat 4-byte \"long characters\" as a pair of 2-byte ones. And, as it happens with strings, that may lead to odd results. We'll see that a bit later, in the article <info:regexp-character-sets-and-ranges>.\n\nUnlike strings, regular expressions have flag `pattern:u` that fixes such problems. With such flag, a regexp handles 4-byte characters correctly. And also Unicode property search becomes available, we'll get to it next.\n\n## Unicode properties \\p{...}\n\n```warn header=\"Not supported in Firefox and Edge\"\nDespite being a part of the standard since 2018, unicode properties are not supported in Firefox ([bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1361876)) and Edge ([bug](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/issues/2969)).\n\nThere's [XRegExp](http://xregexp.com) library that provides \"extended\" regular expressions with cross-browser support for unicode properties.\n```\n\nEvery character in Unicode has a lot of properties. They describe what \"category\" the character belongs to, contain miscellaneous information about it.\n\nFor instance, if a character has `Letter` property, it means that the character belongs to an alphabet (of any language). And `Number` property means that it's a digit: maybe Arabic or Chinese, and so on.\n\nWe can search for characters with a property, written as `pattern:\\p{…}`. To use `pattern:\\p{…}`, a regular expression must have flag `pattern:u`.\n\nFor instance, `\\p{Letter}` denotes a letter in any of language. We can also use `\\p{L}`, as `L` is an alias of `Letter`. There are shorter aliases for almost every property.\n\nIn the example below three kinds of letters will be found: English, Georgean and Korean.\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"A ბ ㄱ\";\n\nalert( str.match(/\\p{L}/gu) ); // A,ბ,ㄱ\nalert( str.match(/\\p{L}/g) ); // null (no matches, as there's no flag \"u\")\n```\n\nHere's the main character categories and their subcategories:\n\n- Letter `L`:\n  - lowercase `Ll`\n  - modifier `Lm`,\n  - titlecase `Lt`,\n  - uppercase `Lu`,\n  - other `Lo`.\n- Number `N`:\n  - decimal digit `Nd`,\n  - letter number `Nl`,\n  - other `No`.\n- Punctuation `P`:\n  - connector `Pc`,\n  - dash `Pd`,\n  - initial quote `Pi`,\n  - final quote `Pf`,\n  - open `Ps`,\n  - close `Pe`,\n  - other `Po`.\n- Mark `M` (accents etc):\n  - spacing combining `Mc`,\n  - enclosing `Me`,\n  - non-spacing `Mn`.\n- Symbol `S`:\n  - currency `Sc`,\n  - modifier `Sk`,\n  - math `Sm`,\n  - other `So`.\n- Separator `Z`:\n  - line `Zl`,\n  - paragraph `Zp`,\n  - space `Zs`.\n- Other `C`:\n  - control `Cc`,\n  - format `Cf`,\n  - not assigned `Cn`,\n  - private use `Co`,\n  - surrogate `Cs`.\n\n\nSo, e.g. if we need letters in lower case, we can write `pattern:\\p{Ll}`, punctuation signs: `pattern:\\p{P}` and so on.\n\nThere are also other derived categories, like:\n- `Alphabetic` (`Alpha`), includes Letters `L`, plus letter numbers `Nl` (e.g. Ⅻ - a character for the roman number 12), plus some other symbols `Other_Alphabetic` (`OAlpha`).\n- `Hex_Digit` includes hexadecimal digits: `0-9`, `a-f`.\n- ...And so on.\n\nUnicode supports many different properties, their full list would require a lot of space, so here are the references:\n\n- List all properties by a character: <https://unicode.org/cldr/utility/character.jsp>.\n- List all characters by a property: <https://unicode.org/cldr/utility/list-unicodeset.jsp>.\n- Short aliases for properties: <https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/PropertyValueAliases.txt>.\n- A full base of Unicode characters in text format, with all properties, is here: <https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/>.\n\n### Example: hexadecimal numbers\n\nFor instance, let's look for hexadecimal numbers, written as `xFF`, where `F` is a hex digit (0..1 or A..F).\n\nA hex digit can be denoted as `pattern:\\p{Hex_Digit}`:\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /x\\p{Hex_Digit}\\p{Hex_Digit}/u;\n\nalert(\"number: xAF\".match(regexp)); // xAF\n```\n\n### Example: Chinese hieroglyphs\n\nLet's look for Chinese hieroglyphs.\n\nThere's a unicode property `Script` (a writing system), that may have a value: `Cyrillic`, `Greek`, `Arabic`, `Han` (Chinese) and so on, [here's the full list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_(Unicode)).\n\nTo look for characters in a given writing system we should use `pattern:Script=<value>`, e.g. for Cyrillic letters: `pattern:\\p{sc=Cyrillic}`, for Chinese hieroglyphs: `pattern:\\p{sc=Han}`, and so on:\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /\\p{sc=Han}/gu; // returns Chinese hieroglyphs\n\nlet str = `Hello Привет 你好 123_456`;\n\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // 你,好\n```\n\n### Example: currency\n\nCharacters that denote a currency, such as `$`, `€`, `¥`, have unicode property  `pattern:\\p{Currency_Symbol}`, the short alias: `pattern:\\p{Sc}`.\n\nLet's use it to look for prices in the format \"currency, followed by a digit\":\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /\\p{Sc}\\d/gu;\n\nlet  str = `Prices: $2, €1, ¥9`;\n\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // $2,€1,¥9\n```\n\nLater, in the article <info:regexp-quantifiers> we'll see how to look for numbers that contain many digits.\n\n## Summary\n\nFlag `pattern:u` enables the support of Unicode in regular expressions.\n\nThat means two things:\n\n1. Characters of 4 bytes are handled correctly: as a single character, not two 2-byte characters.\n2. Unicode properties can be used in the search: `\\p{…}`.\n\nWith Unicode properties we can look for words in given languages, special characters (quotes, currencies) and so on.",

Regular expressions should be used for more complex tests.\n\n## Testing for a full match\n\nBoth anchors together `pattern:^...$` are often used to test whether or not a string fully matches the pattern. For instance, to check if the user input is in the right format.\n\nLet's check whether or not a string is a time in `12:34` format. That is: two digits, then a colon, and then another two digits.\n\nIn regular expressions language that's `pattern:\\d\\d:\\d\\d`:\n\n```js run\nlet goodInput = \"12:34\";\nlet badInput = \"12:345\";\n\nlet regexp = /^\\d\\d:\\d\\d$/;\nalert( regexp.test(goodInput) ); // true\nalert( regexp.test(badInput) ); // false\n```\n\nHere the match for `pattern:\\d\\d:\\d\\d` must start exactly after the beginning of the text `pattern:^`, and the end `pattern:$` must immediately follow.\n\nThe whole string must be exactly in this format. If there's any deviation or an extra character, the result is `false`.\n\nAnchors behave differently if flag `pattern:m` is present. We'll see that in the next article.\n\n```smart header=\"Anchors have \\\"zero width\\\"\"\nAnchors `pattern:^` and `pattern:$` are tests. They have zero width.\n\nIn other words, they do not match a character, but rather force the regexp engine to check the condition (text start/end).\n```",

The pattern `pattern:/^\\d/gm` takes a digit from the beginning of each line:\n\n```js run\nlet str = `1st place: Winnie\n2nd place: Piglet\n3rd place: Eeyore`;\n\n*!*\nalert( str.match(/^\\d/gm) ); // 1, 2, 3\n*/!*\n```\n\nWithout the flag `pattern:m` only the first digit is matched:\n\n```js run\nlet str = `1st place: Winnie\n2nd place: Piglet\n3rd place: Eeyore`;\n\n*!*\nalert( str.match(/^\\d/g) ); // 1\n*/!*\n```\n\nThat's because by default a caret `pattern:^` only matches at the beginning of the text, and in the multiline mode -- at the start of any line.\n\n```smart\n\"Start of a line\" formally means \"immediately after a line break\": the test  `pattern:^` in multiline mode matches at all positions preceeded by a newline character `\\n`.\n\nAnd at the text start.\n```\n\n## Searching at line end $\n\nThe dollar sign `pattern:$` behaves similarly.\n\nThe regular expression `pattern:\\d$` finds the last digit in every line\n\n```js run\nlet str = `Winnie: 1\nPiglet: 2\nEeyore: 3`;\n\nalert( str.match(/\\d$/gm) ); // 1,2,3\n```\n\nWithout the flag `pattern:m`, the dollar `pattern:$` would only match the end of the whole text, so only the very last digit would be found.\n\n```smart\n\"End of a line\" formally means \"immediately before a line break\": the test  `pattern:$` in multiline mode matches at all positions succeeded by a newline character `\\n`.\n\nAnd at the text end.\n```\n\n## Searching for \\n instead of ^ $\n\nTo find a newline, we can use not only anchors `pattern:^` and `pattern:$`, but also the newline character `\\n`.\n\nWhat's the difference? Let's see an example.\n\nHere we search for `pattern:\\d\\n` instead of `pattern:\\d$`:\n\n```js run\nlet str = `Winnie: 1\nPiglet: 2\nEeyore: 3`;\n\nalert( str.match(/\\d\\n/gm) ); // 1\\n,2\\n\n```\n\nAs we can see, there are 2 matches instead of 3.\n\nThat's because there's no newline after `subject:3` (there's text end though, so it matches `pattern:$`).\n\nAnother difference: now every match includes a newline character `match:\\n`. Unlike the anchors `pattern:^` `pattern:$`, that only test the condition (start/end of a line), `\\n` is a character, so it becomes a part of the result.\n\nSo, a `\\n` in the pattern is used when we need newline characters in the result, while anchors are used to find something at the beginning/end of a line.",

At the beginning of the string matches the first test `pattern:\\b`.\n2. Then matches the word `pattern:Hello`.\n3. Then the test `pattern:\\b` matches again, as we're between `subject:o` and a space.\n\nThe pattern `pattern:\\bHello\\b` would also match. But not `pattern:\\bHell\\b` (because there's no word boundary after `l`) and not `Java!\\b` (because the exclamation sign is not a wordly character `pattern:\\w`, so there's no word boundary after it).\n\n```js run\nalert( \"Hello, Java!\".match(/\\bHello\\b/) ); // Hello\nalert( \"Hello, Java!\".match(/\\bJava\\b/) );  // Java\nalert( \"Hello, Java!\".match(/\\bHell\\b/) );  // null (no match)\nalert( \"Hello, Java!\".match(/\\bJava!\\b/) ); // null (no match)\n```\n\nWe can use `pattern:\\b` not only with words, but with digits as well.\n\nFor example, the pattern `pattern:\\b\\d\\d\\b` looks for standalone 2-digit numbers. In other words, it looks for 2-digit numbers that are surrounded by characters different from `pattern:\\w`, such as spaces or punctuation (or text start/end).\n\n```js run\nalert( \"1 23 456 78\".match(/\\b\\d\\d\\b/g) ); // 23,78\nalert( \"12,34,56\".match(/\\b\\d\\d\\b/g) ); // 12,34,56\n```\n\n```warn header=\"Word boundary `pattern:\\b` doesn't work for non-latin alphabets\"\nThe word boundary test `pattern:\\b` checks that there should be `pattern:\\w` on the one side from the position and \"not `pattern:\\w`\" - on the other side.\n\nBut `pattern:\\w` means a latin letter `a-z` (or a digit or an underscore), so the test doesn't work for other characters, e.g. cyrillic letters or hieroglyphs.\n```",

        "content": "\n\nAs we've seen, a backslash `pattern:\\` is used to denote character classes, e.g. `pattern:\\d`. So it's a special character in regexps (just like in regular strings).\n\nThere are other special characters as well, that have special meaning in a regexp. They are used to do more powerful searches. Here's a full list of them: `pattern:[ \\ ^ $ . | ? * + ( )`.\n\nDon't try to remember the list -- soon we'll deal with each of them separately and you'll know them by heart automatically.\n\n## Escaping\n\nLet's say we want to find literally a dot. Not \"any character\", but just a dot.\n\nTo use a special character as a regular one, prepend it with a backslash: `pattern:\\.`.\n\nThat's also called \"escaping a character\".\n\nFor example:\n```js run\nalert( \"Chapter 5.1\".match(/\\d\\.\\d/) ); // 5.1 (match!)\nalert( \"Chapter 511\".match(/\\d\\.\\d/) ); // null (looking for a real dot \\.)\n```\n\nParentheses are also special characters, so if we want them, we should use `pattern:\\(`. The example below looks for a string `\"g()\"`:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"function g()\".match(/g\\(\\)/) ); // \"g()\"\n```\n\nIf we're looking for a backslash `\\`, it's a special character in both regular strings and regexps, so we should double it.\n\n```js run\nalert( \"1\\\\2\".match(/\\\\/) ); // '\\'\n```\n\n## A slash\n\nA slash symbol `'/'` is not a special character, but in JavaScript it is used to open and close the regexp: `pattern:/...pattern.../`, so we should escape it too.\n\nHere's what a search for a slash `'/'` looks like:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"/\".match(/\\//) ); // '/'\n```\n\nOn the other hand, if we're not using `pattern:/.../`, but create a regexp using `new RegExp`, then we don't need to escape it:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"/\".match(new RegExp(\"/\")) ); // finds /\n```\n\n## new RegExp\n\nIf we are creating a regular expression with `new RegExp`, then we don't have to escape `/`, but need to do some other escaping.\n\nFor instance, consider this:\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = new RegExp(\"\\d\\.\\d\");\n\nalert( \"Chapter 5.1\".match(regexp) ); // null\n```\n\nThe similar search in one of previous examples worked with `pattern:/\\d\\.\\d/`, but `new RegExp(\"\\d\\.\\d\")` doesn't work, why?\n\nThe reason is that backslashes are \"consumed\" by a string. As we may recall, regular strings have their own special characters, such as `\\n`, and a backslash is used for escaping.\n\nHere's how \"\\d\\.\\d\" is preceived:\n\n```js run\nalert(\"\\d\\.\\d\"); // d.d\n```\n\nString quotes \"consume\" backslashes and interpret them on their own, for instance:\n\n- `\\n` -- becomes a newline character,\n- `\\u1234` -- becomes the Unicode character with such code,\n- ...And when there's no special meaning: like `pattern:\\d` or `\\z`, then the backslash is simply removed.\n\nSo `new RegExp` gets a string without backslashes. That's why the search doesn't work!\n\nTo fix it, we need to double backslashes, because string quotes turn `\\\\` into `\\`:\n\n```js run\n*!*\nlet regStr = \"\\\\d\\\\.\\\\d\";\n*/!*\nalert(regStr); // \\d\\.\\d (correct now)\n\nlet regexp = new RegExp(regStr);\n\nalert( \"Chapter 5.1\".match(regexp) ); // 5.1\n```\n\n## Summary\n\n- To search for special characters `pattern:[ \\ ^ $ . | ? * + ( )` literally, we need to prepend them with a backslash `\\` (\"escape them\").\n- We also need to escape `/` if we're inside `pattern:/.../` (but not inside `new RegExp`).\n- When passing a string `new RegExp`, we need to double backslashes `\\\\`, cause string quotes consume one of them.",

Sets can be used in a regexp along with regular characters:\n\n```js run\n// find [t or m], and then \"op\"\nalert( \"Mop top\".match(/[tm]op/gi) ); // \"Mop\", \"top\"\n```\n\nPlease note that although there are multiple characters in the set, they correspond to exactly one character in the match.\n\nSo the example below gives no matches:\n\n```js run\n// find \"V\", then [o or i], then \"la\"\nalert( \"Voila\".match(/V[oi]la/) ); // null, no matches\n```\n\nThe pattern searches for:\n\n- `pattern:V`,\n- then *one* of the letters `pattern:[oi]`,\n- then `pattern:la`.\n\nSo there would be a match for `match:Vola` or `match:Vila`.\n\n## Ranges\n\nSquare brackets may also contain *character ranges*.\n\nFor instance, `pattern:[a-z]` is a character in range from `a` to `z`, and `pattern:[0-5]` is a digit from `0` to `5`.\n\nIn the example below we're searching for `\"x\"` followed by two digits or letters from `A` to `F`:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"Exception 0xAF\".match(/x[0-9A-F][0-9A-F]/g) ); // xAF\n```\n\nHere `pattern:[0-9A-F]` has two ranges: it searches for a character that is either a digit from `0` to `9` or a letter from `A` to `F`.\n\nIf we'd like to look for lowercase letters as well, we can add the range `a-f`: `pattern:[0-9A-Fa-f]`. Or add the flag `pattern:i`.\n\nWe can also use character classes inside `[…]`.\n\nFor instance, if we'd like to look for a wordly character `pattern:\\w` or a hyphen `pattern:-`, then the set is `pattern:[\\w-]`.\n\nCombining multiple classes is also possible, e.g. `pattern:[\\s\\d]` means \"a space character or a digit\".\n\n```smart header=\"Character classes are shorthands for certain character sets\"\nFor instance:\n\n- **\\d** -- is the same as `pattern:[0-9]`,\n- **\\w** -- is the same as `pattern:[a-zA-Z0-9_]`,\n- **\\s** -- is the same as `pattern:[\\t\\n\\v\\f\\r ]`, plus few other rare unicode space characters.\n```\n\n### Example: multi-language \\w\n\nAs the character class `pattern:\\w` is a shorthand for `pattern:[a-zA-Z0-9_]`, it can't find Chinese hieroglyphs, Cyrillic letters, etc.\n\nWe can write a more universal pattern, that looks for wordly characters in any language. That's easy with unicode properties: `pattern:[\\p{Alpha}\\p{M}\\p{Nd}\\p{Pc}\\p{Join_C}]`.\n\nLet's decipher it. Similar to `pattern:\\w`, we're making a set of our own that includes characters with following unicode properties:\n\n- `Alphabetic` (`Alpha`) - for letters,\n- `Mark` (`M`) - for accents,\n- `Decimal_Number` (`Nd`) - for digits,\n- `Connector_Punctuation` (`Pc`) - for the underscore `'_'` and similar characters,\n- `Join_Control` (`Join_C`) - two special codes `200c` and `200d`, used in ligatures, e.g. in Arabic.\n\nAn example of use:\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /[\\p{Alpha}\\p{M}\\p{Nd}\\p{Pc}\\p{Join_C}]/gu;\n\nlet str = `Hi 你好 12`;\n\n// finds all letters and digits:\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // H,i,你,好,1,2\n```\n\nOf course, we can edit this pattern: add unicode properties or remove them. Unicode properties are covered in more details in the article <info:regexp-unicode>.\n\n```warn header=\"Unicode properties aren't supported in Edge and Firefox\"\nUnicode properties `pattern:p{…}` are not yet implemented in Edge and Firefox. If we really need them, we can use library [XRegExp](http://xregexp.com/).\n\nOr just use ranges of characters in a language that interests us, e.g.  `pattern:[а-я]` for Cyrillic letters.\n```\n\n## Excluding ranges\n\nBesides normal ranges, there are \"excluding\" ranges that look like `pattern:[^…]`.\n\nThey are denoted by a caret character `^` at the start and match any character *except the given ones*.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- `pattern:[^aeyo]` -- any character except  `'a'`, `'e'`, `'y'` or `'o'`.\n- `pattern:[^0-9]` -- any character except a digit, the same as `pattern:\\D`.\n- `pattern:[^\\s]` -- any non-space character, same as `\\S`.\n\nThe example below looks for any characters except letters, digits and spaces:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"alice15@gmail.com\".match(/[^\\d\\sA-Z]/gi) ); // @ and .\n```\n\n## Escaping in […]\n\nUsually when we want to find exactly a special character, we need to escape it like `pattern:\\.`. And if we need a backslash, then we use `pattern:\\\\`, and so on.\n\nIn square brackets we can use the vast majority of special characters without escaping:\n\n- Symbols `pattern:. + ( )` never need escaping.\n- A hyphen `pattern:-` is not escaped in the beginning or the end (where it does not define a range).\n- A caret `pattern:^` is only escaped in the beginning (where it means exclusion).\n- The closing square bracket `pattern:]` is always escaped (if we need to look for that symbol).\n\nIn other words, all special characters are allowed without escaping, except when they mean something for square brackets.\n\nA dot `.` inside square brackets means just a dot. The pattern `pattern:[.,]` would look for one of characters: either a dot or a comma.\n\nIn the example below the regexp `pattern:[-().^+]` looks for one of the characters `-().^+`:\n\n```js run\n// No need to escape\nlet regexp = /[-().^+]/g;\n\nalert( \"1 + 2 - 3\".match(regexp) ); // Matches +, -\n```\n\n...But if you decide to escape them \"just in case\", then there would be no harm:\n\n```js run\n// Escaped everything\nlet regexp = /[\\-\\(\\)\\.\\^\\+]/g;\n\nalert( \"1 + 2 - 3\".match(regexp) ); // also works: +, -\n```\n\n## Ranges and flag \"u\"\n\nIf there are surrogate pairs in the set, flag `pattern:u` is required for them to work correctly.\n\nFor instance, let's look for `pattern:[𝒳𝒴]` in the string `subject:𝒳`:\n\n```js run\nalert( '𝒳'.match(/[𝒳𝒴]/) ); // shows a strange character, like [?]\n// (the search was performed incorrectly, half-character returned)\n```\n\nThe result is incorrect, because by default regular expressions \"don't know\" about surrogate pairs.\n\nThe regular expression engine thinks that `[𝒳𝒴]` -- are not two, but four characters:\n1. left half of `𝒳` `(1)`,\n2. right half of `𝒳` `(2)`,\n3. left half of `𝒴` `(3)`,\n4. right half of `𝒴` `(4)`.\n\nWe can see their codes like this:\n\n```js run\nfor(let i=0; i<'𝒳𝒴'.length; i++) {\n  alert('𝒳𝒴'.charCodeAt(i)); // 55349, 56499, 55349, 56500\n};\n```\n\nSo, the example above finds and shows the left half of `𝒳`.\n\nIf we add flag `pattern:u`, then the behavior will be correct:\n\n```js run\nalert( '𝒳'.match(/[𝒳𝒴]/u) ); // 𝒳\n```\n\nThe similar situation occurs when looking for a range, such as `[𝒳-𝒴]`.\n\nIf we forget to add flag `pattern:u`, there will be an error:\n\n```js run\n'𝒳'.match(/[𝒳-𝒴]/); // Error: Invalid regular expression\n```\n\nThe reason is that without flag `pattern:u` surrogate pairs are perceived as two characters, so `[𝒳-𝒴]` is interpreted as `[<55349><56499>-<55349><56500>]` (every surrogate pair is replaced with its codes). Now it's easy to see that the range `56499-55349` is invalid: its starting code `56499` is greater than the end `55349`. That's the formal reason for the error.\n\nWith the flag `pattern:u` the pattern works correctly:\n\n```js run\n// look for characters from 𝒳 to 𝒵\nalert( '𝒴'.match(/[𝒳-𝒵]/u) ); // 𝒴\n```",

To mark how many we need, we can append a *quantifier*.\n\n## Quantity {n}\n\nThe simplest quantifier is a number in curly braces: `pattern:{n}`.\n\nA quantifier is appended to a character (or a character class, or a `[...]` set etc) and specifies how many we need.\n\nIt has a few advanced forms, let's see examples:\n\nThe exact count: `pattern:{5}`\n: `pattern:\\d{5}` denotes exactly 5 digits, the same as `pattern:\\d\\d\\d\\d\\d`.\n\n    The example below looks for a 5-digit number:\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( \"I'm 12345 years old\".match(/\\d{5}/) ); //  \"12345\"\n    ```\n\n    We can add `\\b` to exclude longer numbers: `pattern:\\b\\d{5}\\b`.\n\nThe range: `pattern:{3,5}`, match 3-5 times\n: To find numbers from 3 to 5 digits we can put the limits into curly braces: `pattern:\\d{3,5}`\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( \"I'm not 12, but 1234 years old\".match(/\\d{3,5}/) ); // \"1234\"\n    ```\n\n    We can omit the upper limit.\n\n    Then a regexp `pattern:\\d{3,}` looks for sequences of digits of length `3` or more:\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( \"I'm not 12, but 345678 years old\".match(/\\d{3,}/) ); // \"345678\"\n    ```\n\nLet's return to the string `+7(903)-123-45-67`.\n\nA number is a sequence of one or more digits in a row. So the regexp is `pattern:\\d{1,}`:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"+7(903)-123-45-67\";\n\nlet numbers = str.match(/\\d{1,}/g);\n\nalert(numbers); // 7,903,123,45,67\n```\n\n## Shorthands\n\nThere are shorthands for most used quantifiers:\n\n`pattern:+`\n: Means \"one or more\", the same as `pattern:{1,}`.\n\n    For instance, `pattern:\\d+` looks for numbers:\n\n    ```js run\n    let str = \"+7(903)-123-45-67\";\n\n    alert( str.match(/\\d+/g) ); // 7,903,123,45,67\n    ```\n\n`pattern:?`\n: Means \"zero or one\", the same as `pattern:{0,1}`. In other words, it makes the symbol optional.\n\n    For instance, the pattern `pattern:ou?r` looks for `match:o` followed by zero or one `match:u`, and then `match:r`.\n\n    So, `pattern:colou?r` finds both `match:color` and `match:colour`:\n\n    ```js run\n    let str = \"Should I write color or colour?\";\n\n    alert( str.match(/colou?r/g) ); // color, colour\n    ```\n\n`pattern:*`\n: Means \"zero or more\", the same as `pattern:{0,}`. That is, the character may repeat any times or be absent.\n\n    For example, `pattern:\\d0*` looks for a digit followed by any number of zeroes (may be many or none):\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( \"100 10 1\".match(/\\d0*/g) ); // 100, 10, 1\n    ```\n\n    Compare it with `pattern:+` (one or more):\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( \"100 10 1\".match(/\\d0+/g) ); // 100, 10\n    // 1 not matched, as 0+ requires at least one zero\n    ```\n\n## More examples\n\nQuantifiers are used very often. They serve as the main \"building block\" of complex regular expressions, so let's see more examples.\n\n**Regexp for decimal fractions (a number with a floating point): `pattern:\\d+\\.\\d+`**\n\nIn action:\n```js run\nalert( \"0 1 12.345 7890\".match(/\\d+\\.\\d+/g) ); // 12.345\n```\n\n**Regexp for an \"opening HTML-tag without attributes\", such as `<span>` or `<p>`.**\n\n1. The simplest one: `pattern:/<[a-z]+>/i`\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( \"<body> ... </body>\".match(/<[a-z]+>/gi) ); // <body>\n    ```\n\n    The regexp looks for character `pattern:'<'` followed by one or more Latin letters, and then  `pattern:'>'`.\n\n2. Improved: `pattern:/<[a-z][a-z0-9]*>/i`\n\n    According to the standard, HTML tag name may have a digit at any position except the first one, like `<h1>`.\n\n    ```js run\n    alert( \"<h1>Hi!</h1>\".match(/<[a-z][a-z0-9]*>/gi) ); // <h1>\n    ```\n\n**Regexp \"opening or closing HTML-tag without attributes\": `pattern:/<\\/?[a-z][a-z0-9]*>/i`**\n\nWe added an optional slash `pattern:/?` near the beginning of the pattern. Had to escape it with a backslash, otherwise JavaScript would think it is the pattern end.\n\n```js run\nalert( \"<h1>Hi!</h1>\".match(/<\\/?[a-z][a-z0-9]*>/gi) ); // <h1>, </h1>\n```\n\n```smart header=\"To make a regexp more precise, we often need make it more complex\"\nWe can see one common rule in these examples: the more precise is the regular expression -- the longer and more complex it is.\n\nFor instance, for HTML tags we could use a simpler regexp: `pattern:<\\w+>`. But as HTML has stricter restrictions for a tag name, `pattern:<[a-z][a-z0-9]*>` is more reliable.\n\nCan we use `pattern:<\\w+>` or we need `pattern:<[a-z][a-z0-9]*>`?\n\nIn real life both variants are acceptable. Depends on how tolerant we can be to \"extra\" matches and whether it's difficult or not to remove them from the result by other means.\n```",

        "content": "\n\nQuantifiers are very simple from the first sight, but in fact they can be tricky.\n\nWe should understand how the search works very well if we plan to look for something more complex than `pattern:/\\d+/`.\n\nLet's take the following task as an example.\n\nWe have a text and need to replace all quotes `\"...\"` with guillemet marks: `«...»`. They are preferred for typography in many countries.\n\nFor instance: `\"Hello, world\"` should become `«Hello, world»`. There exist other quotes, such as `„Witam, świat!”` (Polish) or `「你好，世界」` (Chinese), but for our task let's choose `«...»`.\n\nThe first thing to do is to locate quoted strings, and then we can replace them.\n\nA regular expression like `pattern:/\".+\"/g` (a quote, then something, then the other quote) may seem like a good fit, but it isn't!\n\nLet's try it:\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /\".+\"/g;\n\nlet str = 'a \"witch\" and her \"broom\" is one';\n\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // \"witch\" and her \"broom\"\n```\n\n...We can see that it works not as intended!\n\nInstead of finding two matches `match:\"witch\"` and `match:\"broom\"`, it finds one: `match:\"witch\" and her \"broom\"`.\n\nThat can be described as \"greediness is the cause of all evil\".\n\n## Greedy search\n\nTo find a match, the regular expression engine uses the following algorithm:\n\n- For every position in the string\n    - Try to match the pattern at that position.\n    - If there's no match, go to the next position.\n\nThese common words do not make it obvious why the regexp fails, so let's elaborate how the search works for the pattern `pattern:\".+\"`.\n\n1. The first pattern character is a quote `pattern:\"`.\n\n    The regular expression engine tries to find it at the zero position of the source string `subject:a \"witch\" and her \"broom\" is one`, but there's `subject:a` there, so there's immediately no match.\n\n    Then it advances: goes to the next positions in the source string and tries to find the first character of the pattern there, fails again, and finally finds the quote at the 3rd position:\n\n    ![](witch_greedy1.svg)\n\n2. The quote is detected, and then the engine tries to find a match for the rest of the pattern. It tries to see if the rest of the subject string conforms to `pattern:.+\"`.\n\n    In our case the next pattern character is `pattern:.` (a dot). It denotes \"any character except a newline\", so the next string letter `match:'w'` fits:\n\n    ![](witch_greedy2.svg)\n\n3. Then the dot repeats because of the quantifier `pattern:.+`. The regular expression engine adds to the match one character after another.\n\n    ...Until when? All characters match the dot, so it only stops when it reaches the end of the string:\n\n    ![](witch_greedy3.svg)\n\n4. Now the engine finished repeating `pattern:.+` and tries to find the next character of the pattern. It's the quote `pattern:\"`. But there's a problem: the string has finished, there are no more characters!\n\n    The regular expression engine understands that it took too many `pattern:.+` and starts to *backtrack*.\n\n    In other words, it shortens the match for the quantifier by one character:\n\n    ![](witch_greedy4.svg)\n\n    Now it assumes that `pattern:.+` ends one character before the string end and tries to match the rest of the pattern from that position.\n\n    If there were a quote there, then the search would end, but the last character is `subject:'e'`, so there's no match.\n\n5. ...So the engine decreases the number of repetitions of `pattern:.+` by one more character:\n\n    ![](witch_greedy5.svg)\n\n    The quote `pattern:'\"'` does not match `subject:'n'`.\n\n6. The engine keep backtracking: it decreases the count of repetition for `pattern:'.'` until the rest of the pattern (in our case `pattern:'\"'`) matches:\n\n    ![](witch_greedy6.svg)\n\n7. The match is complete.\n\n8. So the first match is `match:\"witch\" and her \"broom\"`. If the regular expression has flag `pattern:g`, then the search will continue from where the first match ends. There are no more quotes in the rest of the string `subject:is one`, so no more results.\n\nThat's probably not what we expected, but that's how it works.\n\n**In the greedy mode (by default) a quantifier is repeated as many times as possible.**\n\nThe regexp engine adds to the match as many characters as it can for `pattern:.+`, and then shortens that one by one, if the rest of the pattern doesn't match.\n\nFor our task we want another thing. That's where a lazy mode can help.\n\n## Lazy mode\n\nThe lazy mode of quantifiers is an opposite to the greedy mode. It means: \"repeat minimal number of times\".\n\nWe can enable it by putting a question mark `pattern:'?'` after the quantifier, so that it becomes  `pattern:*?` or `pattern:+?` or even `pattern:??` for `pattern:'?'`.\n\nTo make things clear: usually a question mark `pattern:?` is a quantifier by itself (zero or one), but if added *after another quantifier (or even itself)* it gets another meaning -- it switches the matching mode from greedy to lazy.\n\nThe regexp `pattern:/\".+?\"/g` works as intended: it finds `match:\"witch\"` and `match:\"broom\"`:\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /\".+?\"/g;\n\nlet str = 'a \"witch\" and her \"broom\" is one';\n\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // witch, broom\n```\n\nTo clearly understand the change, let's trace the search step by step.\n\n1. The first step is the same: it finds the pattern start `pattern:'\"'` at the 3rd position:\n\n    ![](witch_greedy1.svg)\n\n2. The next step is also similar: the engine finds a match for the dot `pattern:'.'`:\n\n    ![](witch_greedy2.svg)\n\n3. And now the search goes differently. Because we have a lazy mode for `pattern:+?`, the engine doesn't try to match a dot one more time, but stops and tries to match the rest of the pattern  `pattern:'\"'` right now:\n\n    ![](witch_lazy3.svg)\n\n    If there were a quote there, then the search would end, but there's `'i'`, so there's no match.\n4. Then the regular expression engine increases the number of repetitions for the dot and tries one more time:\n\n    ![](witch_lazy4.svg)\n\n    Failure again. Then the number of repetitions is increased again and again...\n5. ...Till the match for the rest of the pattern is found:\n\n    ![](witch_lazy5.svg)\n\n6. The next search starts from the end of the current match and yield one more result:\n\n    ![](witch_lazy6.svg)\n\nIn this example we saw how the lazy mode works for `pattern:+?`. Quantifiers `pattern:*?` and `pattern:??` work the similar way -- the regexp engine increases the number of repetitions only if the rest of the pattern can't match on the given position.\n\n**Laziness is only enabled for the quantifier with `?`.**\n\nOther quantifiers remain greedy.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"123 456\".match(/\\d+ \\d+?/) ); // 123 4\n```\n\n1. The pattern `pattern:\\d+` tries to match as many digits as it can (greedy mode), so it finds  `match:123` and stops, because the next character is a space `pattern:' '`.\n2. Then there's a space in the pattern, it matches.\n3. Then there's `pattern:\\d+?`. The quantifier is in lazy mode, so it finds one digit `match:4` and tries to check if the rest of the pattern matches from there.\n\n    ...But there's nothing in the pattern after `pattern:\\d+?`.\n\n    The lazy mode doesn't repeat anything without a need. The pattern finished, so we're done. We have a match `match:123 4`.\n\n```smart header=\"Optimizations\"\nModern regular expression engines can optimize internal algorithms to work faster. So they may work a bit differently from the described algorithm.\n\nBut to understand how regular expressions work and to build regular expressions, we don't need to know about that. They are only used internally to optimize things.\n\nComplex regular expressions are hard to optimize, so the search may work exactly as described as well.\n```\n\n## Alternative approach\n\nWith regexps, there's often more than one way to do the same thing.\n\nIn our case we can find quoted strings without lazy mode using the regexp `pattern:\"[^\"]+\"`:\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /\"[^\"]+\"/g;\n\nlet str = 'a \"witch\" and her \"broom\" is one';\n\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // witch, broom\n```\n\nThe regexp `pattern:\"[^\"]+\"` gives correct results, because it looks for a quote `pattern:'\"'` followed by one or more non-quotes `pattern:[^\"]`, and then the closing quote.\n\nWhen the regexp engine looks for `pattern:[^\"]+` it stops the repetitions when it meets the closing quote, and we're done.\n\nPlease note, that this logic does not replace lazy quantifiers!\n\nIt is just different. There are times when we need one or another.\n\n**Let's see an example where lazy quantifiers fail and this variant works right.**\n\nFor instance, we want to find links of the form `<a href=\"...\" class=\"doc\">`, with any `href`.\n\nWhich regular expression to use?\n\nThe first idea might be: `pattern:/<a href=\".*\" class=\"doc\">/g`.\n\nLet's check it:\n```js run\nlet str = '...<a href=\"link\" class=\"doc\">...';\nlet regexp = /<a href=\".*\" class=\"doc\">/g;\n\n// Works!\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // <a href=\"link\" class=\"doc\">\n```\n\nIt worked. But let's see what happens if there are many links in the text?\n\n```js run\nlet str = '...<a href=\"link1\" class=\"doc\">... <a href=\"link2\" class=\"doc\">...';\nlet regexp = /<a href=\".*\" class=\"doc\">/g;\n\n// Whoops! Two links in one match!\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // <a href=\"link1\" class=\"doc\">... <a href=\"link2\" class=\"doc\">\n```\n\nNow the result is wrong for the same reason as our \"witches\" example. The quantifier `pattern:.*` took too many characters.\n\nThe match looks like this:\n\n```html\n<a href=\".....................................\" class=\"doc\">\n<a href=\"link1\" class=\"doc\">... <a href=\"link2\" class=\"doc\">\n```\n\nLet's modify the pattern by making the quantifier `pattern:.*?` lazy:\n\n```js run\nlet str = '...<a href=\"link1\" class=\"doc\">... <a href=\"link2\" class=\"doc\">...';\nlet regexp = /<a href=\".*?\" class=\"doc\">/g;\n\n// Works!\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // <a href=\"link1\" class=\"doc\">, <a href=\"link2\" class=\"doc\">\n```\n\nNow it seems to work, there are two matches:\n\n```html\n<a href=\".....\" class=\"doc\">    <a href=\".....\" class=\"doc\">\n<a href=\"link1\" class=\"doc\">... <a href=\"link2\" class=\"doc\">\n```\n\n...But let's test it on one more text input:\n\n```js run\nlet str = '...<a href=\"link1\" class=\"wrong\">... <p style=\"\" class=\"doc\">...';\nlet regexp = /<a href=\".*?\" class=\"doc\">/g;\n\n// Wrong match!\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // <a href=\"link1\" class=\"wrong\">... <p style=\"\" class=\"doc\">\n```\n\nNow it fails. The match includes not just a link, but also a lot of text after it, including `<p...>`.\n\nWhy?\n\nThat's what's going on:\n\n1. First the regexp finds a link start `match:<a href=\"`.\n2. Then it looks for `pattern:.*?`: takes one character (lazily!), check if there's a match for `pattern:\" class=\"doc\">` (none).\n3. Then takes another character into `pattern:.*?`, and so on... until it finally reaches `match:\" class=\"doc\">`.\n\nBut the problem is: that's already beyond the link `<a...>`, in another tag `<p>`. Not what we want.\n\nHere's the picture of the match aligned with the text:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"...................................\" class=\"doc\">\n<a href=\"link1\" class=\"wrong\">... <p style=\"\" class=\"doc\">\n```\n\nSo, we need the pattern to look for `<a href=\"...something...\" class=\"doc\">`, but both greedy and lazy variants have problems.\n\nThe correct variant can be: `pattern:href=\"[^\"]*\"`. It will take all characters inside the `href` attribute till the nearest quote, just what we need.\n\nA working example:\n\n```js run\nlet str1 = '...<a href=\"link1\" class=\"wrong\">... <p style=\"\" class=\"doc\">...';\nlet str2 = '...<a href=\"link1\" class=\"doc\">... <a href=\"link2\" class=\"doc\">...';\nlet regexp = /<a href=\"[^\"]*\" class=\"doc\">/g;\n\n// Works!\nalert( str1.match(regexp) ); // null, no matches, that's correct\nalert( str2.match(regexp) ); // <a href=\"link1\" class=\"doc\">, <a href=\"link2\" class=\"doc\">\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nQuantifiers have two modes of work:\n\nGreedy\n: By default the regular expression engine tries to repeat the quantifier as many times as possible. For instance, `pattern:\\d+` consumes all possible digits. When it becomes impossible to consume more (no more digits or string end), then it continues to match the rest of the pattern. If there's no match then it decreases the number of repetitions (backtracks) and tries again.\n\nLazy\n: Enabled by the question mark `pattern:?` after the quantifier. The regexp engine tries to match the rest of the pattern before each repetition of the quantifier.\n\nAs we've seen, the lazy mode is not a \"panacea\" from the greedy search. An alternative is a \"fine-tuned\" greedy search, with exclusions, as in the pattern `pattern:\"[^\"]+\"`.",

        "content": "\n\nA part of a pattern can be enclosed in parentheses `pattern:(...)`. This is called a \"capturing group\".\n\nThat has two effects:\n\n1. It allows to get a part of the match as a separate item in the result array.\n2. If we put a quantifier after the parentheses, it applies to the parentheses as a whole.\n\n## Examples\n\nLet's see how parentheses work in examples.\n\n### Example: gogogo\n\nWithout parentheses, the pattern `pattern:go+` means `subject:g` character, followed by `subject:o` repeated one or more times. For instance, `match:goooo` or `match:gooooooooo`.\n\nParentheses group characters together, so `pattern:(go)+` means `match:go`, `match:gogo`, `match:gogogo` and so on.\n\n```js run\nalert( 'Gogogo now!'.match(/(go)+/ig) ); // \"Gogogo\"\n```\n\n### Example: domain\n\nLet's make something more complex -- a regular expression to search for a website domain.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nmail.com\nusers.mail.com\nsmith.users.mail.com\n```\n\nAs we can see, a domain consists of repeated words, a dot after each one except the last one.\n\nIn regular expressions that's `pattern:(\\w+\\.)+\\w+`:\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /(\\w+\\.)+\\w+/g;\n\nalert( \"site.com my.site.com\".match(regexp) ); // site.com,my.site.com\n```\n\nThe search works, but the pattern can't match a domain with a hyphen, e.g. `my-site.com`, because the hyphen does not belong to class `pattern:\\w`.\n\nWe can fix it by replacing `pattern:\\w` with `pattern:[\\w-]` in every word except the last one: `pattern:([\\w-]+\\.)+\\w+`.\n\n### Example: email\n\nThe previous example can be extended. We can create a regular expression for emails based on it.\n\nThe email format is: `name@domain`. Any word can be the name, hyphens and dots are allowed. In regular expressions that's `pattern:[-.\\w]+`.\n\nThe pattern:\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /[-.\\w]+@([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]+/g;\n\nalert(\"my@mail.com @ his@site.com.uk\".match(regexp)); // my@mail.com, his@site.com.uk\n```\n\nThat regexp is not perfect, but mostly works and helps to fix accidental mistypes. The only truly reliable check for an email can only be done by sending a letter.\n\n## Parentheses contents in the match\n\nParentheses are numbered from left to right. The search engine memorizes the content matched by each of them and allows to get it in the result.\n\nThe method `str.match(regexp)`, if `regexp` has no flag `g`, looks for the first match and returns it as an array:\n\n1. At index `0`: the full match.\n2. At index `1`: the contents of the first parentheses.\n3. At index `2`: the contents of the second parentheses.\n4. ...and so on...\n\nFor instance, we'd like to find HTML tags `pattern:<.*?>`, and process them. It would be convenient to have tag content (what's inside the angles), in a separate variable.\n\nLet's wrap the inner content into parentheses, like this: `pattern:<(.*?)>`.\n\nNow we'll get both the tag as a whole `match:<h1>` and its contents `match:h1` in the resulting array:\n\n```js run\nlet str = '<h1>Hello, world!</h1>';\n\nlet tag = str.match(/<(.*?)>/);\n\nalert( tag[0] ); // <h1>\nalert( tag[1] ); // h1\n```\n\n### Nested groups\n\nParentheses can be nested. In this case the numbering also goes from left to right.\n\nFor instance, when searching a tag in `subject:<span class=\"my\">` we may be interested in:\n\n1. The tag content as a whole: `match:span class=\"my\"`.\n2. The tag name: `match:span`.\n3. The tag attributes: `match:class=\"my\"`.\n\nLet's add parentheses for them: `pattern:<(([a-z]+)\\s*([^>]*))>`.\n\nHere's how they are numbered (left to right, by the opening paren):\n\n![](regexp-nested-groups-pattern.svg)\n\nIn action:\n\n```js run\nlet str = '<span class=\"my\">';\n\nlet regexp = /<(([a-z]+)\\s*([^>]*))>/;\n\nlet result = str.match(regexp);\nalert(result[0]); // <span class=\"my\">\nalert(result[1]); // span class=\"my\"\nalert(result[2]); // span\nalert(result[3]); // class=\"my\"\n```\n\nThe zero index of `result` always holds the full match.\n\nThen groups, numbered from left to right by an opening paren. The first group is returned as `result[1]`. Here it encloses the whole tag content.\n\nThen in `result[2]` goes the group from the second opening paren `pattern:([a-z]+)` - tag name, then in `result[3]` the tag: `pattern:([^>]*)`.\n\nThe contents of every group in the string:\n\n![](regexp-nested-groups-matches.svg)\n\n### Optional groups\n\nEven if a group is optional and doesn't exist in the match (e.g. has the quantifier `pattern:(...)?`), the corresponding `result` array item is present and equals `undefined`.\n\nFor instance, let's consider the regexp `pattern:a(z)?(c)?`. It looks for `\"a\"` optionally followed by `\"z\"` optionally followed by `\"c\"`.\n\nIf we run it on the string with a single letter `subject:a`, then the result is:\n\n```js run\nlet match = 'a'.match(/a(z)?(c)?/);\n\nalert( match.length ); // 3\nalert( match[0] ); // a (whole match)\nalert( match[1] ); // undefined\nalert( match[2] ); // undefined\n```\n\nThe array has the length of `3`, but all groups are empty.\n\nAnd here's a more complex match for the string `subject:ac`:\n\n```js run\nlet match = 'ac'.match(/a(z)?(c)?/)\n\nalert( match.length ); // 3\nalert( match[0] ); // ac (whole match)\nalert( match[1] ); // undefined, because there's nothing for (z)?\nalert( match[2] ); // c\n```\n\nThe array length is permanent: `3`. But there's nothing for the group `pattern:(z)?`, so the result is `[\"ac\", undefined, \"c\"]`.\n\n## Searching for all matches with groups: matchAll\n\n```warn header=\"`matchAll` is a new method, polyfill may be needed\"\nThe method `matchAll` is not supported in old browsers.\n\nA polyfill may be required, such as <https://github.com/ljharb/String.prototype.matchAll>.\n```\n\nWhen we search for all matches (flag `pattern:g`), the `match` method does not return contents for groups.\n\nFor example, let's find all tags in a string:\n\n```js run\nlet str = '<h1> <h2>';\n\nlet tags = str.match(/<(.*?)>/g);\n\nalert( tags ); // <h1>,<h2>\n```\n\nThe result is an array of matches, but without details about each of them. But in practice we usually need contents of capturing groups in the result.\n\nTo get them, we should search using the method `str.matchAll(regexp)`.\n\nIt was added to JavaScript language long after `match`, as its \"new and improved version\".\n\nJust like `match`, it looks for matches, but there are 3 differences:\n\n1. It returns not an array, but an iterable object.\n2. When the flag `pattern:g` is present, it returns every match as an array with groups.\n3. If there are no matches, it returns not `null`, but an empty iterable object.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet results = '<h1> <h2>'.matchAll(/<(.*?)>/gi);\n\n// results - is not an array, but an iterable object\nalert(results); // [object RegExp String Iterator]\n\nalert(results[0]); // undefined (*)\n\nresults = Array.from(results); // let's turn it into array\n\nalert(results[0]); // <h1>,h1 (1st tag)\nalert(results[1]); // <h2>,h2 (2nd tag)\n```\n\nAs we can see, the first difference is very important, as demonstrated in the line `(*)`. We can't get the match as `results[0]`, because that object isn't pseudoarray. We can turn it into a real `Array` using `Array.from`. There are more details about pseudoarrays and iterables in the article <info:iterable>.\n\nThere's no need in `Array.from` if we're looping over results:\n\n```js run\nlet results = '<h1> <h2>'.matchAll(/<(.*?)>/gi);\n\nfor(let result of results) {\n  alert(result);\n  // first alert: <h1>,h1\n  // second: <h2>,h2\n}\n```\n\n...Or using destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet [tag1, tag2] = '<h1> <h2>'.matchAll(/<(.*?)>/gi);\n```\n\nEvery match, returned by `matchAll`, has the same format as returned by `match` without flag `pattern:g`: it's an array with additional properties `index` (match index in the string) and `input` (source string):\n\n```js run\nlet results = '<h1> <h2>'.matchAll(/<(.*?)>/gi);\n\nlet [tag1, tag2] = results;\n\nalert( tag1[0] ); // <h1>\nalert( tag1[1] ); // h1\nalert( tag1.index ); // 0\nalert( tag1.input ); // <h1> <h2>\n```\n\n```smart header=\"Why is a result of `matchAll` an iterable object, not an array?\"\nWhy is the method designed like that? The reason is simple - for the optimization.\n\nThe call to `matchAll` does not perform the search. Instead, it returns an iterable object, without the results initially. The search is performed each time we iterate over it, e.g. in the loop.\n\nSo, there will be found as many results as needed, not more.\n\nE.g. there are potentially 100 matches in the text, but in a `for..of` loop we found 5 of them, then decided it's enough and make a `break`. Then the engine won't spend time finding other 95 matches.\n```\n\n## Named groups\n\nRemembering groups by their numbers is hard. For simple patterns it's doable, but for more complex ones counting parentheses is inconvenient. We have a much better option: give names to parentheses.\n\nThat's done by putting `pattern:?<name>` immediately after the opening paren.\n\nFor example, let's look for a date in the format \"year-month-day\":\n\n```js run\n*!*\nlet dateRegexp = /(?<year>[0-9]{4})-(?<month>[0-9]{2})-(?<day>[0-9]{2})/;\n*/!*\nlet str = \"2019-04-30\";\n\nlet groups = str.match(dateRegexp).groups;\n\nalert(groups.year); // 2019\nalert(groups.month); // 04\nalert(groups.day); // 30\n```\n\nAs you can see, the groups reside in the `.groups` property of the match.\n\nTo look for all dates, we can add flag `pattern:g`.\n\nWe'll also need `matchAll` to obtain full matches, together with groups:\n\n```js run\nlet dateRegexp = /(?<year>[0-9]{4})-(?<month>[0-9]{2})-(?<day>[0-9]{2})/g;\n\nlet str = \"2019-10-30 2020-01-01\";\n\nlet results = str.matchAll(dateRegexp);\n\nfor(let result of results) {\n  let {year, month, day} = result.groups;\n\n  alert(`${day}.${month}.${year}`);\n  // first alert: 30.10.2019\n  // second: 01.01.2020\n}\n```\n\n## Capturing groups in replacement\n\nMethod `str.replace(regexp, replacement)` that replaces all matches with `regexp` in `str` allows to use parentheses contents in the `replacement` string. That's done using `pattern:$n`, where `pattern:n` is the group number.\n\nFor example,\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"John Bull\";\nlet regexp = /(\\w+) (\\w+)/;\n\nalert( str.replace(regexp, '$2, $1') ); // Bull, John\n```\n\nFor named parentheses the reference will be `pattern:$<name>`.\n\nFor example, let's reformat dates from \"year-month-day\" to \"day.month.year\":\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /(?<year>[0-9]{4})-(?<month>[0-9]{2})-(?<day>[0-9]{2})/g;\n\nlet str = \"2019-10-30, 2020-01-01\";\n\nalert( str.replace(regexp, '$<day>.$<month>.$<year>') );\n// 30.10.2019, 01.01.2020\n```\n\n## Non-capturing groups with ?:\n\nSometimes we need parentheses to correctly apply a quantifier, but we don't want their contents in results.\n\nA group may be excluded by adding `pattern:?:` in the beginning.\n\nFor instance, if we want to find `pattern:(go)+`, but don't want the parentheses contents (`go`) as a separate array item, we can write: `pattern:(?:go)+`.\n\nIn the example below we only get the name `match:John` as a separate member of the match:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"Gogogo John!\";\n\n*!*\n// ?: exludes 'go' from capturing\nlet regexp = /(?:go)+ (\\w+)/i;\n*/!*\n\nlet result = str.match(regexp);\n\nalert( result[0] ); // Gogogo John (full match)\nalert( result[1] ); // John\nalert( result.length ); // 2 (no more items in the array)\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nParentheses group together a part of the regular expression, so that the quantifier applies to it as a whole.\n\nParentheses groups are numbered left-to-right, and can optionally be named with  `(?<name>...)`.\n\nThe content, matched by a group, can be obtained in the results:\n\n- The method `str.match` returns capturing groups only without flag `pattern:g`.\n- The method `str.matchAll` always returns capturing groups.\n\nIf the parentheses have no name, then their contents is available in the match array by its number. Named parentheses are also available in the property `groups`.\n\nWe can also use parentheses contents in the replacement string in `str.replace`: by the number `$n` or the name `$<name>`.\n\nA group may be excluded from numbering by adding `pattern:?:` in its start. That's used when we need to apply a quantifier to the whole group, but don't want it as a separate item in the results array. We also can't reference such parentheses in the replacement string.",

That would lead to incorrect matches when one quote appears inside other ones, like in the string `subject:\"She's the one!\"`:\n\n```js run\nlet str = `He said: \"She's the one!\".`;\n\nlet regexp = /['\"](.*?)['\"]/g;\n\n// The result is not what we'd like to have\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // \"She'\n```\n\nAs we can see, the pattern found an opening quote `match:\"`, then the text is consumed till the other quote `match:'`, that closes the match.\n\nTo make sure that the pattern looks for the closing quote exactly the same as the opening one, we can wrap it into a capturing group and backreference it: `pattern:(['\"])(.*?)\\1`.\n\nHere's the correct code:\n\n```js run\nlet str = `He said: \"She's the one!\".`;\n\n*!*\nlet regexp = /(['\"])(.*?)\\1/g;\n*/!*\n\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // \"She's the one!\"\n```\n\nNow it works! The regular expression engine finds the first quote `pattern:(['\"])` and memorizes its content. That's the first capturing group.\n\nFurther in the pattern `pattern:\\1` means \"find the same text as in the first group\", exactly the same quote in our case.\n\nSimilar to that, `pattern:\\2` would mean the contents of the second group, `pattern:\\3` - the 3rd group, and so on.\n\n```smart\nIf we use `?:` in the group, then we can't reference it. Groups that are excluded from capturing `(?:...)` are not memorized by the engine.\n```\n\n```warn header=\"Don't mess up: in the pattern `pattern:\\1`, in the replacement: `pattern:$1`\"\nIn the replacement string we use a dollar sign: `pattern:$1`, while in the pattern - a backslash `pattern:\\1`.\n```\n\n## Backreference by name: `\\k<name>`\n\nIf a regexp has many parentheses, it's convenient to give them names.\n\nTo reference a named group we can use `pattern:\\k<name>`.\n\nIn the example below the group with quotes is named `pattern:?<quote>`, so the backreference is `pattern:\\k<quote>`:\n\n```js run\nlet str = `He said: \"She's the one!\".`;\n\n*!*\nlet regexp = /(?<quote>['\"])(.*?)\\k<quote>/g;\n*/!*\n\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // \"She's the one!\"\n```",

        "content": "\n\nAlternation is the term in regular expression that is actually a simple \"OR\".\n\nIn a regular expression it is denoted with a vertical line character `pattern:|`.\n\nFor instance, we need to find programming languages: HTML, PHP, Java or JavaScript.\n\nThe corresponding regexp: `pattern:html|php|java(script)?`.\n\nA usage example:\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /html|php|css|java(script)?/gi;\n\nlet str = \"First HTML appeared, then CSS, then JavaScript\";\n\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // 'HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript'\n```\n\nWe already saw a similar thing -- square brackets. They allow to choose between multiple characters, for instance `pattern:gr[ae]y` matches `match:gray` or `match:grey`.\n\nSquare brackets allow only characters or character sets. Alternation allows any expressions. A regexp `pattern:A|B|C` means one of expressions `A`, `B` or `C`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- `pattern:gr(a|e)y` means exactly the same as `pattern:gr[ae]y`.\n- `pattern:gra|ey` means `match:gra` or `match:ey`.\n\nTo apply alternation to a chosen part of the pattern, we can enclose it in parentheses:\n- `pattern:I love HTML|CSS` matches `match:I love HTML` or `match:CSS`.\n- `pattern:I love (HTML|CSS)` matches `match:I love HTML` or `match:I love CSS`.\n\n## Example: regexp for time\n\nIn previous articles there was a task to build a regexp for searching time in the form `hh:mm`, for instance `12:00`. But a simple `pattern:\\d\\d:\\d\\d` is too vague. It accepts `25:99` as the time (as 99 seconds match the pattern, but that time is invalid).\n\nHow can we make a better pattern?\n\nWe can use more careful matching. First, the hours:\n\n- If the first digit is `0` or `1`, then the next digit can be any: `pattern:[01]\\d`.\n- Otherwise, if the first digit is `2`, then the next must be `pattern:[0-3]`.\n- (no other first digit is allowed)\n\nWe can write both variants in a regexp using alternation: `pattern:[01]\\d|2[0-3]`.\n\nNext, minutes must be from `00` to `59`. In the regular expression language that can be written as `pattern:[0-5]\\d`: the first digit `0-5`, and then any digit.\n\nIf we glue minutes and seconds together, we get the pattern: `pattern:[01]\\d|2[0-3]:[0-5]\\d`.\n\nWe're almost done, but there's a problem. The alternation `pattern:|` now happens to be between `pattern:[01]\\d` and `pattern:2[0-3]:[0-5]\\d`.\n\nThat is: minutes are added to the second alternation variant, here's a clear picture:\n\n```\n[01]\\d  |  2[0-3]:[0-5]\\d\n```\n\nThat pattern looks for `pattern:[01]\\d` or `pattern:2[0-3]:[0-5]\\d`.\n\nBut that's wrong, the alternation should only be used in the \"hours\" part of the regular expression, to allow `pattern:[01]\\d` OR `pattern:2[0-3]`. Let's correct that by enclosing \"hours\" into parentheses: `pattern:([01]\\d|2[0-3]):[0-5]\\d`.\n\nThe final solution:\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /([01]\\d|2[0-3]):[0-5]\\d/g;\n\nalert(\"00:00 10:10 23:59 25:99 1:2\".match(regexp)); // 00:00,10:10,23:59\n```",

That is: a number, followed by `subject:€` sign.\n\n## Lookahead\n\nThe syntax is: `pattern:X(?=Y)`, it means \"look for `pattern:X`, but match only if followed by `pattern:Y`\". There may be any pattern instead of `pattern:X` and `pattern:Y`.\n\nFor an integer number followed by `subject:€`, the regexp will be `pattern:\\d+(?=€)`:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"1 turkey costs 30€\";\n\nalert( str.match(/\\d+(?=€)/) ); // 30, the number 1 is ignored, as it's not followed by €\n```\n\nPlease note: the lookahead is merely a test, the contents of the parentheses `pattern:(?=...)` is not included in the result `match:30`.\n\nWhen we look for `pattern:X(?=Y)`, the regular expression engine finds `pattern:X` and then checks if there's `pattern:Y` immediately after it. If it's not so, then the potential match is skipped, and the search continues.\n\nMore complex tests are possible, e.g. `pattern:X(?=Y)(?=Z)` means:\n\n1. Find `pattern:X`.\n2. Check if `pattern:Y` is immediately after `pattern:X` (skip if isn't).\n3. Check if `pattern:Z` is also immediately after `pattern:X` (skip if isn't).\n4. If both tests passed, then the `pattern:X` is a match, otherwise continue searching.\n\nIn other words, such pattern means that we're looking for `pattern:X` followed by `pattern:Y` and `pattern:Z` at the same time.\n\nThat's only possible if patterns `pattern:Y` and `pattern:Z` aren't mutually exclusive.\n\nFor example, `pattern:\\d+(?=\\s)(?=.*30)` looks for `pattern:\\d+` only if it's followed by a space, and there's `30` somewhere after it:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"1 turkey costs 30€\";\n\nalert( str.match(/\\d+(?=\\s)(?=.*30)/) ); // 1\n```\n\nIn our string that exactly matches the number `1`.\n\n## Negative lookahead\n\nLet's say that we want a quantity instead, not a price from the same string. That's a number `pattern:\\d+`, NOT followed by `subject:€`.\n\nFor that, a negative lookahead can be applied.\n\nThe syntax is: `pattern:X(?!Y)`, it means \"search `pattern:X`, but only if not followed by `pattern:Y`\".\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"2 turkeys cost 60€\";\n\nalert( str.match(/\\d+(?!€)/) ); // 2 (the price is skipped)\n```\n\n## Lookbehind\n\nLookahead allows to add a condition for \"what follows\".\n\nLookbehind is similar, but it looks behind. That is, it allows to match a pattern only if there's something before it.\n\nThe syntax is:\n- Positive lookbehind: `pattern:(?<=Y)X`, matches `pattern:X`, but only if there's  `pattern:Y` before it.\n- Negative lookbehind: `pattern:(?<!Y)X`, matches `pattern:X`, but only if there's no `pattern:Y` before it.\n\nFor example, let's change the price to US dollars. The dollar sign is usually before the number, so to look for `$30` we'll use `pattern:(?<=\\$)\\d+` -- an amount preceded by `subject:$`:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"1 turkey costs $30\";\n\n// the dollar sign is escaped \\$\nalert( str.match(/(?<=\\$)\\d+/) ); // 30 (skipped the sole number)\n```\n\nAnd, if we need the quantity -- a number, not preceded by `subject:$`, then we can use a negative lookbehind `pattern:(?<!\\$)\\d+`:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"2 turkeys cost $60\";\n\nalert( str.match(/(?<!\\$)\\d+/) ); // 2 (skipped the price)\n```\n\n## Capturing groups\n\nGenerally, the contents inside lookaround parentheses does not become a part of the result.\n\nE.g. in the pattern `pattern:\\d+(?=€)`, the `pattern:€` sign doesn't get captured as a part of the match. That's natural: we look for a number `pattern:\\d+`, while `pattern:(?=€)` is just a test that it should be followed by `subject:€`.\n\nBut in some situations we might want to capture the lookaround expression as well, or a part of it. That's possible. Just wrap that part into additional parentheses.\n\nIn the example below the currency sign `pattern:(€|kr)` is captured, along with the amount:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"1 turkey costs 30€\";\nlet regexp = /\\d+(?=(€|kr))/; // extra parentheses around €|kr\n\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // 30, €\n```\n\nAnd here's the same for lookbehind:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"1 turkey costs $30\";\nlet regexp = /(?<=(\\$|£))\\d+/;\n\nalert( str.match(regexp) ); // 30, $\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nLookahead and lookbehind (commonly referred to as \"lookaround\") are useful when we'd like to match something depending on the context before/after it.\n\nFor simple regexps we can do the similar thing manually. That is: match everything, in any context, and then filter by context in the loop.\n\nRemember, `str.match` (without flag `pattern:g`) and `str.matchAll` (always) return matches as arrays with `index` property, so we know where exactly in the text it is, and can check the context.\n\nBut generally lookaround is more convenient.\n\nLookaround types:\n\n| Pattern            | type             | matches |\n|--------------------|------------------|---------|\n| `X(?=Y)`   | Positive lookahead | `pattern:X` if followed by `pattern:Y` |\n| `X(?!Y)`   | Negative lookahead | `pattern:X` if not followed by `pattern:Y` |\n| `(?<=Y)X` |  Positive lookbehind | `pattern:X` if after `pattern:Y` |\n| `(?<!Y)X` | Negative lookbehind | `pattern:X` if not after `pattern:Y` |",

        "content": "\n\nSome regular expressions are looking simple, but can execute veeeeeery long time, and even \"hang\" the JavaScript engine.\n\nSooner or later most developers occasionally face such behavior, because it's quite easy to create such a regexp.\n\nThe typical symptom -- a regular expression works fine sometimes, but for certain strings it \"hangs\", consuming 100% of CPU.\n\nIn such case a web-browser suggests to kill the script and reload the page. Not a good thing for sure.\n\nFor server-side JavaScript it may become a vulnerability if regular expressions process user data.\n\n## Example\n\nLet's say we have a string, and we'd like to check if it consists of words  `pattern:\\w+` with an optional space `pattern:\\s?` after each.\n\nWe'll use a regexp `pattern:^(\\w+\\s?)*$`, it specifies 0 or more such words.\n\nIn action:\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /^(\\w+\\s?)*$/;\n\nalert( regexp.test(\"A good string\") ); // true\nalert( regexp.test(\"Bad characters: $@#\") ); // false\n```\n\nIt seems to work. The result is correct. Although, on certain strings it takes a lot of time. So long that JavaScript engine \"hangs\" with 100% CPU consumption.\n\nIf you run the example below, you probably won't see anything, as JavaScript will just \"hang\". A web-browser will stop reacting on events, the UI will stop working. After some time it will suggest to reloaad the page. So be careful with this:\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /^(\\w+\\s?)*$/;\nlet str = \"An input string that takes a long time or even makes this regexp to hang!\";\n\n// will take a very long time\nalert( regexp.test(str) );\n```\n\nSome regular expression engines can handle such search, but most of them can't.\n\n## Simplified example\n\nWhat's the matter? Why the regular expression \"hangs\"?\n\nTo understand that, let's simplify the example: remove spaces `pattern:\\s?`. Then it becomes `pattern:^(\\w+)*$`.\n\nAnd, to make things more obvious, let's replace `pattern:\\w` with `pattern:\\d`. The resulting regular expression still hangs, for instance:\n\n<!-- let str = `AnInputStringThatMakesItHang!`; -->\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /^(\\d+)*$/;\n\nlet str = \"012345678901234567890123456789!\";\n\n// will take a very long time\nalert( regexp.test(str) );\n```\n\nSo what's wrong with the regexp?\n\nFirst, one may notice that the regexp `pattern:(\\d+)*` is a little bit strange. The quantifier `pattern:*` looks extraneous. If we want a number, we can use `pattern:\\d+`.\n\nIndeed, the regexp is artificial. But the reason why it is slow is the same as those we saw above. So let's understand it, and then the previous example will become obvious.\n\nWhat happens during the search of `pattern:^(\\d+)*$` in the line `subject:123456789!` (shortened a bit for clarity), why does it take so long?\n\n1. First, the regexp engine tries to find a number `pattern:\\d+`. The plus `pattern:+` is greedy by default, so it consumes all digits:\n\n    ```\n    \\d+.......\n    (123456789)z\n    ```\n\n    Then it tries to apply the star quantifier, but there are no more digits, so it the star doesn't give anything.\n\n    The next in the pattern is the string end `pattern:$`, but in the text we have `subject:!`, so there's no match:\n\n    ```\n               X\n    \\d+........$\n    (123456789)!\n    ```\n\n2. As there's no match, the greedy quantifier `pattern:+` decreases the count of repetitions, backtracks one character back.\n\n    Now `pattern:\\d+` takes all digits except the last one:\n    ```\n    \\d+.......\n    (12345678)9!\n    ```\n3. Then the engine tries to continue the search from the new position (`9`).\n\n    The star `pattern:(\\d+)*` can be applied -- it gives the number `match:9`:\n\n    ```\n\n    \\d+.......\\d+\n    (12345678)(9)!\n    ```\n\n    The engine tries to match `pattern:$` again, but fails, because meets `subject:!`:\n\n    ```\n                 X\n    \\d+.......\\d+\n    (12345678)(9)z\n    ```\n\n\n4. There's no match, so the engine will continue backtracking, decreasing the number of repetitions. Backtracking generally works like this: the last greedy quantifier decreases the number of repetitions until it can. Then the previous greedy quantifier decreases, and so on.\n\n    All possible combinations are attempted. Here are their examples.\n\n    The first number `pattern:\\d+` has 7 digits, and then a number of 2 digits:\n\n    ```\n                 X\n    \\d+......\\d+\n    (1234567)(89)!\n    ```\n\n    The first number has 7 digits, and then two numbers of 1 digit each:\n\n    ```\n                   X\n    \\d+......\\d+\\d+\n    (1234567)(8)(9)!\n    ```\n\n    The first number has 6 digits, and then a number of 3 digits:\n\n    ```\n                 X\n    \\d+.......\\d+\n    (123456)(789)!\n    ```\n\n    The first number has 6 digits, and then 2 numbers:\n\n    ```\n                   X\n    \\d+.....\\d+ \\d+\n    (123456)(78)(9)!\n    ```\n\n    ...And so on.\n\n\nThere are many ways to split a set of digits `123456789` into numbers. To be precise, there are <code>2<sup>n</sup>-1</code>, where `n` is the length of the set.\n\nFor `n=20` there are about 1 million combinations, for `n=30` - a thousand times more. Trying each of them is exactly the reason why the search takes so long.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nShould we turn on the lazy mode?\n\nUnfortunately, that won't help: if we replace `pattern:\\d+` with `pattern:\\d+?`, the regexp will still hang. The order of combinations will change, but not their total count.\n\nSome regular expression engines have tricky tests and finite automations that allow to avoid going through all combinations or make it much faster, but not all engines, and not in all cases.\n\n## Back to words and strings\n\nThe similar thing happens in our first example, when we look words by pattern `pattern:^(\\w+\\s?)*$` in the string `subject:An input that hangs!`.\n\nThe reason is that a word can be represented as one `pattern:\\w+` or many:\n\n```\n(input)\n(inpu)(t)\n(inp)(u)(t)\n(in)(p)(ut)\n...\n```\n\nFor a human, it's obvious that there may be no match, because the string ends with an exclamation sign `!`, but the regular expression expects a wordly character `pattern:\\w` or a space `pattern:\\s` at the end. But the engine doesn't know that.\n\nIt tries all combinations of how the regexp `pattern:(\\w+\\s?)*` can \"consume\" the string, including variants with spaces `pattern:(\\w+\\s)*` and without them `pattern:(\\w+)*` (because spaces `pattern:\\s?` are optional). As there are many such combinations, the search takes a lot of time.\n\n## How to fix?\n\nThere are two main approaches to fixing the problem.\n\nThe first is to lower the number of possible combinations.\n\nLet's rewrite the regular expression as `pattern:^(\\w+\\s)*\\w*` - we'll look for any number of words followed by a space `pattern:(\\w+\\s)*`, and then (optionally) a word `pattern:\\w*`.\n\nThis regexp is equivalent to the previous one (matches the same) and works well:\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /^(\\w+\\s)*\\w*$/;\nlet str = \"An input string that takes a long time or even makes this regex to hang!\";\n\nalert( regexp.test(str) ); // false\n```\n\nWhy did the problem disappear?\n\nNow the star `pattern:*` goes after `pattern:\\w+\\s` instead of `pattern:\\w+\\s?`. It became impossible to represent one word of the string with multiple successive `pattern:\\w+`. The time needed to try such combinations is now saved.\n\nFor example, the previous pattern `pattern:(\\w+\\s?)*` could match the word `subject:string` as two `pattern:\\w+`:\n\n```js run\n\\w+\\w+\nstring\n```\n\nThe previous pattern, due to the optional `pattern:\\s` allowed variants `pattern:\\w+`, `pattern:\\w+\\s`, `pattern:\\w+\\w+` and so on.\n\nWith the rewritten pattern `pattern:(\\w+\\s)*`, that's impossible: there may be  `pattern:\\w+\\s` or `pattern:\\w+\\s\\w+\\s`, but not `pattern:\\w+\\w+`. So the overall combinations count is greatly decreased.\n\n## Preventing backtracking\n\nIt's not always convenient to rewrite a regexp. And it's not always obvious how to do it.\n\nThe alternative approach is to forbid backtracking for the quantifier.\n\nThe regular expressions engine tries many combinations that are obviously wrong for a human.\n\nE.g. in the regexp `pattern:(\\d+)*$` it's obvious for a human, that `pattern:+` shouldn't backtrack. If we replace one `pattern:\\d+` with two separate `pattern:\\d+\\d+`, nothing changes:\n\n```\n\\d+........\n(123456789)!\n\n\\d+...\\d+....\n(1234)(56789)!\n```\n\nAnd in the original example `pattern:^(\\w+\\s?)*$` we may want to forbid backtracking in `pattern:\\w+`. That is: `pattern:\\w+` should match a whole word, with the maximal possible length. There's no need to lower the repetitions count in `pattern:\\w+`, try to split it into two words `pattern:\\w+\\w+` and so on.\n\nModern regular expression engines support possessive quantifiers for that. They are like greedy ones, but don't backtrack (so they are actually simpler than regular quantifiers).\n\nThere are also so-called \"atomic capturing groups\" - a way to disable backtracking inside parentheses.\n\nUnfortunately, in JavaScript they are not supported. But there's another way.\n\n### Lookahead to the rescue!\n\nWe can prevent backtracking using lookahead.\n\nThe pattern to take as much repetitions of `pattern:\\w` as possible without backtracking is: `pattern:(?=(\\w+))\\1`.\n\nLet's decipher it:\n- Lookahead `pattern:?=` looks forward for the longest word `pattern:\\w+` starting at the current position.\n- The contents of parentheses with `pattern:?=...` isn't memorized by the engine, so wrap `pattern:\\w+` into parentheses. Then the engine will memorize their contents\n- ...And allow us to reference it in the pattern as `pattern:\\1`.\n\nThat is: we look ahead - and if there's a word `pattern:\\w+`, then match it as `pattern:\\1`.\n\nWhy? That's because the lookahead finds a word `pattern:\\w+` as a whole and we capture it into the pattern with `pattern:\\1`. So we essentially implemented a possessive plus `pattern:+` quantifier. It captures only the whole word `pattern:\\w+`, not a part of it.\n\nFor instance, in the word `subject:JavaScript` it may not only match `match:Java`, but leave out `match:Script` to match the rest of the pattern.\n\nHere's the comparison of two patterns:\n\n```js run\nalert( \"JavaScript\".match(/\\w+Script/)); // JavaScript\nalert( \"JavaScript\".match(/(?=(\\w+))\\1Script/)); // null\n```\n\n1. In the first variant `pattern:\\w+` first captures the whole word `subject:JavaScript` but then `pattern:+` backtracks character by character, to try to match the rest of the pattern, until it finally succeeds (when `pattern:\\w+` matches `match:Java`).\n2. In the second variant `pattern:(?=(\\w+))` looks ahead and finds the word  `subject:JavaScript`, that is included into the pattern as a whole by `pattern:\\1`, so there remains no way to find `subject:Script` after it.\n\nWe can put a more complex regular expression into `pattern:(?=(\\w+))\\1` instead of `pattern:\\w`, when we need to forbid backtracking for `pattern:+` after it.\n\n```smart\nThere's more about the relation between possessive quantifiers and lookahead in articles [Regex: Emulate Atomic Grouping (and Possessive Quantifiers) with LookAhead](http://instanceof.me/post/52245507631/regex-emulate-atomic-grouping-with-lookahead) and [Mimicking Atomic Groups](http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/mimic-atomic-groups).\n```\n\nLet's rewrite the first example using lookahead to prevent backtracking:\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /^((?=(\\w+))\\2\\s?)*$/;\n\nalert( regexp.test(\"A good string\") ); // true\n\nlet str = \"An input string that takes a long time or even makes this regex to hang!\";\n\nalert( regexp.test(str) ); // false, works and fast!\n```\n\nHere `pattern:\\2` is used instead of `pattern:\\1`, because there are additional outer parentheses. To avoid messing up with the numbers, we can give the parentheses a name, e.g. `pattern:(?<word>\\w+)`.\n\n```js run\n// parentheses are named ?<word>, referenced as \\k<word>\nlet regexp = /^((?=(?<word>\\w+))\\k<word>\\s?)*$/;\n\nlet str = \"An input string that takes a long time or even makes this regex to hang!\";\n\nalert( regexp.test(str) ); // false\n\nalert( regexp.test(\"A correct string\") ); // true\n```\n\nThe problem described in this article is called \"catastrophic backtracking\".\n\nWe covered two ways how to solve it:\n- Rewrite the regexp to lower the possible combinations count.\n- Prevent backtracking.",

        "content": "\n\nThe flag `pattern:y` allows to perform the search at the given position in the source string.\n\nTo grasp the use case of `pattern:y` flag, and see how great it is, let's explore a practical use case.\n\nOne of common tasks for regexps is \"lexical analysis\": we get a text, e.g. in a programming language, and analyze it for structural elements.\n\nFor instance, HTML has tags and attributes, JavaScript code has functions, variables, and so on.\n\nWriting lexical analyzers is a special area, with its own tools and algorithms, so we don't go deep in there, but there's a common task: to read something at the given position.\n\nE.g. we have a code string `subject:let varName = \"value\"`, and we need to read the variable name from it, that starts at position `4`.\n\nWe'll look for variable name using regexp `pattern:\\w+`. Actually, JavaScript variable names need a bit more complex regexp for accurate matching, but here it doesn't matter.\n\nA call to `str.match(/\\w+/)` will find only the first word in the line. Or all words with the flag `pattern:g`. But we need only one word at position `4`.\n\nTo search from the given position, we can use method `regexp.exec(str)`.\n\nIf the `regexp` doesn't have flags `pattern:g` or `pattern:y`, then this method looks for the first match in the string `str`, exactly like `str.match(regexp)`. Such simple no-flags case doesn't interest us here.\n\nIf there's flag `pattern:g`, then it performs the search in the string `str`, starting from position stored in its `regexp.lastIndex` property. And, if it finds a match, then sets `regexp.lastIndex` to the index immediately after the match.\n\nWhen a regexp is created, its `lastIndex` is `0`.\n\nSo, successive calls to `regexp.exec(str)` return matches one after another.\n\nAn example (with flag `pattern:g`):\n\n```js run\nlet str = 'let varName';\n\nlet regexp = /\\w+/g;\nalert(regexp.lastIndex); // 0 (initially lastIndex=0)\n\nlet word1 = regexp.exec(str);\nalert(word1[0]); // let (1st word)\nalert(regexp.lastIndex); // 3 (position after the match)\n\nlet word2 = regexp.exec(str);\nalert(word2[0]); // varName (2nd word)\nalert(regexp.lastIndex); // 11 (position after the match)\n\nlet word3 = regexp.exec(str);\nalert(word3); // null (no more matches)\nalert(regexp.lastIndex); // 0 (resets at search end)\n```\n\nEvery match is returned as an array with groups and additional properties.\n\nWe can get all matches in the loop:\n\n```js run\nlet str = 'let varName';\nlet regexp = /\\w+/g;\n\nlet result;\n\nwhile (result = regexp.exec(str)) {\n  alert( `Found ${result[0]} at position ${result.index}` );\n  // Found let at position 0, then\n  // Found varName at position 4\n}\n```\n\nSuch use of `regexp.exec` is an alternative to method `str.matchAll`.\n\nUnlike other methods, we can set our own `lastIndex`, to start the search from the given position.\n\nFor instance, let's find a word, starting from position `4`:\n\n```js run\nlet str = 'let varName = \"value\"';\n\nlet regexp = /\\w+/g; // without flag \"g\", property lastIndex is ignored\n\n*!*\nregexp.lastIndex = 4;\n*/!*\n\nlet word = regexp.exec(str);\nalert(word); // varName\n```\n\nWe performed a search of `pattern:\\w+`, starting from position `regexp.lastIndex = 4`.\n\nPlease note: the search starts at position `lastIndex` and then goes further. If there's no word at position `lastIndex`, but it's somewhere after it, then it will be found:\n\n```js run\nlet str = 'let varName = \"value\"';\n\nlet regexp = /\\w+/g;\n\n*!*\nregexp.lastIndex = 3;\n*/!*\n\nlet word = regexp.exec(str);\nalert(word[0]); // varName\nalert(word.index); // 4\n```\n\n...So, with flag `pattern:g` property `lastIndex` sets the starting position for the search.\n\n**Flag `pattern:y` makes `regexp.exec` to look exactly at position `lastIndex`, not before, not after it.**\n\nHere's the same search with flag `pattern:y`:\n\n```js run\nlet str = 'let varName = \"value\"';\n\nlet regexp = /\\w+/y;\n\nregexp.lastIndex = 3;\nalert( regexp.exec(str) ); // null (there's a space at position 3, not a word)\n\nregexp.lastIndex = 4;\nalert( regexp.exec(str) ); // varName (word at position 4)\n```\n\nAs we can see, regexp `pattern:/\\w+/y` doesn't match at position `3` (unlike the flag  `pattern:g`), but matches at position `4`.\n\nImagine, we have a long text, and there are no matches in it, at all. Then searching with flag `pattern:g` will go till the end of the text, and this will take significantly more time than the search with flag `pattern:y`.\n\nIn such tasks like lexical analysis, there are usually many searches at an exact position. Using flag `pattern:y` is the key for a good performance.",

If the `regexp` doesn't have flag `pattern:g`, then it returns the first match as an array with capturing groups and properties `index` (position of the match), `input` (input string, equals `str`):\n\n    ```js run\n    let str = \"I love JavaScript\";\n\n    let result = str.match(/Java(Script)/);\n\n    alert( result[0] );     // JavaScript (full match)\n    alert( result[1] );     // Script (first capturing group)\n    alert( result.length ); // 2\n\n    // Additional information:\n    alert( result.index );  // 0 (match position)\n    alert( result.input );  // I love JavaScript (source string)\n    ```\n\n2. If the `regexp` has flag `pattern:g`, then it returns an array of all matches as strings, without capturing groups and other details.\n    ```js run\n    let str = \"I love JavaScript\";\n\n    let result = str.match(/Java(Script)/g);\n\n    alert( result[0] ); // JavaScript\n    alert( result.length ); // 1\n    ```\n\n3. If there are no matches, no matter if there's flag `pattern:g` or not, `null` is returned.\n\n    That's an important nuance. If there are no matches, we don't get an empty array, but `null`. It's easy to make a mistake forgetting about it, e.g.:\n\n    ```js run\n    let str = \"I love JavaScript\";\n\n    let result = str.match(/HTML/);\n\n    alert(result); // null\n    alert(result.length); // Error: Cannot read property 'length' of null\n    ```\n\n    If we want the result to be an array, we can write like this:\n\n    ```js\n    let result = str.match(regexp) || [];\n    ```\n\n## str.matchAll(regexp)\n\n[recent browser=\"new\"]\n\nThe method `str.matchAll(regexp)` is a \"newer, improved\" variant of `str.match`.\n\nIt's used mainly to search for all matches with all groups.\n\nThere are 3 differences from `match`:\n\n1. It returns an iterable object with matches instead of an array. We can make a regular array from it using `Array.from`.\n2. Every match is returned as an array with capturing groups (the same format as `str.match` without flag `pattern:g`).\n3. If there are no results, it returns not `null`, but an empty iterable object.\n\nUsage example:\n\n```js run\nlet str = '<h1>Hello, world!</h1>';\nlet regexp = /<(.*?)>/g;\n\nlet matchAll = str.matchAll(regexp);\n\nalert(matchAll); // [object RegExp String Iterator], not array, but an iterable\n\nmatchAll = Array.from(matchAll); // array now\n\nlet firstMatch = matchAll[0];\nalert( firstMatch[0] );  // <h1>\nalert( firstMatch[1] );  // h1\nalert( firstMatch.index );  // 0\nalert( firstMatch.input );  // <h1>Hello, world!</h1>\n```\n\nIf we use `for..of` to loop over `matchAll` matches, then we don't need `Array.from` any more.\n\n## str.split(regexp|substr, limit)\n\nSplits the string using the regexp (or a substring) as a delimiter.\n\nWe can use `split` with strings, like this:\n\n```js run\nalert('12-34-56'.split('-')) // array of [12, 34, 56]\n```\n\nBut we can split by a regular expression, the same way:\n\n```js run\nalert('12, 34, 56'.split(/,\\s*/)) // array of [12, 34, 56]\n```\n\n## str.search(regexp)\n\nThe method `str.search(regexp)` returns the position of the first match or `-1` if none found:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"A drop of ink may make a million think\";\n\nalert( str.search( /ink/i ) ); // 10 (first match position)\n```\n\n**The important limitation: `search` only finds the first match.**\n\nIf we need positions of further matches, we should use other means, such as finding them all with `str.matchAll(regexp)`.\n\n## str.replace(str|regexp, str|func)\n\nThis is a generic method for searching and replacing, one of most useful ones. The swiss army knife for searching and replacing.  \n\nWe can use it without regexps, to search and replace a substring:\n\n```js run\n// replace a dash by a colon\nalert('12-34-56'.replace(\"-\", \":\")) // 12:34-56\n```\n\nThere's a pitfall though.\n\n**When the first argument of `replace` is a string, it only replaces the first match.**\n\nYou can see that in the example above: only the first `\"-\"` is replaced by `\":\"`.\n\nTo find all hyphens, we need to use not the string `\"-\"`, but a regexp `pattern:/-/g`, with the obligatory `pattern:g` flag:\n\n```js run\n// replace all dashes by a colon\nalert( '12-34-56'.replace( *!*/-/g*/!*, \":\" ) )  // 12:34:56\n```\n\nThe second argument is a replacement string. We can use special character in it:\n\n| Symbols | Action in the replacement string |\n|--------|--------|\n|`$&`|inserts the whole match|\n|<code>$&#096;</code>|inserts a part of the string before the match|\n|`$'`|inserts a part of the string after the match|\n|`$n`|if `n` is a 1-2 digit number, inserts the contents of n-th capturing group, for details see [](info:regexp-groups)|\n|`$<name>`|inserts the contents of the parentheses with the given `name`, for details see [](info:regexp-groups)|\n|`$$`|inserts character `$` |\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"John Smith\";\n\n// swap first and last name\nalert(str.replace(/(john) (smith)/i, '$2, $1')) // Smith, John\n```\n\n**For situations that require \"smart\" replacements, the second argument can be a function.**\n\nIt will be called for each match, and the returned value will be inserted as a replacement.\n\nThe function is called with arguments `func(match, p1, p2, ..., pn, offset, input, groups)`:\n\n1. `match` -- the match,\n2. `p1, p2, ..., pn` -- contents of capturing groups (if there are any),\n3. `offset` -- position of the match,\n4. `input` -- the source string,\n5. `groups` -- an object with named groups.\n\nIf there are no parentheses in the regexp, then there are only 3 arguments: `func(str, offset, input)`.\n\nFor example, let's uppercase all matches:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"html and css\";\n\nlet result = str.replace(/html|css/gi, str => str.toUpperCase());\n\nalert(result); // HTML and CSS\n```\n\nReplace each match by its position in the string:\n\n```js run\nalert(\"Ho-Ho-ho\".replace(/ho/gi, (match, offset) => offset)); // 0-3-6\n```\n\nIn the example below there are two parentheses, so the replacement function is called with 5 arguments: the first is the full match, then 2 parentheses, and after it (not used in the example) the match position and the source string:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"John Smith\";\n\nlet result = str.replace(/(\\w+) (\\w+)/, (match, name, surname) => `${surname}, ${name}`);\n\nalert(result); // Smith, John\n```\n\nIf there are many groups, it's convenient to use rest parameters to access them:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"John Smith\";\n\nlet result = str.replace(/(\\w+) (\\w+)/, (...match) => `${match[2]}, ${match[1]}`);\n\nalert(result); // Smith, John\n```\n\nOr, if we're using named groups, then `groups` object with them is always the last, so we can obtain it like this:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"John Smith\";\n\nlet result = str.replace(/(?<name>\\w+) (?<surname>\\w+)/, (...match) => {\n  let groups = match.pop();\n\n  return `${groups.surname}, ${groups.name}`;\n});\n\nalert(result); // Smith, John\n```\n\nUsing a function gives us the ultimate replacement power, because it gets all the information about the match, has access to outer variables and can do everything.\n\n## regexp.exec(str)\n\nThe method `regexp.exec(str)` method returns a match for `regexp` in the string `str`.  Unlike previous methods, it's called on a regexp, not on a string.\n\nIt behaves differently depending on whether the regexp has flag `pattern:g`.\n\nIf there's no `pattern:g`, then `regexp.exec(str)` returns the first match exactly as  `str.match(regexp)`. This behavior doesn't bring anything new.\n\nBut if there's flag `pattern:g`, then:\n- A call to `regexp.exec(str)` returns the first match and saves the position immediately after it in the property `regexp.lastIndex`.\n- The next such call starts the search from position `regexp.lastIndex`, returns the next match and saves the position after it in `regexp.lastIndex`.\n- ...And so on.\n- If there are no matches, `regexp.exec` returns `null` and resets `regexp.lastIndex` to `0`.\n\nSo, repeated calls return all matches one after another, using property `regexp.lastIndex` to keep track of the current search position.\n\nIn the past, before the method `str.matchAll` was added to JavaScript, calls of `regexp.exec` were used in the loop to get all matches with groups:\n\n```js run\nlet str = 'More about JavaScript at https://javascript.info';\nlet regexp = /javascript/ig;\n\nlet result;\n\nwhile (result = regexp.exec(str)) {\n  alert( `Found ${result[0]} at position ${result.index}` );\n  // Found JavaScript at position 11, then\n  // Found javascript at position 33\n}\n```\n\nThis works now as well, although for newer browsers `str.matchAll` is usually more convenient.\n\n**We can use `regexp.exec` to search from a given position by manually setting `lastIndex`.**\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet str = 'Hello, world!';\n\nlet regexp = /\\w+/g; // without flag \"g\", lastIndex property is ignored\nregexp.lastIndex = 5; // search from 5th position (from the comma)\n\nalert( regexp.exec(str) ); // world\n```\n\nIf the regexp has flag `pattern:y`, then the search will be performed exactly at the  position `regexp.lastIndex`, not any further.\n\nLet's replace flag `pattern:g` with `pattern:y` in the example above. There will be no matches, as there's no word at position `5`:\n\n```js run\nlet str = 'Hello, world!';\n\nlet regexp = /\\w+/y;\nregexp.lastIndex = 5; // search exactly at position 5\n\nalert( regexp.exec(str) ); // null\n```\n\nThat's convenient for situations when we need to \"read\" something from the string by a regexp at the exact position, not somewhere further.\n\n## regexp.test(str)\n\nThe method `regexp.test(str)` looks for a match and returns `true/false` whether it exists.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"I love JavaScript\";\n\n// these two tests do the same\nalert( *!*/love/i*/!*.test(str) ); // true\nalert( str.search(*!*/love/i*/!*) != -1 ); // true\n```\n\nAn example with the negative answer:\n\n```js run\nlet str = \"Bla-bla-bla\";\n\nalert( *!*/love/i*/!*.test(str) ); // false\nalert( str.search(*!*/love/i*/!*) != -1 ); // false\n```\n\nIf the regexp has flag `pattern:g`, then `regexp.test` looks from `regexp.lastIndex` property and updates this property, just like `regexp.exec`.\n\nSo we can use it to search from a given position:\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /love/gi;\n\nlet str = \"I love JavaScript\";\n\n// start the search from position 10:\nregexp.lastIndex = 10;\nalert( regexp.test(str) ); // false (no match)\n```\n\n````warn header=\"Same global regexp tested repeatedly on different sources may fail\"\nIf we apply the same global regexp to different inputs, it may lead to wrong result, because `regexp.test` call advances `regexp.lastIndex` property, so the search in another string may start from non-zero position.\n\nFor instance, here we call `regexp.test` twice on the same text, and the second time fails:\n\n```js run\nlet regexp = /javascript/g;  // (regexp just created: regexp.lastIndex=0)\n\nalert( regexp.test(\"javascript\") ); // true (regexp.lastIndex=10 now)\nalert( regexp.test(\"javascript\") ); // false\n```\n\nThat's exactly because `regexp.lastIndex` is non-zero in the second test.\n\nTo work around that, we can set `regexp.lastIndex = 0` before each search. Or instead of calling methods on regexp, use string methods `str.match/search/...`, they don't use `lastIndex`.\n````",
